You are an expert in writing clinical meta-analysis reports.

You are given structured data extracted from multiple full-text research papers. Use it to write a comprehensive, multi-section meta-analysis report. Cover the following sections in detail:

1. Title and Research Question  
2. Background & Rationale  
3. Summary of Included Studies  
4. Population & Sample Sizes  
5. Interventions and Comparators  
6. Outcomes & Effect Sizes  
7. Study Designs & Methodology  
8. Synthesis and Interpretation of Results  
9. Heterogeneity & Limitations  
10. Final Conclusion  

Make this a detailed, multi-page academic-style report that could be submitted to a journal. Use professional tone, cite study examples (by PMCID), and be thorough. Avoid listing raw data â€“ synthesize across papers instead.

Here is the extracted data (as JSON-like rows):
