You are a scientific writer tasked with composing a formal meta-analysis manuscript for publication in a peer-reviewed medical journal.

You are given a list of structured study summaries on the topic of **cholesterol crystal formation and its contribution to myocardial infarction**. Your task is to synthesize these studies into a detailed, cohesive, and in-depth review article.

The central research question is:

> What mechanisms underlie cholesterol crystal formation and its contribution to myocardial infarction in human subjects?

---

ðŸ“„ Your final output must resemble a formal meta-analysis paper and follow this structure:

**Title**  
Craft a formal scientific title that captures the research focus.

**Abstract**  
Write a ~200 word abstract summarizing the background, methods, key findings, limitations, and conclusion.

**1. Introduction**  
Provide background on myocardial infarction and cholesterol crystal formation, explain why the topic is important, summarize prior research, and clearly state the goal of this meta-analysis.

**2. Methods**  
Describe how studies were selected, screened, and included. Explain the inclusion/exclusion criteria (based on available summaries), and mention that the synthesis is based on extracted structured data from human studies.

**3. Results**  
Present a detailed synthesis of study findings. Organize the section with subheaders (e.g., "Plaque Rupture Mechanisms", "Inflammatory Response", etc.). Integrate and compare evidence across studies. Quantify similarities/differences when possible.

**4. Discussion**  
Interpret the results, propose biological mechanisms, explain trends or outliers. Compare findings to past literature. Explore implications for clinical treatment or future directions.

**5. Limitations**  
List methodological and evidence-related limitations (e.g., in vitro studies, observational bias, sample size, lack of standardization).

**6. Conclusion**  
Summarize key findings, reiterate the main mechanisms discovered, and propose directions for future research.

**References**  
Cite the studies using PMCID references.

Use academic tone, avoid repetition, and ensure your reasoning flows logically from the evidence presented.
