38590611,"The prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, chronic kidney disease, and obesity in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and the description of concurrent treatments: A two-center retrospective cross-sectional study in Saudi Arabia.","Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), heart failure (HF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and obesity are associated with increased morbidity and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Nonetheless, their prevalence among patients with T2DM in Saudi Arabia (SA) remains unknown.

37352067,Pre-aspirin use has no benefit on the neurological disability and mortality after cardiovascular events: A nation-wide population-based cohort study.,"To evaluate the effects of aspirin in the primary prevention, we evaluated disability grades and mortality after ischemic/hemorrhagic stroke and myocardial infarction (MI). A retrospective nation-wide propensity score-matched cohort study was performed using the Korean National Health Information Database. From 3,060,639 subjects who were older than 55 and performed national health examinations in 2004 and 2005, we selected the aspirin group (N = 8770) was composed of patients who had received aspirin prior to cardiovascular events. Cox proportional hazards model was used to compare the acquisition times for neurologic disability grades and survival times between the aspirin and control groups. Only in hemorrhagic stroke, the severe neurologic disability risk was higher in the aspirin group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.21; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.42). The aspirin group was associated with higher 90-day (HR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.23-1.44) and long-term mortality risk (HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.03-1.10) after pooling 3 events. The old age was a strong risk factor for 90-day mortality in hemorrhagic stroke (50s: reference; 60s: HR 2.21, 95% CI 1.50-3.25; 70s: HR 3.63, 95% CI 2.48-5.30; 80s: HR 6.69, 95% CI 4.54-9.65; >90s: HR 11.28, 95% CI 6.46-19.70). Pre-aspirin use in cardiovascular events has detrimental effects on severe neurological disability in hemorrhagic stroke and short-/long-term mortality in 3 cardiovascular events. The use of aspirin for the primary prevention especially in the elderly should be very cautious because the old age is a strong risk factor for 90-day mortality after hemorrhagic stroke.",Medicine,2023,Medicine (Baltimore),Kim Jong Hun; Park Dougho; Lim Hyun Sun; Kang Min Jin; Lee Jun Hong; Yoon Seo Yeon; Kim Hyoung Seop,"Department of Neurology, National Health Insurance Service Ilsan Hospital, Goyang, South Korea.; Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Pohang Stroke and Spine Hospital, Pohang, South Korea.; Research and Analysis Team, National Health Insurance Service Ilsan Hospital, Goyang, South Korea.; Research and Analysis Team, National Health Insurance Service Ilsan Hospital, Goyang, South Korea.; Department of Neurology, National Health Insurance Service Ilsan Hospital, Goyang, South Korea.; Department of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation, Korea University Guro Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea.; Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, National Health Insurance Service Ilsan Hospital, Goyang, South Korea.",10.1097/MD.0000000000034109,PMC10289750,N/A

34526727,Long term dual antiplatelet therapy after myocardial infarction: retrospective analysis in an outpatient population.,"Long term treatment with ticagrelor 60 mg and low-dose aspirin are indicated after acute coronary syndrome (ACS). We retrospectively reviewed aggregate data of 187 patients (155 M and 38 F) (mean age 63.8±9 years) in follow up after ACS with at least one high risk condition (Multivessel disease, diabetes, GFR<60 mL/min, history of prior myocardial infarction, age >65 years) treated with ticagrelor 60 mg twice daily (after 90 mg twice daily for 12 months). The results were compared with findings (characteristics of the patients at baseline, outcomes, bleeding) of PEGASUS-TIMI 54 trial and Eu Label. The highrisk groups were represented as follows: multivessel disease 105 pts (82%), diabetes 63 pts (33%), GFR< 60 mL/min 27 pts (14%), history of prior MI 33 pts (17%), >65 year aged 85 pts (45%). Treatment was withdrawn in 7 patients: 3 cases showed atrial fibrillation and were placed on oral anticoagulant drugs, one developed intracranial bleeding, in three patients a temporary withdrawal was due to surgery (1 colon polyposis and 2 cases of bladder papilloma). Chest pain without myocardial infarction occurred in 16 patients (revascularization was required in 9 patients). Dyspnea was present in 15 patients, but was not a cause for discontinuation of therapy. Long term treatment with ticagrelor 60 mg twice daily plus aspirin 100 mg/day showed a favourable benefit/risk profile after ACS.  In this study all patients had been given ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily for 12 months and the 60 mg twice daily dosage was started immediately thereafter, unlike PEGASUS-TIMI 54 trial in which it was prescribed within a period ranging from 1 day to 1 year after discontinuation of the 90 mg dose. This makes our results more consistent with current clinical practice. However, a careful outpatient follow-up and constant counseling are mandatory to check out compliance to therapy and adverse side effects.",Monaldi archives for chest disease = Archivio Monaldi per le malattie del torace,2021,Monaldi Arch Chest Dis,Ratti Gennaro; Maglione Antonio; Biglietto Emilia; Monda Cinzia; Elettrico Ciro; Ratti Federica; Fulgione Cosimo; Mallardo Mario; Tammaro Paolo,"Cardiology/ICU Department, S.

26529110,Acute Myocardial Infarction Risk in Patients with Coronary Artery Disease Doubled after Upper Gastrointestinal Tract Bleeding: A Nationwide Nested Case-Control Study.,"Prior studies of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are small, and long-term effects of UGIB on AMI have not been delineated. We investigated whether UGIB in patients diagnosed with coronary artery disease (CAD) increased their risk of subsequent AMI. This was a population-based, nested case-control study using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. After propensity-score matching for age, gender, comorbidities, CAD date, and follow-up duration, we identified 1,677 new-onset CAD patients with AMI (AMI[+]) between 2001 and 2006 as the case group and 10,062 new-onset CAD patients without (AMI[-]) as the control group. Conditional logistic regression was used to examine the association between UGIB and AMI. Compared with UGIB[-] patients, UGIB[+] patients had twice the risk for subsequent AMI (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.72-2.50). In the subgroup analysis for gender and age, UGIB[+] women (AOR = 2.70; 95% CI, 2.03-3.57) and patients < 65 years old (AOR = 2.23; 95% CI, 1.56-3.18) had higher odds of an AMI. UGIB[+] AMI[+] patients used nonsignificantly less aspirin than did UGIB[-] AMI[+] patients (27.69% vs. 35.61%, respectively). UGIB increased the risk of subsequent AMI in CAD patients, especially in women and patients < 65. This suggests that physicians need to use earlier and more aggressive intervention to detect UGIB and prevent AMI in CAD patients.",PloS one,2015,PLoS One,Wu Chia-Jung; Lin Hung-Jung; Weng Shih-Feng; Hsu Chien-Chin; Wang Jhi-Joung; Su Shih-Bin; Huang Chien-Cheng; Guo How-Ran,"Department of Emergency Medicine, Chi-Mei Medical Center, Tainan, Taiwan.; Department of Emergency Medicine, Chi-Mei Medical Center, Tainan, Taiwan; Department of Emergency Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Biotechnology, Southern Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Tainan, Taiwan.; Department of Medical Research, Chi-Mei Medical Center, Tainan, Taiwan; Department of Healthcare Administration and Medical Informatics, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.; Department of Emergency Medicine, Chi-Mei Medical Center, Tainan, Taiwan; Department of Biotechnology, Southern Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Tainan, Taiwan.; Department of Medical Research, Chi-Mei Medical Center, Tainan, Taiwan.; Department of Occupational Medicine, Chi-Mei Medical Center, Tainan, Taiwan; Department of Leisure, Recreation and Tourism Management, Southern Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Tainan, Taiwan; Department of Medical Research, Chi Mei Medical Center, Liouying, Tainan, Taiwan.; Department of Emergency Medicine, Chi-Mei Medical Center, Tainan, Taiwan; Department of Occupational Medicine, Chi-Mei Medical Center, Tainan, Taiwan; Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan; Department of Child Care and Education, Southern Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Tainan, Taiwan; Department of Geriatrics and Geronotology, Chi-Mei Medical Center, Tainan, Taiwan.; Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan; Department of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, Tainan, Taiwan.",10.1371/journal.pone.0142000,PMC4631331,N/A

15891266,Antibiotics and risk of first-time hospitalization for myocardial infarction: a population-based case-control study.,"There is increasing evidence that inflammation plays an important role in atherosclerosis. Such inflammation is likely related to the presence of infectious organisms. Hence, we examined whether the use of antibiotic drugs decreases the risk of first-time myocardial infarction (MI). We identified 6737 cases of first-time hospitalization for MI, and 67,364 age- and gender-matched, population-based controls during 1991-2002, using data from the County Hospital Discharge Registry and the Civil Registration System of North Jutland County, Denmark. All prescriptions for antibiotics prior to the hospitalization for MI were identified through a prescription database. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) associated with antibiotic use, adjusted for potential confounding factors including previous discharge diagnoses of hypertension, chronic bronchitis and emphysema, alcoholism, liver cirrhosis, or diabetes mellitus and prescriptions for anti-hypertensive drugs, antidiabetic drugs, lipid-lowering agents, high-dose aspirin, platelet inhibitors, oral anticoagulants, or hormone replacement therapy. The use of any one type of antibiotic in the 3 years before hospitalization was not associated with a decreased risk of MI; the adjusted ORs with corresponding 95% confidence intervals were 1.07, 1.00-1.14 for penicillins; 1.15, 1.00-1.33 for macrolides; 0.95, 0.65-1.39 for tetracyclines; 1.25, 0.84-1.87 for quinolones; and 0.95, 0.80-1.12 for sulfonamides. A slight increase in the risk of MI was seen with the use of more than one type of antibiotic in the preceding 3 years (OR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.09-1.27).

11524055,A risk score system for predicting adverse outcomes and magnitude of benefit with glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor therapy in patients with unstable angina pectoris.,"Clinical outcomes of patients with unstable angina are variable. We sought to identify predictors of adverse clinical outcomes in patients with unstable angina and to investigate whether these factors would predict the magnitude of benefit achieved with platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibition. We analyzed 20 variables in the 1,915 patients enrolled in the Platelet Receptor Inhibition for Ischemic Syndrome Management in Patients Limited by Unstable Signs and Symptoms trial. Five independent predictors were identified: age >65 years, prior coronary artery bypass grafting, antecedent aspirin use, antecedent beta-blocker use, and ST depressions on the presenting electrocardiogram. A risk score system was created using these predictors in which patients were assigned 1 point for the presence of each risk factor. There was a progressive increase in the rate of the composite end point of death, myocardial infarction, or refractory ischemia at 7 days with an increasing number of risk factors. For patients treated with heparin alone, the composite end point event rate was 6.5% in the group with 0 or 1 predictor, 14.6% in the group with 2 predictors, 22.7% in the group with 3 predictors, and 37.1% in the group with 4 or 5 predictors (p <0.00001). When dividing patients into low- (0 or 1 point), medium- (2 or 3 points), and high-risk (4 or 5 points) groups, the addition of tirofiban to heparin therapy was associated with no significant benefit in the low-risk group, a 5.2% absolute reduction in the medium-risk group (p = 0.05), and a 16% absolute reduction in the high-risk group (p = 0.0055). Thus, we have developed a risk score system using 5 variables that can be used to identify patients at high risk for death and cardiac ischemic events and who experience the greatest benefit from the addition of a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor to their treatment regimen.",The American journal of cardiology,2001,Am J Cardiol,Sabatine M S; Januzzi J L; Snapinn S; Théroux P; Jang I K,"Division of Cardiology, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02114, USA.",10.1016/s0002-9149(01)01724-6,,N/A

BACKGROUND Cardiac rupture is responsible for nearly 15% of all in-hospital deaths among patients with myocardial infarction (MI) given thrombolytic agents. Little is known about specific patient- and treatment-related risk factors. METHODS Patients (n = 3,759) with MI participating in the Thrombolysis and Thrombin Inhibition in Myocardial Infarction 9A and B trials received intravenous thrombolytic therapy, aspirin and either heparin (5,000 U bolus, 1,000 to 1,300 U/h infusion) or hirudin (0.1 to 0.6 mg/kg bolus, 0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg/h infusion) for at least 96 h. A diagnosis of cardiac rupture was made clinically in patients with sudden electromechanical dissociation in the absence of preceding congestive heart failure, slowly progressive hemodynamic compromise or malignant ventricular arrhythmias. RESULTS A total of 65 rupture events (1.7%) were reported-all were fatal, and a majority occurred within 48 h of treatment Patients with cardiac rupture were older, of lower body weight and stature and more likely to be female than those without rupture (all p < 0.001). By multivariable analysis, age >70 years (odds ratio [OR] 3.77; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.06, 6.91), female gender (OR 2.87; 95% CI 1.44, 5.73) and prior angina (OR 1.82; 95% CI 1.05, 3.16) were independently associated with cardiac rupture. Independent predictors of nonrupture death included age >70 years (OR 3.68; 95% CI 2.53, 5.35) and prior MI (OR 2.14; 95%, CI 1.45, 3.17). There was no association between the type of thrombin inhibition, the intensity of anticoagulation and cardiac rapture. CONCLUSIONS Cardiac rupture following thrombolytic therapy tends to occur in older patients and may explain the disproportionately high mortality rate among women in prior dinical trials.

However, ticlopidine causes neutropenia in 1% of patients when administered for >2 weeks, and little is known about the duration that ticlopidine needs be administered to prevent stent thrombosis.",Circulation,1999,Circulation,Berger P B; Bell M R; Hasdai D; Grill D E; Melby S; Holmes D R,"Division of Cardiovascular Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine and the Section of Biostatistics, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA. berger.peter@mayo.edu",10.1161/01.cir.99.2.248,,N/A
9527080,Frequency of adverse clinical events in the 12 months following successful intracoronary stent placement in patients treated with aspirin and ticlopidine (without warfarin).,"Little is known about the frequency of adverse events in the year following stent placement in patients treated with aspirin and ticlopidine, without warfarin. We analyzed the first such 234 consecutive patients treated at our hospital between October 1994 and December 1995. Their mean age was 62+/-12 years; 40% had had a prior myocardial infarction, 22% had undergone coronary artery bypass surgery, and 65% had multivessel disease. The indication for stent placement was dissection or abrupt closure in 24% of patients and suboptimal balloon angioplasty results in 14%; placement was elective in 62% of patients. Three hundred forty-five coronary segments were treated in the 234 patients; 305 stents (1.3 stents/patient) were placed. Palmaz-Schatz coronary stents (75%), Gianturco-Roubin stents (21%), and Johnson & Johnson biliary stents (4%) were used. Mean nominal stent size was 3.4+/-0.4 mm. High-pressure inflations (> or = 14 atm, mean 17+/-2) were performed in all patients. The mean residual stenosis was 3+/-5% by visual estimate. Intravascular ultrasound was utilized to facilitate stent placement in 53% of patients. Mean follow-up was 1.6+/-0.5 years. There were no deaths, Q-wave myocardial infarctions, coronary artery bypass operations, or repeat angioplasty procedures required during the remainder of the hospitalization or in 30 days after stent placement; stent thrombosis did not occur. Kaplan-Meier analysis of adverse events in the 6 months following the procedure revealed a mortality rate of 0.9%; the rate of myocardial infarction (Q-wave or non-Q-wave) was 1.3%. Bypass surgery was performed in 0.9% and angioplasty for in-stent restenosis was performed in 9.5% of patients. Any 1 of these events occurred in 11.7% of patients in the 6 months after the procedure. The corresponding event rates at 1 year were 1.3%, 2.2%, 3.5%, and 12.2%, respectively; any 1 of these events occurred in 16.5% of patients. In patients receiving intracoronary stents of varying designs followed by high-pressure postdeployment inflations in whom an excellent visual angiographic result is achieved, antithrombotic therapy with aspirin and ticlopidine is associated with a very low frequency of adverse cardiovascular events in the 12 months following the procedure regardless of the indication for stent placement.",The American journal of cardiology,1998,Am J Cardiol,Berger P B; Bell M R; Grill D E; Melby S; Holmes D R,"Division of Cardiovascular Diseases and Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, USA.",10.1016/s0002-9149(97)01005-9,,N/A
7794087,Does aspirin consumption affect the presentation or severity of acute myocardial infarction?,"While consumption of aspirin has been shown to decrease the occurrence of nonfatal cardiac events, the majority of studies have not demonstrated any impact of aspirin intake on cardiovascular mortality. The present population-based study explores the possibility that aspirin consumption affects the presentation and severity of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and hence the likelihood of clinical detection.",Archives of internal medicine,1995,Arch Intern Med,Col N F; Yarzbski J; Gore J M; Alpert J S; Goldberg R J,"Department of Family and Community Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, USA.",,,N/A

8309503,Anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation and stroke prevention.,"Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) has a prevalence of about 1% in the 60- to 70-year age group, increasing to above 4% in persons older than 80 years. The yearly stroke incidence in NVAF patients is 3-8%, which is 5-7 times higher than that in age-matched persons in sinus rhythm. In five independent studies of stroke prevention in NVAF patients, anticoagulation therapy resulted in a risk reduction of stroke of about 65%. The risk of intracerebral hemorrhage was 0.3% per year during warfarin therapy compared with 0.1% in the placebo group. In one study aspirin reduced the risk of thromboembolic events by 42% while another study found a nonsignificant effect of aspirin. The following variables were identified as risk factors for stroke in the individual studies: prior myocardial infarction, increasing age, mitral annular calcification, history of hypertension, congestive heart failure and previous arterial thromboembolism. A pooled analysis of risk factors in the placebo-treated patients of the five studies is ongoing.",Neuroepidemiology,1993,Neuroepidemiology,Boysen G,"Department of Neurology, Hvidovre Hospital, University of Copenhagen, Denmark.",10.1159/000110329,,N/A
2117618,Stroke and acute myocardial infarction in the thrombolytic era: clinical correlates and long-term prognosis.,"Thirteen (1.8%) of 708 patients with acute myocardial infarction treated with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator in the Thrombolysis and Angioplasty in Myocardial Infarction (TAMI) I, II and III trials developed a stroke. Four strokes were hemorrhagic and nine were nonhemorrhagic. Of five prespecified risk factors for intracranial hemorrhage (age greater than 65 years, history of hypertension, history of prior cerebrovascular disease, aspirin use and acute hypertension), two patients had two risk factors and one patient had one risk factor. However, 80% of patients without intracranial hemorrhage had at least one risk factor and 31% had two risk factors. No patient with a prior stroke or transient ischemic attack (all greater than 6 months previously) had an intracranial hemorrhage. Of three prespecified risk factors for nonhemorrhagic stroke (atrial fibrillation, prior cerebrovascular disease and large anterior wall infarction), only the occurrence of a large anterior myocardial infarction (with ejection fraction less than 45%) was a predictor (p = 0.0015). The in-hospital death rate was 25% for patients with hemorrhagic stroke versus 11% for patients with a non-hemorrhagic stroke and 6% for those patients without a stroke. Furthermore, the hospital stay was greater than 50% longer in patients who had a stroke than in those who did not. Thus, intracranial hemorrhage remains an unpredictable risk in patients treated with thrombolytic therapy and cerebral infarction is related to anterior myocardial infarction and poor left ventricular function. Both types of stroke are associated with substantial morbidity and mortality.",Journal of the American College of Cardiology,1990,J Am Coll Cardiol,O'Connor C M; Califf R M; Massey E W; Mark D B; Kereiakes D J; Candela R J; Abbottsmith C; George B; Stack R S; Aronson L,"Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710.",10.1016/0735-1097(90)90338-p,,N/A
