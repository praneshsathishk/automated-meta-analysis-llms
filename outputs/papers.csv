40225450,Role of Dual Pathway Inhibition in Secondary Prevention of Coronary Artery Disease.,"Introduction Coronary artery disease (CAD) continues to be a significant global health challenge, contributing to high rates of morbidity and mortality despite advancements in medical care. Dual-pathway inhibition (DPI) represents a major advancement in the secondary prevention of CAD by targeting both platelet aggregation and thrombin generation. Unlike traditional single-pathway antiplatelet therapy (e.g., aspirin or P2Y12 inhibitors), DPI provides a synergistic approach to reduce the residual cardiovascular risk that persists despite optimal medical therapy. Objective To evaluate the efficacy and safety of DPI compared to standard single-pathway antiplatelet therapy in reducing cardiovascular events in patients with CAD. Methodology This prospective observational cohort study was conducted at Shalamar Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan, from September 2023 to August 2024. Data were collected from 147 patients diagnosed with stable CAD or who had experienced a recent acute coronary syndrome. Patients were randomly assigned into two groups: the DPI group and the control group. The DPI group (n=74) received a combination of low-dose rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice daily) and aspirin (81 mg daily), while the control group (n=73) received standard single-pathway antiplatelet therapy with aspirin (81 mg daily). Results The mean age was similar in both groups, with 56.67 ± 8.01 years in the DPI group and 58.92 ± 9.23 years in the control group (p=0.48). The proportion of male patients was comparable, with 50(68%) in the DPI group and 48(66%) in the control group (p=0.78). Prevalence rates of hypertension [53(72%) vs. 54(74%), p=0.74], diabetes mellitus [31(42%) vs. 29(39%), p=0.69], and previous myocardial infarction (MI) [35(48%) vs. 37(51%), p=0.66] were nearly identical across groups. Similarly, smoking history showed no significant difference, with 26(35%) in the DPI group and 24(33%) in the control group (p=0.81). Cardiovascular deaths were less frequent in the DPI group [2(2.7%)] compared to the control group [5(6.8%)], although this difference did not reach statistical significance (p=0.18). Similarly, the incidence of non-fatal MI [3(4.1%) vs. 7(9.6%), p=0.12] and non-fatal stroke [2(2.7%) vs. 3(4.1%), p=0.63] was lower in the DPI group but not statistically significant. Conclusion It is concluded that DPI is an effective strategy for reducing residual cardiovascular risk in patients with CAD. By combining platelet aggregation and thrombin generation inhibition, DPI significantly lowers the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events compared to single-pathway antiplatelet therapy.",Cureus,2025,Cureus,Ahmad Fraz; Husnain Ali; Hayat Muhammad Fakhar; Ashraf Muhammad Abdullah; Arif Muhammad Ammar; Butt Muhammad Zarrar A; Qureshi Amna Junaid; Hamza Muhammad,"Cardiology, Shalamar Hospital, Lahore, PAK.; Cardiology, Shalamar Hospital, Lahore, PAK.; Cardiology, Shalamar Hospital, Lahore, PAK.; Cardiology, Shalamar Hospital, Lahore, PAK.; Cardiology, Fatima Memorial Hospital, Lahore, PAK.; Cardiology, Fatima Memorial Hospital College of Medicine and Dentistry, Lahore, PAK.; Internal Medicine, Shalamar Hospital, Lahore, PAK.; Internal Medicine, Combined Military Hospital, Muzaffarabad, PAK.",10.7759/cureus.80504,PMC11993472,N/A

Their generation in arterial disease, and their modulation by cardiovascular therapies is unknown. Furthermore, the Lands cycle acyl-transferases that catalyze their formation are unidentified. eoxPL were measured in platelets and leukocytes from an atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) cohort and retrieved human arterial thrombi from three anatomical sites. The impact of age, gender, and aspirin was characterized in platelets from healthy subjects administered low-dose aspirin. The role of lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3 (LPCAT3) in eoxPL biosynthesis was tested using an inhibitor and a cell-free assay. Platelets from ASCVD patients generated lower levels of COX-derived eoxPL but elevated 12-LOX-diacyl forms, than platelets from healthy controls. This associated with aspirin and was recapitulated in healthy subjects by aspirin supplementation. P2Y12 inhibition had no impact on eoxPL. LPCAT3 inhibition selectively prevented 12-LOX-derived diacyl-eoxPL generation. LPCAT3 activity was not directly altered by aspirin. P2Y12 inhibition or aspirin had little impact on eoxPL in leukocytes. Complex aspirin-dependent gender and seasonal effects on platelet eoxPL generation were seen in healthy subjects. Limb or coronary (ST-elevation myocardial infarction, STEMI) thrombi displayed a platelet eoxPL signature while carotid thrombi had a white cell profile. EoxPL are altered in ASCVD by a commonly used cardiovascular therapy, and LPCAT3 was identified as the acyltransferase generating aspirin-sensitive 12-LOX diacyl forms.

39195314,Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance and Associated Cardiovascular Outcomes in a Hospital Setting-A Fresh Perspective.,"There is a paucity of data on the cardiovascular implications of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, especially among hospitalized patients. Our study aimed to investigate the association between MGUS and cardiovascular outcomes in a hospital setting using the National Inpatient Sample database. MGUS patients were sampled using ICD-10 codes. The patients were stratified into two cohorts based on the presence or absence of MGUS. Comorbidities and cardiovascular outcomes were collected using ICD 10 DM codes. CV outcomes were evaluated before and after 1:1 matching for age, gender, and race. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis was performed on the matched population, which excluded patients with diabetes mellitus, prior myocardial infarction, chronic kidney disease (stages 3-5), dialysis, hypertension, obesity, metabolic syndrome, cancer, antiplatelets, and oral anticoagulant use and was adjusted for smoking, dyslipidemia, and aspirin use to evaluate the cardiovascular outcomes. MGUS patients had more heart failure, atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolism, aortic aneurysm, aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, mitral stenosis, mitral regurgitation, conduction disorder, cor pulmonale, peripheral vascular disease, and acute myocardial infarction. After matching, MGUS was associated with heart failure, atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolism, aortic stenosis, mitral regurgitation, conduction disorder, cor pulmonale, and peripheral vascular disease. MGUS was linked to a wide spectrum of cardiovascular diseases in an inpatient setting. Further studies are needed to formulate appropriate recommendations for the screening and management of cardiovascular complications in individuals with MGUS.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2024,Curr Oncol,Mustafa Ahmad; Wei Chapman; Araji Ghada; Niazi Muhammad Rafay Khan; Grovu Radu; Weinberg Mitchell; Lafferty James,"Department of Cardiology, Northwell Health/Staten Island University Hospital, Staten Island, New York, NY 10305, USA.; Department of Internal Medicine, Northwell Health/Staten Island University Hospital, Staten Island, New York, NY 10305, USA.; Department of Internal Medicine, Northwell Health/Staten Island University Hospital, Staten Island, New York, NY 10305, USA.; Department of Hematology and Oncology, Northwell Health/Staten Island University Hospital, Staten Island, New York, NY 10305, USA.; Department of Internal Medicine, Northwell Health/Staten Island University Hospital, Staten Island, New York, NY 10305, USA.; Department of Cardiology, Northwell Health/Staten Island University Hospital, Staten Island, New York, NY 10305, USA.; Department of Cardiology, Northwell Health/Staten Island University Hospital, Staten Island, New York, NY 10305, USA.",10.3390/curroncol31080331,PMC11352401,N/A

39092852,Dual vs triple antithrombotic therapy in atrial fibrillation and acute coronary syndrome: An updated meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Antithrombotic treatment in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and acute coronary syndrome (ACS) poses a dilemma. We compared outcomes of dual antithrombotic therapy (DAT) (direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)/warfarin + antiplatelets) vs triple antithrombotic therapy (TAT) (DOACs/warfarin, aspirin, and P2Y12 inhibitor) in this population. Multiple databases were searched from inception to December 17, 2023 to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing DAT vs TAT in patients with AF and ACS. Outcomes included major adverse cardiac events (MACE), bleeding events, stroke, stent thrombosis, and myocardial infarction (MI). Relative risk and 95% confidence intervals were estimated with a random-effects model using the inverse-variance technique. We assigned <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> > 50% as an indicator of statistical heterogeneity. <i>p</i>-Value <0.05 was considered significant. Ten RCTs comprising 6186 patients on TAT (female 26%, mean age 71 ± 9 years) and 6800 patients on DAT (female 27%, mean age 71 ± 9 years) were included. Patients receiving DAT experienced lower rates of bleeding events compared to those receiving TAT, with relative risks of 0.69 [0.55-0.87] (<i>p</i> < 0.001), 0.65 [0.40-1.06] (<i>p</i> = 0.09), and 0.62 [0.46-0.84] (<i>p</i> < 0.001) for TAT durations of 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively. No difference was seen in the occurrence of MACE, MI, stroke, or stent thrombosis between DAT and TAT across all three durations of TAT. This is the largest pooled analysis comparing TAT to DAT stratified by the duration of antithrombotic therapy. Our results revealed that DAT was associated with reduced bleeding risk despite no difference in other outcomes.",Journal of investigative medicine : the official publication of the American Federation for Clinical Research,2024,J Investig Med,Sainbayar Enkhtsogt; Pham Hoang Nhat; Olson April; Ibrahim Ramzi; Grewal Harneet; Salih Mohammed; Mamas Mamas A; Lee Kwan,"Department of Medicine, UA College of Medicine, University of Arizona Tucson, Tucson, AZ, USA.; Department of Medicine, UA College of Medicine, University of Arizona Tucson, Tucson, AZ, USA.; Department of Medicine, UA College of Medicine, University of Arizona Tucson, Tucson, AZ, USA.; Department of Medicine, UA College of Medicine, University of Arizona Tucson, Tucson, AZ, USA.; Department of Medicine, Abrazo Health Network, Glendale, AZ, USA.; Heart Hospital-Baylor University Medical Center, Plano, TX, USA.; Keele Cardiovascular Research Group, Keele University, Keele, UK.; Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Phoenix, AZ, USA.",10.1177/10815589241270640,,N/A

38914608,Low platelet count at admission has an adverse impact on outcome in patients with acute coronary syndromes: from the START Antiplatelet registry.,"Some previous observations suggest that a low platelet count is associated with an increased risk of adverse outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). However, most of the data come from post-hoc analyses of randomized controlled trials and from studies including thrombocytopenia developed during hospital stay. Our aim was to assess the impact of low platelet count at admission on cardiovascular outcomes and treatment approach in patients hospitalized for ACS in a current real-life setting in Italy. Patients admitted to Italian coronary care units for ACS were enrolled in the START-ANTIPLATELET registry. Baseline clinical characteristics and treatment at discharge were recorded. Patients were followed-up at 6 months, 1 year and yearly thereafter. Low platelet count was defined as a count at admission < 150 > 100 k/µl or < 100 k/µL. Among 1894 enrolled patients, 157 (8.3%) had a platelet count < 150 > 100 k/µl and 30 (1.6%) < 100 k/µl. The median follow-up was 12.3 months (0.4-50.1). patients with low platelets were older (72 ± 10.4 vs 66 ± 12.4 years, p = 0.006), more frequently males (82.9 vs 72.1%, p = 0.001), hypertensive (90.0% vs 70.4%, p = 0.03), with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) (17.1 vs 8.6%, p = 0.02), and peripheral arterial disease (11.5 vs 6.2% p = 0.01) and/or had a previous myocardial infarction (40 vs 18.7%, p = 0.008) and/or a PCI (14.6 vs 7.8%, p = 0.001) than patients with normal platelets. A slightly, but significantly, lower percentage of thrombocytopenic patients were treated with primary PCI (78.1 vs 84.4%, p = 0.04) and they were more frequently discharged on aspirin plus clopidogrel rather than aspirin plus newer P2Y<sub>12</sub> antagonists (51.9 vs 65.4%, p = 0.01). MACE-free survival was significantly shorter in thrombocytopenic patients compared to patients with normal platelets (< 150 > 100 k/µl: 37.6 vs 41.8 months, p = 0.002; HR = 2.7, 95% CIs 1.4-5.2; < 100 k/µl: 31.7 vs 41.8 months, p = 0.01; HR = 6.5, 95% CIs 1.5-29.1). At multivariate analysis, low platelet count, age at enrollment, low glomerular filtration rate, low ejection fraction, a previous ischemic stroke and NVAF were independent predictors of MACE. A low platelet count at admission identifies a subgroup of ACS patients with a significantly increased risk of MACE and these patients should be managed with special care to prevent excess adverse outcomes.",Scientific reports,2024,Sci Rep,Gresele Paolo; Guglielmini Giuseppe; Del Pinto Maurizio; Calabrò Paolo; Pignatelli Pasquale; Patti Giuseppe; Pengo Vittorio; Antonucci Emilia; Cirillo Plinio; Fierro Tiziana; Palareti Gualtiero; Marcucci Rossella,"Department of Medicine and Surgery, Section of Internal and Cardiovascular Medicine, University of Perugia, Strada Vicinale Via Delle Corse, S.

38576674,Kawasaki Disease in a Young Adult: A Case Report and a Review of the Literature.,"This case report describes a 21-year-old female who was diagnosed with Kawasaki disease (KD), a rare condition in adults. Careful clinical assessment, including the history of a recent upper respiratory tract infection and the physical findings of fever, sinus tachycardia, strawberry tongue, and skin peeling of the hands and feet, prompted further evaluation. Laboratory findings supported an inflammatory process, and multidisciplinary consultations led to the diagnosis of KD. Prompt treatment with acetylsalicylic acid and intravenous immunoglobulin resulted in rapid improvement and prevention of the severe complications associated with untreated KD, particularly in the cardiovascular system. This case emphasizes the importance of the high risk of suspicion and the need for a comprehensive evaluation in atypical presentations of KD in adults, where early recognition and management are crucial to prevent long-term sequelae such as coronary artery aneurysms and myocardial infarction.",Cureus,2024,Cureus,Stojanovic Nikola; Ebubechukwu Ugochukwu J; Schaible Michael; Gorantla Asher; Bukharovich Inna,"Internal Medicine, Brookdale University Hospital Medical Center, Brooklyn, USA.; Internal Medicine, SUNY (State University of New York) Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, USA.; Internal Medicine, SUNY (State University of New York) Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, USA.; Cardiology, SUNY (State University of New York) Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, USA.; Cardiology, Kings County Hospital Center, Brooklyn, USA.",10.7759/cureus.55547,PMC10993638,N/A
38533994,Mobile phone text messaging for medication adherence in secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease.,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally, accounting for almost 18 million deaths annually. People with CVDs have a five times greater chance of suffering a recurrent cardiovascular event than people without known CVDs. Although drug interventions have been shown to be cost-effective in reducing the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events, adherence to medication remains suboptimal. As a scalable and cost-effective approach, mobile phone text messaging presents an opportunity to convey health information, deliver electronic reminders, and encourage behaviour change. However, it is uncertain whether text messaging can improve medication adherence and clinical outcomes.

38413716,Antiplatelet therapy prior to COVID-19 infection impacts on patients mortality: a propensity score-matched cohort study.,"One of the major pathomechanisms of COVID-19 is the interplay of hyperinflammation and disruptions in coagulation processes, involving thrombocytes. Antiplatelet therapy (AP) by anti-inflammatory effect and inhibition of platelet aggregation may affect these pathways. The aim of this study was to investigate if AP has an impact on the in-hospital course and medium-term outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The study population (2170 COVID-19 patients: mean ± SD age 60 ± 19 years old, 50% male) was divided into a group of 274 patients receiving any AP prior to COVID-19 infection (AP group), and after propensity score matching, a group of 274 patients without previous AP (non-AP group). Patients from the AP group were less frequently hospitalized in the intensive care unit: 9% vs. 15%, 0.55 (0.33-0.94), developed less often shock: 9% vs. 15%, 0.56 (0.33-0.96), and required less aggressive forms of therapy. The AP group had more coronary revascularizations: 5% vs. 1%, 3.48 (2.19-5.55) and strokes/TIA: 5% vs. 1%, 3.63 (1.18-11.2). The bleeding rate was comparable: 7% vs. 7%, 1.06 (0.54-2.06). The patients from the AP group had lower 3-month mortality: 31% vs. 39%, 0.69 (0.51-0.93) and didn't differ significantly in 6-month mortality: 34% vs. 41%, 0.79 (0.60-1.04). When analyzing the subgroup with a history of myocardial infarction and/or coronary revascularization and/or previous stroke/transient ischemic attack and/or peripheral artery disease, AP had a beneficial effect on both 3-month: 37% vs. 56%, 0.58 (0.40-0.86) and 6-month mortality: 42% vs. 57%, 0.63 (0.44-0.92). Moreover, the favourable effect was highly noticeable in this subgroup where acetylsalicylic acid was continued during hospitalization with reduction of in-hospital: 19% vs. 43%, 0.31 (0.15-0.67), 3-month: 30% vs. 54%, 044 (0.26-0.75) and 6-month mortality: 33% vs. 54%, 0.49 (0.29-0.82) when confronted with the subgroup who had acetylsalicylic acid suspension during hospitalization. The AP may have a beneficial impact on hospital course and mortality in COVID-19 and shouldn't be discontinued, especially in high-risk patients.",Scientific reports,2024,Sci Rep,Sokolski Mateusz; Reszka Konrad; Adamik Barbara; Kilis-Pstrusinska Katarzyna; Lis Weronika; Pomorski Michał; Sokolowski Janusz; Doroszko Adrian; Madziarska Katarzyna; Jankowska Ewa Anita; Protasiewicz Marcin,"Institute of Heart Disease, Wroclaw Medical University, Borowska 213, 50-556, Wroclaw, Poland. mateusz.sokolski@umw.edu.pl.; Institute of Heart Disease, University Hospital, Wroclaw, Poland.; Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Therapy, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.; Clinical Department of Pediatric Nephrology, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.; Institute of Heart Disease, University Hospital, Wroclaw, Poland.; Clinical Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.; Clinical Department of Emergency Medicine, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.; Clinical Department of Internal and Occupational Diseases, Hypertension and Clinical Oncology, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.; Department of Nephrology and Transplantation Medicine, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.; Institute of Heart Disease, Wroclaw Medical University, Borowska 213, 50-556, Wroclaw, Poland.; Institute of Heart Disease, Wroclaw Medical University, Borowska 213, 50-556, Wroclaw, Poland.",10.1038/s41598-024-55407-9,PMC10899234,N/A
