40627856,Ligation of the Pancreatic Stump With Quantified Force During Distal Pancreatectomy for Postoperative Pancreatic Fistula: Protocol for a Single-Center Nonrandomized Controlled Clinical Study.,"The incidence of postoperative pancreatic fistula following distal pancreatectomy is as high as 30%-50%. Postoperative pancreatic fistula can be a major cause of perioperative morbidity, resulting in prolonged hospital stays and increased health care costs. The management of the pancreatic stump is one of the key factors influencing the occurrence of postoperative pancreatic fistula after distal pancreatectomy, but the optimal management approach remains debatable. The main methods for pancreatic stump closure include manual suturing and stapler closure. However, both methods are associated with a high risk of postoperative pancreatic fistula, which may be related to the balance between providing sufficient pancreatic duct burst pressure and ensuring blood supply to the stump. Ligation of the pancreatic stump has been attempted to reduce the risk of postoperative pancreatic fistula following distal pancreatectomy, but its efficacy remains limited by the challenge of achieving the optimal ligation force.",JMIR research protocols,2025,JMIR Res Protoc,Chang Lufeng; Xiong Jiongxin; Yang Ming; Yang Yuxin; Peng Tao; Yin Tao; Wu Heshui; Gou Shanmiao,"Department of Pancreatic Surgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.; Department of Pancreatic Surgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.; Department of Pancreatic Surgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.; Department of Pancreatic Surgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.; Department of Pancreatic Surgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.; Department of Pancreatic Surgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.; Department of Pancreatic Surgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.; Department of Pancreatic Surgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.",10.2196/74018,,N/A

40627837,Exploring the Clinical Significance and Mechanistic Role of the LINC00487/hsa-miR-663b Axis in Cell Line Models of Acute Lung Injury.,"Acute lung injury (ALI) is a serious lung disease that tends to progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This study was aimed to seek new biomarkers of ALI to provide a basis for monitoring the progress of ALI in time. A human bronchial epithelial cell line (HBEC3-KT) was treated with 1 μg/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce the ALI response. The expression of LINC00487 and hsa-miR-663b in LPS-treated HBEC3-KT cells was detected by RT-qPCR. The regulation of hsa-miR-663b by LINC00487 was investigated using a dual luciferase assay and an over-expression experiment. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were detected by the CCK-8 assay and annexin V-FITC kit. Serum levels of LINC00487 and hsa-miR-663b were detected by collecting blood samples from ALI patients (with or without ARDS), and the ROC curve was constructed to assess their clinical value in ALI. LPS inhibited proliferation of HBEC3-KT cells and promoted their apoptosis and inflammatory response, which were further enhanced by LINC00487 over-expression and reversed by an hsa-miR-663b mimic. The hsa-miR-663b mimic weakened the luciferase activity of HBEC3-KT cells transfected with the luciferase vector of wild-type LINC00487. The cellular level of hsa-miR-663b was down-regulated by LINC00487 over-expression and increased by LINC00487 knockdown. The ROC curve showed that LINC00487 combined with hsa-miR-663b effectively diagnosed ALI (AUC = 0.840) and was a classifier for ALI patients with or without ARDS (AUC = 0.822). Serum LINC00487 and hsa-miR-663b levels are valuable biomarkers of ALI and can monitor the ALI progress. LINC00487 may promote ALI progression by negatively regulating hsa-miR-663b.",Folia biologica,2025,Folia Biol (Praha),Yan Xixiang; Xie Ziqi; Zheng Xiaoye; Xie Qing; Yang Junle; Wu Xiaojuan,"Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Affiliated Jianhu Hospital of Xinglin College, Nantong University, Nantong, China.; Department of Ultrasound Medicine, The Affiliated Hospital of Northwest University (Xi'an No.3 Hospital), Xi'an, China.; Department of Ultrasound Medicine, The Affiliated Hospital of Northwest University (Xi'an No.3 Hospital), Xi'an, China.; Department of Ultrasound Medicine, The Affiliated Hospital of Northwest University (Xi'an No.3 Hospital), Xi'an, China.; Department of Imaging Medicine, The Affiliated Hospital of Northwest University (Xi'an No.3 Hospital), Xi'an, China.; Department of Ultrasound Medicine, The Affiliated Hospital of Northwest University (Xi'an No.3 Hospital), Xi'an, China. xiaojuanwu8632@163.com.",10.14712/fb2025071020079,,N/A
40627835,miR-296-3p Controls Osteogenic Proliferation and Differentiation by Targeting ICAT and Is Involved in Fracture Healing.,"Fragility fractures have been a cause for concern because of their high incidence. For the prevention and treatment of osteoporotic fractures, it is important to understand how to promote bone formation and increase bone mass. This study investigated miR-296-3p expression and function in fragility fracture. The study enrolled 98 patients with hip fractures, 90 patients with wrist fractures and 35 healthy controls. RT-qPCR was used to detect the miR-296-3p level changes before and after surgery in fracture patients and during the differentiation of human bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). The starBase bioinformatics database was used for prediction of the miR-296-3p target gene, and dual luciferase report was used for verification of the target relationship. Our results demonstrated that miR-296-3p levels are up-regulated in fracture patients, while they gradually decrease during human BMSC differentiation. The up-regulation of miR-296-3p inhibited the proliferation and differentiation ability of human BMSCs, while inhibition of its expression had the opposite effects. miR-296-3p negatively regulates osteogenic differentiation, and over-expression of inhibitor of β-catenin and TCF (ICAT) could counteract the negative regulatory effect. miR-296-3p targets ICAT and affects the expression of key proteins in the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway. In conclusion, miR-296-3p can regulate the division and differentiation of osteoblasts by affecting the expression of ICAT and participate in fracture healing.",Folia biologica,2025,Folia Biol (Praha),Xu Feng; Huang Kun; Ji Wenjun; Huang Miao; Sima Jincheng; Li Jin; Song Hao; Xiong Wei; Tian Zhong,"Department of Orthopedics, The 943rd Hospital, Joint Logistic Support Force of Chinese People's Liberation Army, Wuwei, China.; Department of Emergency, Nantong Haimen District People's Hospital, Nantong, China.; Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University, Zunyi, China.; Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University, Zunyi, China.; Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University, Zunyi, China.; Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University, Zunyi, China.; Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University, Zunyi, China.; Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University, Zunyi, China. xiongwei9654@163.com.; Department of Orthopedics, Chonggang General Hospital, Chongqing, China. zhongtiandr1@163.com.",10.14712/fb2025071020064,,N/A

Lower face rejuvenation and jawline contouring procedures can help prevent or reduce these changes. Traditional approaches for lower face rejuvenation and jawline contouring include surgical facelifts; however, using less invasive procedures to achieve these outcomes is becoming increasingly popular. This article introduces the L-Lift, a novel technique for jawline contouring in Southeast Asians. The L-Lift involves administering sequential calcium hydroxylapatite injections along the lower border of the mandible and subzygomatic arch (lateral cheek) depression. We present three cases that demonstrate its efficacy and safety. In all cases, the L-Lift effectively improved jawline contour and reduced jowls. The patients were highly satisfied, and the results were still evident when they presented for their follow-up appointments. The L-Lift provides subtle rejuvenation, does not lead to an overly masculine appearance, and aligns with regional aesthetic preferences.

We divided the study patients into two groups based on the year they were treated (2020 = 791; 2021 = 1,037). We did not include any new patients in the study. We found that 2.5% (n = 19) of the patients in the 2020 group experienced a lack of treatment effect and 5.2% (n = 40) experienced a decrease in treatment duration. We found that 2.1% (n = 22) of the patients in the 2021 group experienced a lack of treatment effect and 13.6% (n = 141) experienced a decrease in treatment duration. We also identified a sample population of patients who experienced a decrease in treatment duration incidents when receiving the COVID-19 vaccine after their last treatment.

40627752,Association of Systolic Blood Pressure Time in Target Range With Cardiovascular Events Among PRECISION Participants.,"Blood pressure (BP) is a dynamic vital sign with variability. Novel metrics that account for BP variability and longitudinal control are gaining interest, such as time in target range (TTR) assessments. TTR is the percentage of time a patient's BP is within a desired range. We sought to determine if systolic BP TTR was associated with major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) among participants in the PRECISION (Prospective Randomized Evaluation of Celecoxib Integrated Safety versus Ibuprofen or Naproxen) trial. PRECISION was a 24 081-participant cardiovascular (CV) outcomes trial comparing celecoxib, naproxen, or ibuprofen in participants with increased CV risk. Systolic BP was in the target range if it was between 110 and 130 mm Hg. TTR was determined via traditional and Rosendaal linear interpolation (RLI) methods. Participants were categorized based on TTR achieved, <25%, 25%-<50%, 50%-<75%, or ≥75%. Hazard ratios (HR) and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated. Twenty thousand four hundred and eighty-seven participants had at least four BP readings available for analysis and a median follow-up of 27.6 ± 5.4 months. The cohort had a mean baseline BP of 125.2 mm Hg and a mean systolic BP of 127.5 mm Hg when accounting for all follow-up visits. A lower risk of MACE was observed among individuals with ≥75% TTR compared with those <25% using the traditional (adjusted HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.52-0.95, p = 0.02) and RLI method (adjusted HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.43-0.75, p < 0.001).

Traditional assessments of these systems are often expensive, limited to specialised settings or focus on overall balance outcomes, potentially overlooking deficits in the individual systems. This study aimed to evaluate the test-retest reliability of a novel, fully portable clinical assessment tool designed to provide objective measures for individual components of the VVS system and ANS function.MethodsTwenty-eight participants (aged 20-88 years), with no comorbidities and meeting Australian physical activity guidelines, completed the protocol twice. The novel clinical assessment tool comprised of two systems: (1) a virtual reality-type headset incorporating eye-tracking to evaluate visual-vestibular function (smooth pursuit and voluntary saccades), and autonomic function (pupil light reflex); and (2) the Active Movement Extent Discrimination Apparatus (AMEDA) for somatosensory function. Reliability was assessed using two-way mixed-effects model (consistency type, single rater) Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC 3,1) calculated in R-studio. The standard error of measurement (SEM) and minimal detectable change (MDC) was also calculated. Bland-Altman plots were utilised to visualise the agreement between two test repeats.ResultsEach metric demonstrated at least moderate to good test re-test reliability: left and right AMEDA (ICC = 0.69 and 0.75), smooth pursuit (ICC = 0.67), voluntary saccades (ICC = 0.53), autonomic response delay (ICC = 0.80), parasympathetic function (ICC = 0.86), and sympathetic function (ICC = 0.89).DiscussionThis study supports the reliability of a new, fully portable clinical assessment tool to assess VVS and ANS function. By demonstrating the reliability of this new streamlined tool for evaluating the VVS and ANS systems, the findings of this study has the potential to enhance clinical practice and research in falls prevention and balance rehabilitation.",Perceptual and motor skills,2025,Percept Mot Skills,McGrath Michaela; Waddington Gordon; Bissett Bernie; Fearon Angie; Witchalls Jeremy,"Research Institute for Sport and Exercise, Faculty of Health, University of Canberra, ACT, Australia.; Research Institute for Sport and Exercise, Faculty of Health, University of Canberra, ACT, Australia.; Clinical Research Rehabilitation and Translation Group, Faculty of Health, University of Canberra, Canberra, ACT, Australia.; Research Institute for Sport and Exercise, Faculty of Health, University of Canberra, ACT, Australia.; Research Institute for Sport and Exercise, Faculty of Health, University of Canberra, ACT, Australia.",10.1177/00315125251358318,,N/A

40627656,"Diagnostic accuracy of self-reported food consumption and shaking chills in predicting bacteremia in outpatients: A prospective, multicenter observational study.","Bacteremia, a critical condition that can lead to sepsis, is often diagnosed using blood cultures, which may yield false positives, leading to unnecessary treatments. Although clinical indicators, such as shaking chills and food consumption, have been identified as predictors of bacteremia, their diagnostic accuracy in outpatients, particularly when considering the timing of blood collection, remains unclear. This study aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of self-reported food consumption and shaking chills in detecting bacteremia, focusing on the time interval between the last meal and blood culture collection. This prospective, multicenter, observational study included outpatients aged > 16 years who could eat orally and underwent blood cultures in the emergency or general medicine department from April 2019 to March 2021. Food consumption before blood culture was self-reported using a medical questionnaire and categorized as ""normal"" (≥80%) or ""poor"" (<80%). The presence of chills was also assessed. Among 534 patients (mean age 68.3 ± 21.9 years, 51.3% men), 68 had bacteremia. The absence of poor food consumption (i.e., normal food consumption) had a negative predictive value of 91.2% (95% confidence interval, 88.8-93.6) and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.66 (0.23-1.94). Excluding the blood cultures collected between 10 pm and 8 am, these values increased to 96.2% (94.5-97.8) and 0.32 (0.12-0.89), respectively. Shaking chills had a positive likelihood ratio of 3.74 (2.75-4.73), increasing to 4.21 (3.22-5.19) after the same exclusion. Self-reported shaking chills were good positive predictors of bacteremia in outpatients, whereas self-reported normal food consumption, when accounting for the time between meals, ruled out bacteremia. These findings could help improve the early diagnosis and management of bacteremia, particularly in outpatient settings, and may contribute to the development of self-report tools for clinical decision-making.",PloS one,2025,PLoS One,Komatsu Takayuki; Inoue Kenji; Someya Yuki; Hirano Hiroshi; Saitoh Fumihiro; Aoki Makoto; Inui Akihiro; Tierney Lawrence M; Mishima Kentaro; Mizuno Keiko; Takami Hiroki; Nomura Tomohisa; Sugita Manabu,"Department of Emergency and Critical Care Medicine, Juntendo University Nerima Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Cardiovascular Biology and Medicine, Juntendo University Nerima Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Sports Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Juntendo University, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Surgery, Kouseikai Suzuki Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of General Medicine, Ooizumi Health Cooperative Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.; Infectious Disease Consultant, Japan.; Department of General Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Juntendo University, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Internal Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, United States of America.; Department of Emergency and Critical Care Medicine, Juntendo University Nerima Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Emergency and Critical Care Medicine, Juntendo University Nerima Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Emergency and Critical Care Medicine, Juntendo University Nerima Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Emergency and Critical Care Medicine, Juntendo University Nerima Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Emergency and Critical Care Medicine, Juntendo University Nerima Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.",10.1371/journal.pone.0327789,,N/A

40627620,Assessing self-selection biases in Facebook-recruited online surveys: Evidence from the COVID-19 Health Behavior Survey.,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, many primary data collection efforts relied on online surveys via social media recruitment. According to the leverage-salience theory, respondents' varying interest in the survey topic can lead to differential survey responses, potentially introducing biases. In this study, we investigate the potential impact of displaying the survey topic in the survey recruitment materials on survey responses. We use data from the ""COVID-19 Health Behavior Survey"", a cross-national online survey that we ran between March and August 2020 in eight countries in Europe and North America (N=120,184). Respondents were recruited via targeted advertisements placed on Facebook with varying degrees of reference to the survey topic of COVID-19. The aim of our study is to assess whether stronger (or weaker) topic salience in the ad images is associated with higher (or lower) threat perceptions of COVID-19 and the adoption of preventive behaviors, including face mask use and increased hand-washing. Regression analyses show that in 20 of the 32 models, ad images had no significant effect on the survey outcomes. Factors like the month of survey participation or respondents' age were more influential. In the remaining models, where unexplained image effects persisted, the impact was minimal. While mask-wearing images were generally associated with lower threat perceptions of COVID-19 to oneself and the family, we found no consistent pattern for the adoption of protective behaviors. Overall, our findings do not provide consistent evidence that higher topic salience in our Facebook-based recruitment materials systematically influenced survey responses. However, in specific countries, certain recruitment images were linked to variations in COVID-19 threat perception and uptake of preventive behaviors. These context-specific effects highlight the importance of careful recruitment design for Facebook-based surveys during health crises.",PloS one,2025,PLoS One,Donzowa Jessica; Perrotta Daniela; Zagheni Emilio,"Department of Digital and Computational Demography, Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research, Rostock, Mecklenburg Western Pomerania, Germany.; Department of Digital and Computational Demography, Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research, Rostock, Mecklenburg Western Pomerania, Germany.; Department of Digital and Computational Demography, Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research, Rostock, Mecklenburg Western Pomerania, Germany.",10.1371/journal.pone.0326884,,N/A

40627587,Photoprotection Efficacy of Sun Protection Factor and Iron Oxide Formulations in Diverse Skin With Melasma and Photodamage.,"Visible light (400-700nm) comprises 45% of the sunlight spectrum and can induce both immediate and persistent skin darkening, as well as worsen dyschromia, especially in the skin of color population. In a recent mini-zone study, we demonstrated that iron oxide (FeO)-containing formulations could protect skin from visible light-induced pigmentation in Fitzpatrick skin type (FST) IV individuals, while ultraviolet (UV) protection sunscreen SPF 50+ (sun protection factor) could not. To assess the benefit of adding FeO-containing foundation into real-life daily sun care routine in improving the appearance of photodamage and melasma, we evaluated the efficacy of two sun protection regimens (SPF50 alone and SPF50+FeO) in healthy women of FST III to VI for 12 weeks. Clinical evaluation and colorimetric measurement showed that both regimens significantly improved skin quality and overall appearance over 12 weeks compared to baseline. At week 4, the photodamage subgroup using SPF50+FeO showed early improvement over baseline in skin roughness (visual and tactile). The melasma subgroup using SPF50+FeO showed early improvement in overall healthy appearance. At week 12, although both groups showed improvement in colorimetric measurements (L*), the response was different: 36% of melasma participants in the SPF50+FeO group showed superior improvement in their skin radiance (L*) vs 0% in the SPF50 group. A self-assessment questionnaire revealed that SPF50+FeO enhanced the quality of life in participants with melasma. This study demonstrated the importance of including visible light protection into a daily sun care routine, especially for melasma: masking and improving existing conditions indoors and outdoors at the same time.

40627584,The Impact of Hyperpigmentation on the Lives of Patients.,"Hyperpigmentation is a prevalent condition that disproportionately impacts individuals with skin of color, diminishing their quality of life and psychosocial well-being. There is a need to better understand the experiences, motivations, and expectations of patients seeking hyperpigmentation treatment. A cross-sectional survey was performed to analyze the perspectives and experiences of patients with hyperpigmentation. While over half (51.37%) of participants view their hyperpigmentation as ""more bothersome than its initial cause,"" there is a notable lack of routine dermatological care and sunscreen use. Of the respondents, 40.67% had never tried any treatments and among those who have, 34.67% were dissatisfied with the results. Expectations for treatment outcome timeframes varied, with 37.06% expecting results within 1 to 4 weeks. Of the participants, 52.67% reported being ""not at all"" or only ""slightly"" informed about current treatment options and only 16.32% feel ""very"" or ""extremely"" satisfied with current treatments. If their hyperpigmentation was successfully treated, 43.33% of respondents anticipated a very positive impact on their self-esteem. The current study highlights a critical need for improved patient education and tailored treatment approaches in hyperpigmentation practices. Enhancing patient knowledge about treatment options and setting realistic expectations may bridge the gap between patient experiences and treatment outcomes.",Journal of drugs in dermatology : JDD,2025,J Drugs Dermatol,Wang Jennifer Y; Kabakova Margaret; Philip Raichel; Stolyar Julia; Berger-Gutierrez Rebecca; Jagdeo Jared,,10.36849/JDD.8519,,N/A
40627579,Poly-L-Lactic Acid (PLLA-SCA) as a Safe and Effective Method to Soften Transition Between Lower Eyelid and Midface.,"Worsening depression around the lower eyelid and midface are seen over time with age. Skin thinning, fat atrophy, along with pigmentation, skin texture, and shadow changes contribute to the ""tired"" look of the area. Current minimally invasive treatments approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) include hyaluronic acid injections, but these come with limitations, such as patient selection and potential risks of Tyndall effect and swelling, which are dependent on injection technique and product selection. However, poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA-SCA) may be an alternative treatment option as it regenerates the patient&rsquo;s own collagen and elastin and improves skin quality. The aim of this case series is to discuss the technique to improve maxilla/malar projection, pigmentation, texture, and volume after PLLA-SCA treatment. This is a case series where healthy adults with lower eyelid- midface deficiency due to congenital or age-related soft or hard tissue atrophy were injected with 2 to 2.5 mL of PLLA-SCA collagen activator (PLLA-SCA, Sculptra) per injection site diluted to 8 to 9 mL of sterile water for injection (SWFI) and 1 cc lidocaine 2%. Patients returned typically for 3 sessions every 6 weeks. Patients had improvement in maxilla/malar projection, pigmentation, texture, and volume. Clinical outcomes are seen as early as 6 weeks after last session (3 sessions average) with minimal to no touchup required 4 to 5 years post-initial treatment. No unanticipated adverse events were noted. PLLA-SCA is a safe and possibly long-term effective treatment option for patients who require softening of the lower eyelid and midface transition.",Journal of drugs in dermatology : JDD,2025,J Drugs Dermatol,Montes Jose R; Rohrich Rod J; Meckfessel Matthew H; Le Jennifer H T D,,10.36849/JDD.9003,,N/A

In addition to uncomfortable signs and symptoms, dry skin can be associated with pigmentary changes in individuals with darker skin types. This small single-center study applied a split-body methodology to compare the hydrating effects of a gentle moisturizing lotion vs a gentle moisturizing cream on arms over a 4-week period. Corneometry and digital photography were used to compare changes in skin hydration, and heatmaps were generated to visualize changes and augment the visible results seen in photography. Both the lotion and cream effectively achieved a rapid and sustained improvement in skin hydration.

40627573,Pincer Nail Deformity in an African American Patient Corrected by Fractionated Carbon Dioxide Laser.,"Pincer nail deformity is a painful nail condition characterized by excessive transverse curvature of the nail plate that pinches the surrounding tissue. Treatments such as nail braces and surgical interventions are commonly used, however, these approaches often fall short of providing consistent, long-term relief. Fractionated carbon dioxide laser therapy (fCO2), which precisely targets the nail matrix, has emerged as a less invasive option to correct nail deformities. Treating patients with skin of color poses several challenges due to the higher risk of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) and scarring. Herein, we describe a case of a 78-year-old African American woman (Fitzpatrick V) with long-standing pincer nail deformity treated with fCO2 laser therapy, with nail defect improvement. This case underscores fCO2 laser therapy as an effective option for pincer nail deformity in skin of color, particularly notable due to its rare occurrence in the fingernails.",Journal of drugs in dermatology : JDD,2025,J Drugs Dermatol,Collins Alexia; Kabakova Margaret; Zafar Kayla; Baroud Sumer; Glick Sharon; Jagdeo Jared,,10.36849/JDD.8783,,N/A
40627552,Exploring Clinicians' and Patients' Acceptance and Utilization of a Digital Solution to Support Individualized Care in Diabetes Specialist Outpatient Care (DigiDiaS): Qualitative Study.,"With the increasing prevalence of type 1 diabetes alongside limited health care resources, the need for more sustainable health care services is apparent. Central to ensuring the standard of diabetes care while simultaneously optimizing resource utilization is improved patient-clinician communication and the provision of individualized care. Digital outpatient solutions incorporating patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) have been introduced in diabetes outpatient care over recent years; however, features and delivery methods differ, and existing studies on their use and perceived clinical value are limited. Furthermore, clinicians' acceptance has been suggested as a key factor in the sustainability of digital solutions. Thus, to support the implementation of digital outpatient solutions perceived as valuable by clinicians and patients, we need more knowledge about how they are accepted and utilized in clinical practice.",JMIR human factors,2025,JMIR Hum Factors,Mollestad Maria Aadland; Jensen Annesofie Lunde; Holmen Heidi; Singstad Tone; Årsand Eirik; Winther Jacob Andreas; Torbjørnsen Astrid,"Department of Nursing and Health Promotion, Faculty of Health Sciences, OsloMet-Oslo Metropolitan University, Postboks 4, St Olavs plass, Oslo, 0130, Norway, +4767235266.; SDCA-Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.; Department of Nursing and Health Promotion, Faculty of Health Sciences, OsloMet-Oslo Metropolitan University, Postboks 4, St Olavs plass, Oslo, 0130, Norway, +4767235266.; Division of Medicine, Akershus University Hospital, Lillestrøm, Norway.; Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Science and Technology, UiT The Arctic University of Norway, Tromsø, Norway.; Division of Medicine, Akershus University Hospital, Lillestrøm, Norway.; Department of Nursing and Health Promotion, Faculty of Health Sciences, OsloMet-Oslo Metropolitan University, Postboks 4, St Olavs plass, Oslo, 0130, Norway, +4767235266.",10.2196/70301,,N/A

The first case in Taiwan was identified on February 25, 2003, and the final case was reported on June 15, 2003. During the epidemic, 346 people were diagnosed with SARS, leading to 37 deaths. Outbreaks also occurred in China, Singapore, and Toronto (Canada), showing the vulnerability of global health systems to new zoonotic diseases. Clinically, SARS causes high fever and severe lung inflammation. Survivors often had long-term lung problems, including fibrosis, and bone issues like osteonecrosis, mostly due to high-dose steroid treatment. Although studies have looked at long-term outcomes-especially lung and bone issues-none followed patients beyond 7 years.
