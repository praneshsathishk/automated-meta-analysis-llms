40632640,Why colchicine is not beneficial in patients with acute coronary syndrome? In search of a CLEAR answer.,"Neutrophil count is a risk factor for myocardial infarction (MI). Colchicine, a drug known as an anti-inflammatory, acts by selectively concentrating on neutrophils and impairing their function. Colchicine has been used successfully in the prevention of vascular events in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), but recently the largest clinical trial carried out with colchicine in this clinical setting was unexpectedly neutral in the comparison of placebo and colchicine in patients with recent MI. Among the characteristics that distinguish patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) from established CAD is the dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), often consisting of aspirin and clopidogrel. Clopidogrel significantly reduces neutrophil count and could play a competitive role with colchicine by blunting its clinical effect.",Coronary artery disease,2025,Coron Artery Dis,De Servi Stefano; Molteni Mauro; Cimminiello Claudio,"Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Pavia, Pavia.; Medical Department, Tradate Hospital, Azienda Ospedaliera di Varese, Azienda Socio Sanitaria dei Sette Laghi, Tradate.; Arianna Foundation on Anticoagulation, Bologna, Italy.",10.1097/MCA.0000000000001551,,N/A

40605381,Impact of Intravenous Nitrate Treatment on Antiplatelet Effects of Clopidogrel in Acute Coronary Syndrome Patients: A Pilot Study.,"BackgroundClopidogrel is a pro-drug that requires metabolic activation by hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes in two steps. Previous studies have shown that the administration of continuous nitrate significantly affects the activity of hepatic CYP. In this pilot study, we assess the impact of intravenous nitrate treatment on the antiplatelet effects of clopidogrel in patients with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).MethodWe included 20 NSTEMI patients: 15 in the nitrate group and five in the control group. All patients received a 300 mg acetylsalicylic acid and a 600 mg clopidogrel loading dose. The nitrate group was administered an intravenous glyceryl trinitrate infusion at 10 µg/min for 48 h. After the drugs were initiated, blood samples were collected from patients at intervals of 30th minutes, 60th minutes, 120th minutes, fourth hour, sixth hour, and 48th hour to assess platelet function. The antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel was evaluated using the platelet reactivity unit (PRU) from the Verify-Now P2Y12 assay.ResultThe PRU values at baseline and the 30th, 60th, 120th minutes, and 48th hour were similar between the two groups (<i>P</i> > .05). However, PRU values at the fourth and sixth hours were significantly higher in the nitrate group than in the control group (274.1 ± 53.9 vs 162.4 ± 39.9; <i>P</i> = .002 and 272.0 ± 67.0 vs 185.6 ± 18.1; <i>P</i> = .03, respectively).ConclusionIntravenous nitrate therapy in patients with NSTEMI delayed the onset of the antiplatelet effect of orally loaded clopidogrel by at least 4 h. This point should be kept in mind in patients using clopidogrel and nitrate therapy together.

40569059,"Peripheral Artery Disease and Antithrombotic Management: A Global Perspective on Efficacy, Safety, and Access.","Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a severe manifestation of systemic atherosclerosis, affecting over 230 million individuals worldwide and leading to both limb-threatening ischemia and catastrophic cardiovascular events. This progression is driven in part by thrombosis, which arises from complex interactions of endothelial dysfunction, platelet activation, and thrombin generation. These processes culminate in acute limb ischemia, major amputations, and myocardial infarction. Antithrombotic therapy is fundamental to PAD management, with antiplatelet monotherapy (aspirin or clopidogrel) remaining first-line for symptomatic patients. However, the paradigm has shifted with dual-pathway inhibition (DPI), combining low-dose rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice daily) with aspirin, which reduces major adverse cardiovascular events by 24% and limb events by 46%, particularly in high-risk subgroups including postrevascularization or chronic limb-threatening ischemia patients. Despite these advances, bleeding risks (eg, gastrointestinal hemorrhage with DPI) and global disparities in access to therapies pose significant challenges. Current guidelines now stratify recommendations by risk: the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology endorses DPI for postrevascularization (class IIa), while the European Society of Cardiology reserves it for recurrent ischemia (class IIb). Emerging strategies target residual inflammatory risk (eg, colchicine) and vascular regeneration (stem cell therapy), yet cost and scalability limit widespread adoption, especially in developing nations bearing 70% of the PAD burden. The future of PAD care demands personalized approaches that integrate antithrombotic efficacy, bleeding mitigation, and socioeconomic realities. Further research is needed to refine risk stratification, expand access to DPI, and develop adjunctive therapies for this growing global health crisis.",Cardiology in review,2025,Cardiol Rev,Mohammadi Abbas; Vaseghi Yasaman; Rafatnia Ali; Mohammadi Somayeh; Frishman William H; Aronow Wilbert S,"From the Department of Medicine, Valley Health System, Las Vegas, NV.; From the Department of Medicine, Valley Health System, Las Vegas, NV.; From the Department of Medicine, Valley Health System, Las Vegas, NV.; Department of Anesthesia and Critical Care, University of Chicago, IL.; Department of Medicine, New York Medical College, Valhalla, NY.; Departments of Cardiology and Medicine, Westchester Medical Center and New York Medical College, Valhalla, NY.",10.1097/CRD.0000000000000989,,N/A

40404853,Ecofriendly first-derivative synchronous fluorometric method for simultaneous determination of atorvastatin and aspirin in pharmaceutical preparations.,"The combination of atorvastatin (ATO) and aspirin (ASP) is widely prescribed for preventing cardiovascular diseases, particularly in individuals at risk of atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction. This study aims to develop and validate an eco-friendly spectrofluorimetric method using the first-derivative synchronous fluorescence (FDSSF) technique (Δλ = 80 nm) to simultaneously determine ATO and ASP in combined pharmaceutical formulations. A simple, rapid, cost-effective, and interference-free FDSSF method was employed. Ethanol was used as a green solvent, with a scanning rate of 500 nm/min and Δλ of 80 nm. Distinct fluorescence peaks for ATO and ASP were observed at 384 nm and 365 nm, respectively. The method was optimized for parameters influencing fluorescence intensity, ensuring enhanced sensitivity and selectivity. The method demonstrated excellent linearity (0.4-6 μg/ml for ATO, 1-10 μg/ml for ASP) with high sensitivity, as indicated by low LOD (0.03 μg/ml for ATO, 0.342 μg/ml for ASP) and LOQ (0.248 μg/ml for ATO, 0.714 μg/ml for ASP). The method was successfully applied to commercial tablet formulations and synthetic mixtures, yielding results comparable to HPLC, confirming its high accuracy and reproducibility. Environmental Assessment: The method was evaluated for ""greenness"" (AGREE, Complex MOGAPI, NEMI), ""whiteness"" (RGB12), and ""blueness"" (BAGI), achieving high sustainability scores. The results confirmed its minimal environmental impact and eco-friendly nature. The FDSSF method provides a green, accurate, and reliable approach for simultaneously determining ATO and ASP in pharmaceuticals, offering high sensitivity, exceptional selectivity, and environmental sustainability.",Scientific reports,2025,Sci Rep,Abuseada Hamed H M; Abdel Sattar Osama I; Madkour Ahmed W; Taha Ahmed S,"Pharmaceutical Analytical Chemistry Department, Faculty of Pharmacy, Al-Azhar University, Cairo, 11751, Egypt.; Pharmaceutical Analytical Chemistry Department, Faculty of Pharmacy, Al-Azhar University, Cairo, 11751, Egypt.; Pharmaceutical Analytical Chemistry Department, Faculty of Pharmacy, Al-Azhar University, Cairo, 11751, Egypt.; Pharmaceutical Analytical Chemistry Department, Faculty of Pharmacy, Al-Azhar University, Cairo, 11751, Egypt. ahmedsobhytaha@gmail.com.",10.1038/s41598-025-99718-x,PMC12098671,N/A

40190953,Synchronous Acute Ischemic Stroke and Acute Myocardial Infarction: A Case Report.,"The synchronous presentation of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and acute myocardial infarction (AMI), termed concurrent cardiocerebral infarction (CCI), is a rare but fatal condition that poses challenges in diagnosis and management. This case report contributes to the limited literature on the successful management of a patient presenting with CCI while emphasizing the risk-benefit balance in thrombolysis and dual antiplatelet therapy. We report a 51-year-old male who presented to the emergency department with a stroke alert after experiencing right-sided flaccid paralysis and aphasia. National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score on arrival was 24. An initial CT angiogram of the head confirmed the presence of an occluded left internal carotid artery (ICA) terminus with no flow in the left middle cerebral artery (MCA). Tenecteplase 0.25mg/kg was administered, and the patient subsequently underwent thrombectomy. An EKG after undergoing thrombectomy revealed ST elevations in the anteroseptal leads V1-V4. After the thrombectomy, the patient was transferred to a facility with interventional cardiology, where he underwent percutaneous coronary aspiration thrombectomy with drug-eluting stent placement into the proximal and mid-left anterior descending artery. The patient received 300mg rectal aspirin and IV cangrelor. He was continued on aspirin/clopidogrel dual therapy, and the patient was subsequently discharged and instructed to follow up with a cardiologist. This case report underscores the necessity of a holistic approach to management guidelines for patients presenting with synchronous AIS and AMI due to the potential complications associated with the treatment of either AIS or AMI.",Cureus,2025,Cureus,Grela Ivan; Peterson Thomas R,"Emergency Medicine, Florida Atlantic University Charles E.

40167885,Acute myocardial infarction in patients with cancer: outcomes and P2Y12 inhibition.,"Cancer patients are at an elevated risk of bleeding and ischemic events. There are limited comparative real-world data on outcomes of all-comer cancer patients after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) compared with non-cancer patients. There are also limited comparative data to guide P2Y12 inhibitor choice in cancer patients undergoing PCI. We queried the TriNetX research database from 2015 to 2023 to identify adult patients who received PCI for AMI. AMI patients were then stratified into cancer and non-cancer patients. Propensity score matching was used to account for imbalances in baseline characteristics. Cancer patients were further categorized into those who received dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with ticagrelor or clopidogrel in addition to aspirin. Outcomes of interest included all-cause mortality and major bleeding at 30-days and 1-year. Of 139,342 patients who underwent PCI for AMI, 6,766 (4.9%) had a history of cancer. Compared with AMI patients without cancer, cancer patients had higher 1-year all-cause mortality (20.1% vs. 12.7%; HR 1.59; 95% CI, 1.46-1.73) and major bleeding (16.9% vs. 10.2%; HR 1.69; 95% CI 1.54-1.86). Among cancer patients with AMI, those treated with ticagrelor-based DAPT after PCI had similar incidence of bleeding complications compared with those treated with clopidogrel (HR 1.04; 95% CI 0.77-1.40). Cancer is an adverse prognostic marker for AMI outcomes and is independently associated with substantially higher mortality and bleeding risk. Among cancer patients undergoing PCI for AMI, ticagrelor use is associated with similar bleeding events compared with clopidogrel.",Journal of thrombosis and thrombolysis,2025,J Thromb Thrombolysis,Cordova Sanchez Andres; Holmes Chris E; Dauerman Harold L; Gupta Tanush,"Division of Cardiology, University of Vermont Medical Center, Burlington, VT, USA.; Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Vermont Medical Center, Burlington, VT, USA.; Division of Cardiology, University of Vermont Medical Center, Burlington, VT, USA.; Division of Cardiology, University of Vermont Medical Center, Burlington, VT, USA.

40137405,Association of Aspirin Use in Primary Prevention and Cardiovascular Events: A Retrospective Analysis of the VITAL Cohort.,"<b>Background:</b> Aspirin is part of the therapeutic antithrombotic armamentarium for the management of patients with established clinically relevant atherosclerosis or thrombotic cardiovascular disease. Personalized medicine identifies those who benefit most or face fewer risks from aspirin. The role of aspirin in primary prevention is still debatable. We aimed to assess the risks and benefits of aspirin in this setting, using the data of the prospective VITAL (VITamins and Lifestyle) study. <b>Methods:</b> We conducted a retrospective evaluation of the VITAL cohort. In this analysis, participants were split according to aspirin usage. Aspirin use was evaluated regarding all-cause mortality, CV mortality, major cardiovascular event (MACE), myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease, total stroke, and hemorrhagic stroke. The hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated to explore the association between cardiovascular events and aspirin usage. The estimates were adjusted for demographic and clinical variables. <b>Results:</b> The aspirin users (<i>n</i> = 11,570) were older, more frequently men, the body mass index was higher, and the proportion of smokers was smaller compared with non-users (<i>n</i> = 13,927). After adjusting for demographic and clinical variables, aspirin was not identified as a predictor of cardiovascular death (HR 1.17, 95%CI 0.89 to 1.55), major cardiovascular events (HR 1.04, 95%CI 0.89 to 1.22), coronary heart disease (HR 1.16, 95%CI 0.98 to 1.37), nor stroke (HR 1.01, 95%CI 0.77 to 1.31). <b>Conclusion:</b> In this retrospective analysis of the VITAL cohort, aspirin was not associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular mortality or events.",Journal of personalized medicine,2025,J Pers Med,Caldeira Daniel; Alves Mariana; Gonçalves Nilza; Costa João; Ferreira Joaquim J; Pinto Fausto J,"Centro Cardiovascular da Universidade de Lisboa-CCUL@RISE, Centro Académico de Medicina de Lisboa (CAML), Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Lisboa, 1649-028 Lisbon, Portugal.; Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Lisboa, 1649-029 Lisbon, Portugal.; Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Lisboa, 1649-029 Lisbon, Portugal.; Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Lisboa, 1649-029 Lisbon, Portugal.; Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Lisboa, 1649-029 Lisbon, Portugal.; Centro Cardiovascular da Universidade de Lisboa-CCUL@RISE, Centro Académico de Medicina de Lisboa (CAML), Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Lisboa, 1649-028 Lisbon, Portugal.",10.3390/jpm15030089,PMC11943274,N/A

40046649,The formation of cholesterol crystals and embolization during myocardial infarction.,"Cholesterol crystals (CCs) released into the coronary circulation during plaque rupture have multiple adverse impacts on both the arterial conduit as well as the myocardium. CCs form within the atheromatous plaque by the saturation of free cholesterol deposition via facilitated LDL-c entry because of a dysfunctional endothelium. Once formed, CCs are viewed as a foreign body and activate inflammation via the innate immune system. Eventually, an inflamed atheromatous plaque ruptures by virtue of the growth and expansion of CCs that begin to occupy a greater volume than the liquid phase cholesterol. In some instances, the sharp edges of CCs can puncture and tear the plaque's fibrous cap causing rupture leading to thrombosis and myocardial infarction. In these circumstances, CCs are released from the ruptured plaque and travel down the coronary artery where they can scrape the endothelial lining which enhances vasospastic activity, further worsening ischemia. Moreover, when CCs lodge in the distal arteriolar and capillary beds, they not only obstruct blood flow to further aggravate ischemia but also activate an inflammatory response in the myocardium that leads to further tissue injury. Treatment of CCs has thus far been limited but studies using statins, aspirin and colchicine have demonstrated them to be effective in dissolving CCs that may provide additional benefits for both prevention and potentially for acute cardiovascular events.",American heart journal plus : cardiology research and practice,2025,Am Heart J Plus,Mughal Jamal; Katkoori Venkat R; Nidorf Stefan Mark; Manu Megan; Abela George S,"Department of Medicine, Division of cardiology, Michigan State University, Lansing, MI, USA.; Department of Surgery, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA.; Heart and Cardiovascular Institute, Perkins Research Institute, Perth, WA, Australia.; College of Human Medicine, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA.; College of Human Medicine, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA.",10.1016/j.ahjo.2025.100509,PMC11881462,N/A
40046367,Evaluating Drug-Eluting Balloons Versus Stenting for Provisional Bifurcation Lesions: Short-Term Outcomes and Future Directions.,"Background This prospective cohort study aimed to evaluate the short-term clinical outcomes of drug-eluting balloons (DEBs) versus stenting in provisional bifurcation lesions, focusing on procedural success, safety, and major adverse cardiac events (MACE). The study specifically assessed key adverse outcomes, including restenosis, target lesion revascularization (TLR), myocardial infarction (MI), stent thrombosis, and mortality. Bifurcation lesions present significant challenges in interventional cardiology due to their complex anatomy, which contributes to a higher risk of restenosis, side-branch occlusion, and thrombotic events. This study compared the efficacy, safety, and procedural complexity of DEBs and stenting. Methodology Fifty patients with bifurcation lesions were enrolled and divided into two equal groups: 25 (50%) treated with DEBs and 25 (50%) treated with provisional stenting. The primary outcome measure was the incidence of MACE, including TLR, MI, stent thrombosis, and death. The study was conducted over one year, with follow-up assessments at one- and three months post-intervention. After the intervention, all patients were put on dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) comprising aspirin, clopidogrel, and high-intensity statins. Additionally, other medications were prescribed based on patient-specific needs. Results The DEB group exhibited an overall MACE rate of 2 (8%) compared with 3 (12%) in the stenting group (p = 0.58). Restenosis occurred in 1 (4%) of the DEB group and in 2 (8%) of the stenting group, whereas TLR was required in 1 (4%) and 2 (8%) of the patients, respectively. The incidence of MI was low in both groups 1 (4%), with no reported cases of stent thrombosis or death. No significant differences were observed between the groups in any of the clinical outcome measures (p > 0.05). The DEB group achieved treatment success without necessitating side-branch stenting or additional kissing balloon inflation, whereas the stenting group demonstrated comparable success, but increased procedural complexity. Conclusion DEBs and stenting showed comparable short-term efficacy and safety for provisional bifurcation lesions, offering the potential advantage of procedural simplicity. This study supports the viability of DEBs as an effective treatment option for selected bifurcation lesions, avoiding the additional complexities associated with stenting. However, larger studies with extended follow-up are necessary to validate these findings and inform clinical decision-making.",Cureus,2025,Cureus,Ziyad Muhammad; Shah Syed Tahir; Rauf Muhammad Abdur; Shah Syed Muzammil; Ullah Sana; Ullah Rafi; Khan Muhammad Ilyas,"Cardiology, Kuwait Teaching Hospital, Peshawar, PAK.; Cardiology, Kuwait Teaching Hospital, Peshawar, PAK.; Cardiology, Kuwait Teaching Hospital, Peshawar Medical College, Peshawar, PAK.; Cardiology, Kuwait Teaching Hospital, Peshawar, PAK.; Cardiology, Kuwait Teaching Hospital, Peshawar, PAK.; Cardiology, Kuwait Teaching Hospital, Peshawar, PAK.; Cardiology, Kuwait Teaching Hospital, Peshawar, PAK.",10.7759/cureus.78436,PMC11882106,N/A
40015616,"Genotype-guided de-escalation and abbreviation of dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with myocardial infarction and high bleeding risk: Design and rationale of the investigator-initiated, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial, DAN-DAPT.","Approximately one-third of patients with myocardial infarction (MI) treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are at high risk of bleeding side-effects when on dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). High bleeding risk is often accompanied by high ischemic risk, thus challenging the choice of P2Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitor and duration of DAPT. The optimal DAPT strategy for these patients remains debated, and it is unknown whether genotype-guided DAPT de-escalation to clopidogrel and aspirin, with or without abbreviation of DAPT to 3 months, is noninferior in terms of net adverse clinical events (NACE) and superior in reducing bleeding side-effects compared with standard DAPT for 6 months.",American heart journal,2025,Am Heart J,Jacobsen Mia Ravn; Jabbari Reza; Grove Erik Lerkevang; Mæng Michael; Veien Karsten; Hougaard Mikkel; Freeman Philip; Kelbæk Henning; Charlot Mette Gitz; Engstrøm Thomas; Sørensen Rikke,"Department of Cardiology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.
