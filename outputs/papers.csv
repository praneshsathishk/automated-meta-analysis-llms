40605381,Impact of Intravenous Nitrate Treatment on Antiplatelet Effects of Clopidogrel in Acute Coronary Syndrome Patients: A Pilot Study.,"BackgroundClopidogrel is a pro-drug that requires metabolic activation by hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes in two steps. Previous studies have shown that the administration of continuous nitrate significantly affects the activity of hepatic CYP. In this pilot study, we assess the impact of intravenous nitrate treatment on the antiplatelet effects of clopidogrel in patients with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).MethodWe included 20 NSTEMI patients: 15 in the nitrate group and five in the control group. All patients received a 300 mg acetylsalicylic acid and a 600 mg clopidogrel loading dose. The nitrate group was administered an intravenous glyceryl trinitrate infusion at 10 µg/min for 48 h. After the drugs were initiated, blood samples were collected from patients at intervals of 30th minutes, 60th minutes, 120th minutes, fourth hour, sixth hour, and 48th hour to assess platelet function. The antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel was evaluated using the platelet reactivity unit (PRU) from the Verify-Now P2Y12 assay.ResultThe PRU values at baseline and the 30th, 60th, 120th minutes, and 48th hour were similar between the two groups (<i>P</i> > .05). However, PRU values at the fourth and sixth hours were significantly higher in the nitrate group than in the control group (274.1 ± 53.9 vs 162.4 ± 39.9; <i>P</i> = .002 and 272.0 ± 67.0 vs 185.6 ± 18.1; <i>P</i> = .03, respectively).ConclusionIntravenous nitrate therapy in patients with NSTEMI delayed the onset of the antiplatelet effect of orally loaded clopidogrel by at least 4 h. This point should be kept in mind in patients using clopidogrel and nitrate therapy together.

40167885,Acute myocardial infarction in patients with cancer: outcomes and P2Y12 inhibition.,"Cancer patients are at an elevated risk of bleeding and ischemic events. There are limited comparative real-world data on outcomes of all-comer cancer patients after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) compared with non-cancer patients. There are also limited comparative data to guide P2Y12 inhibitor choice in cancer patients undergoing PCI. We queried the TriNetX research database from 2015 to 2023 to identify adult patients who received PCI for AMI. AMI patients were then stratified into cancer and non-cancer patients. Propensity score matching was used to account for imbalances in baseline characteristics. Cancer patients were further categorized into those who received dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with ticagrelor or clopidogrel in addition to aspirin. Outcomes of interest included all-cause mortality and major bleeding at 30-days and 1-year. Of 139,342 patients who underwent PCI for AMI, 6,766 (4.9%) had a history of cancer. Compared with AMI patients without cancer, cancer patients had higher 1-year all-cause mortality (20.1% vs. 12.7%; HR 1.59; 95% CI, 1.46-1.73) and major bleeding (16.9% vs. 10.2%; HR 1.69; 95% CI 1.54-1.86). Among cancer patients with AMI, those treated with ticagrelor-based DAPT after PCI had similar incidence of bleeding complications compared with those treated with clopidogrel (HR 1.04; 95% CI 0.77-1.40). Cancer is an adverse prognostic marker for AMI outcomes and is independently associated with substantially higher mortality and bleeding risk. Among cancer patients undergoing PCI for AMI, ticagrelor use is associated with similar bleeding events compared with clopidogrel.",Journal of thrombosis and thrombolysis,2025,J Thromb Thrombolysis,Cordova Sanchez Andres; Holmes Chris E; Dauerman Harold L; Gupta Tanush,"Division of Cardiology, University of Vermont Medical Center, Burlington, VT, USA.; Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Vermont Medical Center, Burlington, VT, USA.; Division of Cardiology, University of Vermont Medical Center, Burlington, VT, USA.; Division of Cardiology, University of Vermont Medical Center, Burlington, VT, USA.

39696804,Impact of Dual Antithrombotic Therapy with Aspirin and Rivaroxaban on Secondary Cardiovascular Outcomes.,"BACKGROUND Dual antiplatelet therapy is the main treatment for cardiovascular diseases (CADs). In this study, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of aspirin combined with low-dose rivaroxaban in the secondary prevention of high-risk ischemic cardiovascular diseases. MATERIAL AND METHODS In total, 168 patients who were diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction or multiple vessel disease 1 year after percutaneous coronary intervention were divided into 2 groups: the aspirin group (aspirin as acetylsalicylic acid: 100 mg once daily) and the aspirin + rivaroxaban group (aspirin: 100 mg once daily, rivaroxaban: 2.5 mg twice daily). The patients were followed up for 2 years to assess the clinical efficacy and safety of a new dual-channel antithrombotic treatment strategy. RESULTS The occurrence of MACE (recurrent myocardial infarction, in-stent restenosis, coronary target vessel revascularization, stent thrombosis, heart failure, rehospitalization, and all-cause mortality) in the rivaroxaban + aspirin group was lower than that in the aspirin group (3.57% of patients received aspirin + rivaroxaban treatment vs 13.10% of patients received aspirin treatment). There were not more adverse events in the rivaroxaban + aspirin group than in the aspirin group. Compared with patients administered aspirin, the coagulation function of patients taking aspirin + rivaroxaban was significantly changed. No heart failure occurred in either group of patients with CADs. CONCLUSIONS Aspirin + rivaroxaban had better primary outcome and secondary outcomes in patients with a high risk of ischemia. Our results provide a basis for evaluating the efficacy and safety of drugs used in secondary prevention among patients with high risk of ischemia.",Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,2024,Med Sci Monit,Li Wei; Li Yi; Liu Chen; Yuan Jinghao; Fan Weize; Miao Qing; Gu Xinshun,"Department of Cardiovascular, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China.; Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China.; Department of Cardiovascular, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China.; Department of Cardiovascular, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China.; Department of Cardiovascular, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China.; Department of Cardiovascular, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China.; Department of Cardiovascular, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China.",10.12659/MSM.945457,PMC11667943,N/A
39674322,"Aspirin modulates generation of procoagulant phospholipids in cardiovascular disease, by regulating LPCAT3.","Enzymatically oxygenated phospholipids (eoxPL) from lipoxygenases (LOX) or cyclooxygenase (COX) are prothrombotic. Their generation in arterial disease, and their modulation by cardiovascular therapies is unknown. Furthermore, the Lands cycle acyl-transferases that catalyze their formation are unidentified. eoxPL were measured in platelets and leukocytes from an atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) cohort and retrieved human arterial thrombi from three anatomical sites. The impact of age, gender, and aspirin was characterized in platelets from healthy subjects administered low-dose aspirin. The role of lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3 (LPCAT3) in eoxPL biosynthesis was tested using an inhibitor and a cell-free assay. Platelets from ASCVD patients generated lower levels of COX-derived eoxPL but elevated 12-LOX-diacyl forms, than platelets from healthy controls. This associated with aspirin and was recapitulated in healthy subjects by aspirin supplementation. P2Y12 inhibition had no impact on eoxPL. LPCAT3 inhibition selectively prevented 12-LOX-derived diacyl-eoxPL generation. LPCAT3 activity was not directly altered by aspirin. P2Y12 inhibition or aspirin had little impact on eoxPL in leukocytes. Complex aspirin-dependent gender and seasonal effects on platelet eoxPL generation were seen in healthy subjects. Limb or coronary (ST-elevation myocardial infarction, STEMI) thrombi displayed a platelet eoxPL signature while carotid thrombi had a white cell profile. EoxPL are altered in ASCVD by a commonly used cardiovascular therapy, and LPCAT3 was identified as the acyltransferase generating aspirin-sensitive 12-LOX diacyl forms. These changes to the phospholipid composition of blood cells in humans at risk of thrombosis may be clinically significant where the procoagulant membrane plays a central role in driving elevated thrombotic risk.",Journal of lipid research,2025,J Lipid Res,Protty Majd B; Tyrrell Victoria J; Hajeyah Ali A; Morgan Bethan; Costa Daniela; Li Yong; Choudhury Anirban; Mitra Rito; Bosanquet David; Reed Alex; Denisenko Iuliia K; Nagata Katsuyuki; Shindou Hideo; Cravatt Benjamin F; Poole Alastair W; Shimizu Takao; Yousef Zaheer; Collins Peter W; O'Donnell Valerie B,"Systems Immunity Research Institute, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.

He was a heavy smoker and a chronic alcoholic. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed no specific change. A coronary computed tomography showed moderate stenosis with soft plaque at the distal segment of right coronary artery. His pain was improved with antianginal and reflux medications. Twenty days later, he ran to the emergency room complaining of squeezing chest pain. ECG showed mild ST segment elevation in inferior territories. Invasive coronary angiography via right radial artery revealed severe thrombotic occlusion at the same lesion. A bare metal stent was deployed and dual antiplatelet therapy including aspirin and clopidogrel had been maintained for 6 months under the conventional hemophilia management. The patient did not develop any coronary events just with single clopidogrel therapy for 5 years until he passed away from pancreatic cancer.

39195314,Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance and Associated Cardiovascular Outcomes in a Hospital Setting-A Fresh Perspective.,"There is a paucity of data on the cardiovascular implications of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, especially among hospitalized patients. Our study aimed to investigate the association between MGUS and cardiovascular outcomes in a hospital setting using the National Inpatient Sample database. MGUS patients were sampled using ICD-10 codes. The patients were stratified into two cohorts based on the presence or absence of MGUS. Comorbidities and cardiovascular outcomes were collected using ICD 10 DM codes. CV outcomes were evaluated before and after 1:1 matching for age, gender, and race. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis was performed on the matched population, which excluded patients with diabetes mellitus, prior myocardial infarction, chronic kidney disease (stages 3-5), dialysis, hypertension, obesity, metabolic syndrome, cancer, antiplatelets, and oral anticoagulant use and was adjusted for smoking, dyslipidemia, and aspirin use to evaluate the cardiovascular outcomes. MGUS patients had more heart failure, atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolism, aortic aneurysm, aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, mitral stenosis, mitral regurgitation, conduction disorder, cor pulmonale, peripheral vascular disease, and acute myocardial infarction. After matching, MGUS was associated with heart failure, atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolism, aortic stenosis, mitral regurgitation, conduction disorder, cor pulmonale, and peripheral vascular disease. MGUS was linked to a wide spectrum of cardiovascular diseases in an inpatient setting. Further studies are needed to formulate appropriate recommendations for the screening and management of cardiovascular complications in individuals with MGUS.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2024,Curr Oncol,Mustafa Ahmad; Wei Chapman; Araji Ghada; Niazi Muhammad Rafay Khan; Grovu Radu; Weinberg Mitchell; Lafferty James,"Department of Cardiology, Northwell Health/Staten Island University Hospital, Staten Island, New York, NY 10305, USA.; Department of Internal Medicine, Northwell Health/Staten Island University Hospital, Staten Island, New York, NY 10305, USA.; Department of Internal Medicine, Northwell Health/Staten Island University Hospital, Staten Island, New York, NY 10305, USA.; Department of Hematology and Oncology, Northwell Health/Staten Island University Hospital, Staten Island, New York, NY 10305, USA.; Department of Internal Medicine, Northwell Health/Staten Island University Hospital, Staten Island, New York, NY 10305, USA.; Department of Cardiology, Northwell Health/Staten Island University Hospital, Staten Island, New York, NY 10305, USA.; Department of Cardiology, Northwell Health/Staten Island University Hospital, Staten Island, New York, NY 10305, USA.",10.3390/curroncol31080331,PMC11352401,N/A

39161215,Development and Validation of a Nomogram Model for Predicting in-Hospital Mortality in non-Diabetic Patients with non-ST-Segment Elevation Acute Myocardial Infarction.,"Non-ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) is a life-threatening clinical emergency with a poor prognosis. However, there are no individualized nomogram models to identify patients at high risk of NSTEMI who may undergo death. The aim of this study was to develop a nomogram for in-hospital mortality in patients with NSTEMI to facilitate rapid risk stratification of patients. A total of 774 non-diabetic patients with NSTEMI were included in this study. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator regression was used to initially screen potential predictors. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression (backward stepwise selection) analyses were performed to identify the optimal predictors for the prediction model. The corresponding nomogram was constructed based on those predictors. The receiver operating characteristic curve, GiViTI calibration plot, and decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to evaluate the performance of the nomogram. The nomogram model consisting of six predictors: age (OR = 1.10; 95% CI: 1.05-1.15), blood urea nitrogen (OR = 1.06; 95% CI: 1.00-1.12), albumin (OR = 0.93; 95% CI: 0.87-1.00), triglyceride (OR = 1.41; 95% CI: 1.09-2.00), D-dimer (OR = 1.39; 95% CI: 1.06-1.80), and aspirin (OR = 0.16; 95% CI: 0.06-0.42). The nomogram had good discrimination (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.84-0.94), calibration, and clinical usefulness. In this study, we developed a nomogram model to predict in-hospital mortality in patients with NSTEMI based on common clinical indicators.

39115322,The safety and efficacy of indobufen or aspirin combined with clopidogrel in patients with acute myocardial infarction after percutaneous coronary intervention.,"Currently, the standard treatment for patients who have undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) following acute myocardial infarction (MI) involves dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with a combination of aspirin and a potent P2Y12 receptor inhibitor. However, the potential benefits of aspirin were partially constrained by the intolerance of some patients. The safety and efficacy of indobufen, an alternative antiplatelet agents to aspirin, in patients with AMI after PCI are yet to be thoroughly investigated.This retrospective study was conducted at a single center and utilized propensity score matching. The enrollment spanned from January 2019 to June 2022, incorporating patients with AMI after PCI. The participants were categorized into two groups based on discharged prescriptions: the aspirin DAPT group and the indobufen DAPT group. The primary endpoint focused on net adverse clinical event (NACE), defined as a composite outcome, including cardiac death, recurrence of MI, definite or probable stent thrombosis (ST), target lesion revascularization (TLR), ischemic stroke and Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) criteria type 2, 3, or 5. All the patients underwent a one-year follow-up period.A total of 1451 patients were enrolled in this study, with 258 assigned to the indobufen DAPT group and 1193 to the aspirin DAPT group. Following 1:1 propensity score matching, 224 patients were retained in each group. In the indobufen DAPT group, 58 individuals (25.9%) experienced the primary endpoint within one year, compared to 52 individuals (23.2%) in the aspirin DAPT group (HR 1.128, 95% CI 0.776-1.639, <i>p</i> = .527). Specifically, no significant differences were observed in either the efficacy endpoint (MACCE, 20.1% vs. 14.7%, HR 1.392, 95% CI 0.893-2.170, <i>p</i> = .146) or the safety endpoint (BARC 2,3 or 5, 8.04% vs. 10.30%, HR 0.779, <i>p</i> = .427). These findings remained consistent at 1, 3, or 6 months.

38914608,Low platelet count at admission has an adverse impact on outcome in patients with acute coronary syndromes: from the START Antiplatelet registry.,"Some previous observations suggest that a low platelet count is associated with an increased risk of adverse outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). However, most of the data come from post-hoc analyses of randomized controlled trials and from studies including thrombocytopenia developed during hospital stay. Our aim was to assess the impact of low platelet count at admission on cardiovascular outcomes and treatment approach in patients hospitalized for ACS in a current real-life setting in Italy. Patients admitted to Italian coronary care units for ACS were enrolled in the START-ANTIPLATELET registry. Baseline clinical characteristics and treatment at discharge were recorded. Patients were followed-up at 6 months, 1 year and yearly thereafter. Low platelet count was defined as a count at admission < 150 > 100 k/µl or < 100 k/µL. Among 1894 enrolled patients, 157 (8.3%) had a platelet count < 150 > 100 k/µl and 30 (1.6%) < 100 k/µl. The median follow-up was 12.3 months (0.4-50.1). patients with low platelets were older (72 ± 10.4 vs 66 ± 12.4 years, p = 0.006), more frequently males (82.9 vs 72.1%, p = 0.001), hypertensive (90.0% vs 70.4%, p = 0.03), with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) (17.1 vs 8.6%, p = 0.02), and peripheral arterial disease (11.5 vs 6.2% p = 0.01) and/or had a previous myocardial infarction (40 vs 18.7%, p = 0.008) and/or a PCI (14.6 vs 7.8%, p = 0.001) than patients with normal platelets. A slightly, but significantly, lower percentage of thrombocytopenic patients were treated with primary PCI (78.1 vs 84.4%, p = 0.04) and they were more frequently discharged on aspirin plus clopidogrel rather than aspirin plus newer P2Y<sub>12</sub> antagonists (51.9 vs 65.4%, p = 0.01). MACE-free survival was significantly shorter in thrombocytopenic patients compared to patients with normal platelets (< 150 > 100 k/µl: 37.6 vs 41.8 months, p = 0.002; HR = 2.7, 95% CIs 1.4-5.2; < 100 k/µl: 31.7 vs 41.8 months, p = 0.01; HR = 6.5, 95% CIs 1.5-29.1). At multivariate analysis, low platelet count, age at enrollment, low glomerular filtration rate, low ejection fraction, a previous ischemic stroke and NVAF were independent predictors of MACE. A low platelet count at admission identifies a subgroup of ACS patients with a significantly increased risk of MACE and these patients should be managed with special care to prevent excess adverse outcomes.",Scientific reports,2024,Sci Rep,Gresele Paolo; Guglielmini Giuseppe; Del Pinto Maurizio; Calabrò Paolo; Pignatelli Pasquale; Patti Giuseppe; Pengo Vittorio; Antonucci Emilia; Cirillo Plinio; Fierro Tiziana; Palareti Gualtiero; Marcucci Rossella,"Department of Medicine and Surgery, Section of Internal and Cardiovascular Medicine, University of Perugia, Strada Vicinale Via Delle Corse, S.
