PMC10289750,37352067,Pre-aspirin use has no benefit on the neurological disability and mortality after cardiovascular events: A nation-wide population-based cohort study.,"To evaluate the effects of aspirin in the primary prevention, we evaluated disability grades and mortality after ischemic/hemorrhagic stroke and myocardial infarction (MI). A retrospective nation-wide propensity score-matched cohort study was performed using the Korean National Health Information Database. From 3,060,639 subjects who were older than 55 and performed national health examinations in 2004 and 2005, we selected the aspirin group (N = 8770) was composed of patients who had received aspirin prior to cardiovascular events. Cox proportional hazards model was used to compare the acquisition times for neurologic disability grades and survival times between the aspirin and control groups. Only in hemorrhagic stroke, the severe neurologic disability risk was higher in the aspirin group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.21; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.42). The aspirin group was associated with higher 90-day (HR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.23-1.44) and long-term mortality risk (HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.03-1.10) after pooling 3 events. The old age was a strong risk factor for 90-day mortality in hemorrhagic stroke (50s: reference; 60s: HR 2.21, 95% CI 1.50-3.25; 70s: HR 3.63, 95% CI 2.48-5.30; 80s: HR 6.69, 95% CI 4.54-9.65; >90s: HR 11.28, 95% CI 6.46-19.70). Pre-aspirin use in cardiovascular events has detrimental effects on severe neurological disability in hemorrhagic stroke and short-/long-term mortality in 3 cardiovascular events. The use of aspirin for the primary prevention especially in the elderly should be very cautious because the old age is a strong risk factor for 90-day mortality after hemorrhagic stroke.",Medicine,2023,Medicine (Baltimore),Kim Jong Hun; Park Dougho; Lim Hyun Sun; Kang Min Jin; Lee Jun Hong; Yoon Seo Yeon; Kim Hyoung Seop,"Department of Neurology, National Health Insurance Service Ilsan Hospital, Goyang, South Korea.; Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Pohang Stroke and Spine Hospital, Pohang, South Korea.; Research and Analysis Team, National Health Insurance Service Ilsan Hospital, Goyang, South Korea.; Research and Analysis Team, National Health Insurance Service Ilsan Hospital, Goyang, South Korea.; Department of Neurology, National Health Insurance Service Ilsan Hospital, Goyang, South Korea.; Department of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation, Korea University Guro Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea.; Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, National Health Insurance Service Ilsan Hospital, Goyang, South Korea.",10.1097/MD.0000000000034109,
PMC4631331,26529110,Acute Myocardial Infarction Risk in Patients with Coronary Artery Disease Doubled after Upper Gastrointestinal Tract Bleeding: A Nationwide Nested Case-Control Study.,"Prior studies of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are small, and long-term effects of UGIB on AMI have not been delineated. We investigated whether UGIB in patients diagnosed with coronary artery disease (CAD) increased their risk of subsequent AMI. This was a population-based, nested case-control study using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. After propensity-score matching for age, gender, comorbidities, CAD date, and follow-up duration, we identified 1,677 new-onset CAD patients with AMI (AMI[+]) between 2001 and 2006 as the case group and 10,062 new-onset CAD patients without (AMI[-]) as the control group. Conditional logistic regression was used to examine the association between UGIB and AMI. Compared with UGIB[-] patients, UGIB[+] patients had twice the risk for subsequent AMI (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.72-2.50). In the subgroup analysis for gender and age, UGIB[+] women (AOR = 2.70; 95% CI, 2.03-3.57) and patients < 65 years old (AOR = 2.23; 95% CI, 1.56-3.18) had higher odds of an AMI. UGIB[+] AMI[+] patients used nonsignificantly less aspirin than did UGIB[-] AMI[+] patients (27.69% vs. 35.61%, respectively). UGIB increased the risk of subsequent AMI in CAD patients, especially in women and patients < 65. This suggests that physicians need to use earlier and more aggressive intervention to detect UGIB and prevent AMI in CAD patients.",PloS one,2015,PLoS One,Wu Chia-Jung; Lin Hung-Jung; Weng Shih-Feng; Hsu Chien-Chin; Wang Jhi-Joung; Su Shih-Bin; Huang Chien-Cheng; Guo How-Ran,"Department of Emergency Medicine, Chi-Mei Medical Center, Tainan, Taiwan.; Department of Emergency Medicine, Chi-Mei Medical Center, Tainan, Taiwan; Department of Emergency Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Biotechnology, Southern Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Tainan, Taiwan.; Department of Medical Research, Chi-Mei Medical Center, Tainan, Taiwan; Department of Healthcare Administration and Medical Informatics, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.; Department of Emergency Medicine, Chi-Mei Medical Center, Tainan, Taiwan; Department of Biotechnology, Southern Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Tainan, Taiwan.; Department of Medical Research, Chi-Mei Medical Center, Tainan, Taiwan.; Department of Occupational Medicine, Chi-Mei Medical Center, Tainan, Taiwan; Department of Leisure, Recreation and Tourism Management, Southern Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Tainan, Taiwan; Department of Medical Research, Chi Mei Medical Center, Liouying, Tainan, Taiwan.; Department of Emergency Medicine, Chi-Mei Medical Center, Tainan, Taiwan; Department of Occupational Medicine, Chi-Mei Medical Center, Tainan, Taiwan; Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan; Department of Child Care and Education, Southern Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Tainan, Taiwan; Department of Geriatrics and Geronotology, Chi-Mei Medical Center, Tainan, Taiwan.; Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan; Department of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, Tainan, Taiwan.",10.1371/journal.pone.0142000,
