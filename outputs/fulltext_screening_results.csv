PMC10899234,38413716,Antiplatelet therapy prior to COVID-19 infection impacts on patients mortality: a propensity score-matched cohort study.,"One of the major pathomechanisms of COVID-19 is the interplay of hyperinflammation and disruptions in coagulation processes, involving thrombocytes. Antiplatelet therapy (AP) by anti-inflammatory effect and inhibition of platelet aggregation may affect these pathways. The aim of this study was to investigate if AP has an impact on the in-hospital course and medium-term outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The study population (2170 COVID-19 patients: mean ± SD age 60 ± 19 years old, 50% male) was divided into a group of 274 patients receiving any AP prior to COVID-19 infection (AP group), and after propensity score matching, a group of 274 patients without previous AP (non-AP group). Patients from the AP group were less frequently hospitalized in the intensive care unit: 9% vs. 15%, 0.55 (0.33-0.94), developed less often shock: 9% vs. 15%, 0.56 (0.33-0.96), and required less aggressive forms of therapy. The AP group had more coronary revascularizations: 5% vs. 1%, 3.48 (2.19-5.55) and strokes/TIA: 5% vs. 1%, 3.63 (1.18-11.2). The bleeding rate was comparable: 7% vs. 7%, 1.06 (0.54-2.06). The patients from the AP group had lower 3-month mortality: 31% vs. 39%, 0.69 (0.51-0.93) and didn't differ significantly in 6-month mortality: 34% vs. 41%, 0.79 (0.60-1.04). When analyzing the subgroup with a history of myocardial infarction and/or coronary revascularization and/or previous stroke/transient ischemic attack and/or peripheral artery disease, AP had a beneficial effect on both 3-month: 37% vs. 56%, 0.58 (0.40-0.86) and 6-month mortality: 42% vs. 57%, 0.63 (0.44-0.92). Moreover, the favourable effect was highly noticeable in this subgroup where acetylsalicylic acid was continued during hospitalization with reduction of in-hospital: 19% vs. 43%, 0.31 (0.15-0.67), 3-month: 30% vs. 54%, 044 (0.26-0.75) and 6-month mortality: 33% vs. 54%, 0.49 (0.29-0.82) when confronted with the subgroup who had acetylsalicylic acid suspension during hospitalization. The AP may have a beneficial impact on hospital course and mortality in COVID-19 and shouldn't be discontinued, especially in high-risk patients.",Scientific reports,2024,Sci Rep,Sokolski Mateusz; Reszka Konrad; Adamik Barbara; Kilis-Pstrusinska Katarzyna; Lis Weronika; Pomorski Michał; Sokolowski Janusz; Doroszko Adrian; Madziarska Katarzyna; Jankowska Ewa Anita; Protasiewicz Marcin,"Institute of Heart Disease, Wroclaw Medical University, Borowska 213, 50-556, Wroclaw, Poland. mateusz.sokolski@umw.edu.pl.; Institute of Heart Disease, University Hospital, Wroclaw, Poland.; Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Therapy, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.; Clinical Department of Pediatric Nephrology, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.; Institute of Heart Disease, University Hospital, Wroclaw, Poland.; Clinical Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.; Clinical Department of Emergency Medicine, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.; Clinical Department of Internal and Occupational Diseases, Hypertension and Clinical Oncology, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.; Department of Nephrology and Transplantation Medicine, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.; Institute of Heart Disease, Wroclaw Medical University, Borowska 213, 50-556, Wroclaw, Poland.; Institute of Heart Disease, Wroclaw Medical University, Borowska 213, 50-556, Wroclaw, Poland.",10.1038/s41598-024-55407-9,

PMC11196263,38914608,Low platelet count at admission has an adverse impact on outcome in patients with acute coronary syndromes: from the START Antiplatelet registry.,"Some previous observations suggest that a low platelet count is associated with an increased risk of adverse outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). However, most of the data come from post-hoc analyses of randomized controlled trials and from studies including thrombocytopenia developed during hospital stay. Our aim was to assess the impact of low platelet count at admission on cardiovascular outcomes and treatment approach in patients hospitalized for ACS in a current real-life setting in Italy. Patients admitted to Italian coronary care units for ACS were enrolled in the START-ANTIPLATELET registry. Baseline clinical characteristics and treatment at discharge were recorded. Patients were followed-up at 6 months, 1 year and yearly thereafter. Low platelet count was defined as a count at admission < 150 > 100 k/µl or < 100 k/µL. Among 1894 enrolled patients, 157 (8.3%) had a platelet count < 150 > 100 k/µl and 30 (1.6%) < 100 k/µl. The median follow-up was 12.3 months (0.4-50.1). patients with low platelets were older (72 ± 10.4 vs 66 ± 12.4 years, p = 0.006), more frequently males (82.9 vs 72.1%, p = 0.001), hypertensive (90.0% vs 70.4%, p = 0.03), with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) (17.1 vs 8.6%, p = 0.02), and peripheral arterial disease (11.5 vs 6.2% p = 0.01) and/or had a previous myocardial infarction (40 vs 18.7%, p = 0.008) and/or a PCI (14.6 vs 7.8%, p = 0.001) than patients with normal platelets. A slightly, but significantly, lower percentage of thrombocytopenic patients were treated with primary PCI (78.1 vs 84.4%, p = 0.04) and they were more frequently discharged on aspirin plus clopidogrel rather than aspirin plus newer P2Y<sub>12</sub> antagonists (51.9 vs 65.4%, p = 0.01). MACE-free survival was significantly shorter in thrombocytopenic patients compared to patients with normal platelets (< 150 > 100 k/µl: 37.6 vs 41.8 months, p = 0.002; HR = 2.7, 95% CIs 1.4-5.2; < 100 k/µl: 31.7 vs 41.8 months, p = 0.01; HR = 6.5, 95% CIs 1.5-29.1). At multivariate analysis, low platelet count, age at enrollment, low glomerular filtration rate, low ejection fraction, a previous ischemic stroke and NVAF were independent predictors of MACE. A low platelet count at admission identifies a subgroup of ACS patients with a significantly increased risk of MACE and these patients should be managed with special care to prevent excess adverse outcomes.",Scientific reports,2024,Sci Rep,Gresele Paolo; Guglielmini Giuseppe; Del Pinto Maurizio; Calabrò Paolo; Pignatelli Pasquale; Patti Giuseppe; Pengo Vittorio; Antonucci Emilia; Cirillo Plinio; Fierro Tiziana; Palareti Gualtiero; Marcucci Rossella,"Department of Medicine and Surgery, Section of Internal and Cardiovascular Medicine, University of Perugia, Strada Vicinale Via Delle Corse, S.

However, there are no individualized nomogram models to identify patients at high risk of NSTEMI who may undergo death. The aim of this study was to develop a nomogram for in-hospital mortality in patients with NSTEMI to facilitate rapid risk stratification of patients. A total of 774 non-diabetic patients with NSTEMI were included in this study. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator regression was used to initially screen potential predictors. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression (backward stepwise selection) analyses were performed to identify the optimal predictors for the prediction model. The corresponding nomogram was constructed based on those predictors. The receiver operating characteristic curve, GiViTI calibration plot, and decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to evaluate the performance of the nomogram. The nomogram model consisting of six predictors: age (OR = 1.10; 95% CI: 1.05-1.15), blood urea nitrogen (OR = 1.06; 95% CI: 1.00-1.12), albumin (OR = 0.93; 95% CI: 0.87-1.00), triglyceride (OR = 1.41; 95% CI: 1.09-2.00), D-dimer (OR = 1.39; 95% CI: 1.06-1.80), and aspirin (OR = 0.16; 95% CI: 0.06-0.42). The nomogram had good discrimination (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.84-0.94), calibration, and clinical usefulness. In this study, we developed a nomogram model to predict in-hospital mortality in patients with NSTEMI based on common clinical indicators.

Our study aimed to investigate the association between MGUS and cardiovascular outcomes in a hospital setting using the National Inpatient Sample database. MGUS patients were sampled using ICD-10 codes. The patients were stratified into two cohorts based on the presence or absence of MGUS. Comorbidities and cardiovascular outcomes were collected using ICD 10 DM codes. CV outcomes were evaluated before and after 1:1 matching for age, gender, and race. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis was performed on the matched population, which excluded patients with diabetes mellitus, prior myocardial infarction, chronic kidney disease (stages 3-5), dialysis, hypertension, obesity, metabolic syndrome, cancer, antiplatelets, and oral anticoagulant use and was adjusted for smoking, dyslipidemia, and aspirin use to evaluate the cardiovascular outcomes. MGUS patients had more heart failure, atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolism, aortic aneurysm, aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, mitral stenosis, mitral regurgitation, conduction disorder, cor pulmonale, peripheral vascular disease, and acute myocardial infarction. After matching, MGUS was associated with heart failure, atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolism, aortic stenosis, mitral regurgitation, conduction disorder, cor pulmonale, and peripheral vascular disease. MGUS was linked to a wide spectrum of cardiovascular diseases in an inpatient setting. Further studies are needed to formulate appropriate recommendations for the screening and management of cardiovascular complications in individuals with MGUS.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2024,Curr Oncol,Mustafa Ahmad; Wei Chapman; Araji Ghada; Niazi Muhammad Rafay Khan; Grovu Radu; Weinberg Mitchell; Lafferty James,"Department of Cardiology, Northwell Health/Staten Island University Hospital, Staten Island, New York, NY 10305, USA.; Department of Internal Medicine, Northwell Health/Staten Island University Hospital, Staten Island, New York, NY 10305, USA.; Department of Internal Medicine, Northwell Health/Staten Island University Hospital, Staten Island, New York, NY 10305, USA.; Department of Hematology and Oncology, Northwell Health/Staten Island University Hospital, Staten Island, New York, NY 10305, USA.; Department of Internal Medicine, Northwell Health/Staten Island University Hospital, Staten Island, New York, NY 10305, USA.; Department of Cardiology, Northwell Health/Staten Island University Hospital, Staten Island, New York, NY 10305, USA.; Department of Cardiology, Northwell Health/Staten Island University Hospital, Staten Island, New York, NY 10305, USA.",10.3390/curroncol31080331,

PMC11754521,39674322,"Aspirin modulates generation of procoagulant phospholipids in cardiovascular disease, by regulating LPCAT3.","Enzymatically oxygenated phospholipids (eoxPL) from lipoxygenases (LOX) or cyclooxygenase (COX) are prothrombotic. Their generation in arterial disease, and their modulation by cardiovascular therapies is unknown. Furthermore, the Lands cycle acyl-transferases that catalyze their formation are unidentified. eoxPL were measured in platelets and leukocytes from an atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) cohort and retrieved human arterial thrombi from three anatomical sites. The impact of age, gender, and aspirin was characterized in platelets from healthy subjects administered low-dose aspirin. The role of lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3 (LPCAT3) in eoxPL biosynthesis was tested using an inhibitor and a cell-free assay. Platelets from ASCVD patients generated lower levels of COX-derived eoxPL but elevated 12-LOX-diacyl forms, than platelets from healthy controls. This associated with aspirin and was recapitulated in healthy subjects by aspirin supplementation. P2Y12 inhibition had no impact on eoxPL. LPCAT3 inhibition selectively prevented 12-LOX-derived diacyl-eoxPL generation. LPCAT3 activity was not directly altered by aspirin. P2Y12 inhibition or aspirin had little impact on eoxPL in leukocytes. Complex aspirin-dependent gender and seasonal effects on platelet eoxPL generation were seen in healthy subjects. Limb or coronary (ST-elevation myocardial infarction, STEMI) thrombi displayed a platelet eoxPL signature while carotid thrombi had a white cell profile. EoxPL are altered in ASCVD by a commonly used cardiovascular therapy, and LPCAT3 was identified as the acyltransferase generating aspirin-sensitive 12-LOX diacyl forms. These changes to the phospholipid composition of blood cells in humans at risk of thrombosis may be clinically significant where the procoagulant membrane plays a central role in driving elevated thrombotic risk.",Journal of lipid research,2025,J Lipid Res,Protty Majd B; Tyrrell Victoria J; Hajeyah Ali A; Morgan Bethan; Costa Daniela; Li Yong; Choudhury Anirban; Mitra Rito; Bosanquet David; Reed Alex; Denisenko Iuliia K; Nagata Katsuyuki; Shindou Hideo; Cravatt Benjamin F; Poole Alastair W; Shimizu Takao; Yousef Zaheer; Collins Peter W; O'Donnell Valerie B,"Systems Immunity Research Institute, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.
