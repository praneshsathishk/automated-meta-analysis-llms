**Title and Research Question**
What Mechanisms Underlie Cholesterol Crystal Formation and its Contribution to Myocardial Infarction in Human Subjects?

**Background & Rationale**
Myocardial infarction (MI) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Cholesterol crystals (CCs) are known to play a crucial role in the development of MI, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. This meta-analysis aims to synthesize existing knowledge on CC formation and its contribution to MI.

**Summary of Included Studies**
Three studies were included in this meta-analysis: PMC11881462, PMC12076410, and PMC12223531.

**Populations & Sample Sizes**
The populations studied varied across the three included papers. PMC11881462 investigated human plaques with rupture and erosion, while PMC12076410 focused on reproductive-aged female individuals, approximately 10% of whom had endometriosis. PMC12223531 provided a general overview of the global burden of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) without specifying a particular population.

Sample sizes were not consistently reported across the studies. PMC11881462 did not provide specific sample sizes, while PMC12076410 and PMC12223531 mentioned total participants but did not specify sample sizes for specific groups.

**Interventions & Comparators**
The included studies employed various interventions and comparators. PMC11881462 examined the formation of CCs during MI without a comparator group. PMC12076410 investigated the relationship between aspirin use and cardiovascular event risk in individuals with endometriosis, using self-reported endometriosis history at baseline as a comparator. PMC12223531 discussed the global burden of CVD without presenting an intervention or comparator.

**Outcomes & Effects**
The outcomes studied varied across the three papers. PMC11881462 examined plaque rupture, ischemic and inflammatory tissue injury, and plaque hemorrhage, while PMC12076410 focused on cardiovascular event risk, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), and stroke risk. PMC12223531 discussed the global burden of CVD, platelet activation, and thrombus formation.

**Study Designs & Methodology**
The study designs employed varied across the included studies. PMC11881462 was an in vitro study using scanning images, mechanistic explanation, and observational data. PMC12076410 conducted an observational cohort study with inverse probability weighting, while PMC12223531 presented a narrative review or overview article.

**Synthesis and Interpretation of Results**
This meta-analysis suggests that CC formation during MI may contribute to plaque rupture and secondary ischemic and inflammatory tissue injury (PMC11881462). The relationship between aspirin use and cardiovascular event risk in individuals with endometriosis appears to be unclear, as the study did not find a significant association (PMC12076410). The global burden of CVD was highlighted, emphasizing the need for effective prevention and management strategies (PMC12223531).

**Limitations**
This meta-analysis is limited by the variation in study designs, populations, and outcome measures across the included studies. Additionally, sample sizes were not consistently reported, which may impact the generalizability of the findings.

**Final Conclusion**
In conclusion, this meta-analysis synthesizes existing knowledge on CC formation and its contribution to MI. While the included studies provide insights into the mechanisms underlying CC formation, the results suggest that further research is needed to fully elucidate the role of CCs in MI. The limitations of the current body of evidence highlight the need for well-designed, randomized controlled trials to investigate the efficacy of interventions targeting CC formation and plaque rupture prevention.
