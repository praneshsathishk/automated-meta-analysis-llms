40632640,Why colchicine is not beneficial in patients with acute coronary syndrome? In search of a CLEAR answer.,"Neutrophil count is a risk factor for myocardial infarction (MI). Colchicine, a drug known as an anti-inflammatory, acts by selectively concentrating on neutrophils and impairing their function. Colchicine has been used successfully in the prevention of vascular events in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), but recently the largest clinical trial carried out with colchicine in this clinical setting was unexpectedly neutral in the comparison of placebo and colchicine in patients with recent MI. Among the characteristics that distinguish patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) from established CAD is the dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), often consisting of aspirin and clopidogrel. Clopidogrel significantly reduces neutrophil count and could play a competitive role with colchicine by blunting its clinical effect.",Coronary artery disease,2025,Coron Artery Dis,De Servi Stefano; Molteni Mauro; Cimminiello Claudio,"Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Pavia, Pavia.; Medical Department, Tradate Hospital, Azienda Ospedaliera di Varese, Azienda Socio Sanitaria dei Sette Laghi, Tradate.; Arianna Foundation on Anticoagulation, Bologna, Italy.",10.1097/MCA.0000000000001551,,

40569059,"Peripheral Artery Disease and Antithrombotic Management: A Global Perspective on Efficacy, Safety, and Access.","Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a severe manifestation of systemic atherosclerosis, affecting over 230 million individuals worldwide and leading to both limb-threatening ischemia and catastrophic cardiovascular events. This progression is driven in part by thrombosis, which arises from complex interactions of endothelial dysfunction, platelet activation, and thrombin generation. These processes culminate in acute limb ischemia, major amputations, and myocardial infarction. Antithrombotic therapy is fundamental to PAD management, with antiplatelet monotherapy (aspirin or clopidogrel) remaining first-line for symptomatic patients. However, the paradigm has shifted with dual-pathway inhibition (DPI), combining low-dose rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice daily) with aspirin, which reduces major adverse cardiovascular events by 24% and limb events by 46%, particularly in high-risk subgroups including postrevascularization or chronic limb-threatening ischemia patients. Despite these advances, bleeding risks (eg, gastrointestinal hemorrhage with DPI) and global disparities in access to therapies pose significant challenges. Current guidelines now stratify recommendations by risk: the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology endorses DPI for postrevascularization (class IIa), while the European Society of Cardiology reserves it for recurrent ischemia (class IIb). Emerging strategies target residual inflammatory risk (eg, colchicine) and vascular regeneration (stem cell therapy), yet cost and scalability limit widespread adoption, especially in developing nations bearing 70% of the PAD burden. The future of PAD care demands personalized approaches that integrate antithrombotic efficacy, bleeding mitigation, and socioeconomic realities. Further research is needed to refine risk stratification, expand access to DPI, and develop adjunctive therapies for this growing global health crisis.",Cardiology in review,2025,Cardiol Rev,Mohammadi Abbas; Vaseghi Yasaman; Rafatnia Ali; Mohammadi Somayeh; Frishman William H; Aronow Wilbert S,"From the Department of Medicine, Valley Health System, Las Vegas, NV.; From the Department of Medicine, Valley Health System, Las Vegas, NV.; From the Department of Medicine, Valley Health System, Las Vegas, NV.; Department of Anesthesia and Critical Care, University of Chicago, IL.; Department of Medicine, New York Medical College, Valhalla, NY.; Departments of Cardiology and Medicine, Westchester Medical Center and New York Medical College, Valhalla, NY.",10.1097/CRD.0000000000000989,,

40046649,The formation of cholesterol crystals and embolization during myocardial infarction.,"Cholesterol crystals (CCs) released into the coronary circulation during plaque rupture have multiple adverse impacts on both the arterial conduit as well as the myocardium. CCs form within the atheromatous plaque by the saturation of free cholesterol deposition via facilitated LDL-c entry because of a dysfunctional endothelium. Once formed, CCs are viewed as a foreign body and activate inflammation via the innate immune system. Eventually, an inflamed atheromatous plaque ruptures by virtue of the growth and expansion of CCs that begin to occupy a greater volume than the liquid phase cholesterol. In some instances, the sharp edges of CCs can puncture and tear the plaque's fibrous cap causing rupture leading to thrombosis and myocardial infarction. In these circumstances, CCs are released from the ruptured plaque and travel down the coronary artery where they can scrape the endothelial lining which enhances vasospastic activity, further worsening ischemia. Moreover, when CCs lodge in the distal arteriolar and capillary beds, they not only obstruct blood flow to further aggravate ischemia but also activate an inflammatory response in the myocardium that leads to further tissue injury. Treatment of CCs has thus far been limited but studies using statins, aspirin and colchicine have demonstrated them to be effective in dissolving CCs that may provide additional benefits for both prevention and potentially for acute cardiovascular events.",American heart journal plus : cardiology research and practice,2025,Am Heart J Plus,Mughal Jamal; Katkoori Venkat R; Nidorf Stefan Mark; Manu Megan; Abela George S,"Department of Medicine, Division of cardiology, Michigan State University, Lansing, MI, USA.; Department of Surgery, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA.; Heart and Cardiovascular Institute, Perkins Research Institute, Perth, WA, Australia.; College of Human Medicine, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA.; College of Human Medicine, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA.",10.1016/j.ahjo.2025.100509,PMC11881462,

The optimal DAPT strategy for these patients remains debated, and it is unknown whether genotype-guided DAPT de-escalation to clopidogrel and aspirin, with or without abbreviation of DAPT to 3 months, is noninferior in terms of net adverse clinical events (NACE) and superior in reducing bleeding side-effects compared with standard DAPT for 6 months.",American heart journal,2025,Am Heart J,Jacobsen Mia Ravn; Jabbari Reza; Grove Erik Lerkevang; Mæng Michael; Veien Karsten; Hougaard Mikkel; Freeman Philip; Kelbæk Henning; Charlot Mette Gitz; Engstrøm Thomas; Sørensen Rikke,"Department of Cardiology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.
