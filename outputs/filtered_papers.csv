37352067,Pre-aspirin use has no benefit on the neurological disability and mortality after cardiovascular events: A nation-wide population-based cohort study.,"To evaluate the effects of aspirin in the primary prevention, we evaluated disability grades and mortality after ischemic/hemorrhagic stroke and myocardial infarction (MI). A retrospective nation-wide propensity score-matched cohort study was performed using the Korean National Health Information Database. From 3,060,639 subjects who were older than 55 and performed national health examinations in 2004 and 2005, we selected the aspirin group (N = 8770) was composed of patients who had received aspirin prior to cardiovascular events. Cox proportional hazards model was used to compare the acquisition times for neurologic disability grades and survival times between the aspirin and control groups. Only in hemorrhagic stroke, the severe neurologic disability risk was higher in the aspirin group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.21; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.42). The aspirin group was associated with higher 90-day (HR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.23-1.44) and long-term mortality risk (HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.03-1.10) after pooling 3 events. The old age was a strong risk factor for 90-day mortality in hemorrhagic stroke (50s: reference; 60s: HR 2.21, 95% CI 1.50-3.25; 70s: HR 3.63, 95% CI 2.48-5.30; 80s: HR 6.69, 95% CI 4.54-9.65; >90s: HR 11.28, 95% CI 6.46-19.70). Pre-aspirin use in cardiovascular events has detrimental effects on severe neurological disability in hemorrhagic stroke and short-/long-term mortality in 3 cardiovascular events. The use of aspirin for the primary prevention especially in the elderly should be very cautious because the old age is a strong risk factor for 90-day mortality after hemorrhagic stroke.",Medicine,2023,Medicine (Baltimore),Kim Jong Hun; Park Dougho; Lim Hyun Sun; Kang Min Jin; Lee Jun Hong; Yoon Seo Yeon; Kim Hyoung Seop,"Department of Neurology, National Health Insurance Service Ilsan Hospital, Goyang, South Korea.; Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Pohang Stroke and Spine Hospital, Pohang, South Korea.; Research and Analysis Team, National Health Insurance Service Ilsan Hospital, Goyang, South Korea.; Research and Analysis Team, National Health Insurance Service Ilsan Hospital, Goyang, South Korea.; Department of Neurology, National Health Insurance Service Ilsan Hospital, Goyang, South Korea.; Department of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation, Korea University Guro Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea.; Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, National Health Insurance Service Ilsan Hospital, Goyang, South Korea.",10.1097/MD.0000000000034109,PMC10289750,

34526727,Long term dual antiplatelet therapy after myocardial infarction: retrospective analysis in an outpatient population.,"Long term treatment with ticagrelor 60 mg and low-dose aspirin are indicated after acute coronary syndrome (ACS). We retrospectively reviewed aggregate data of 187 patients (155 M and 38 F) (mean age 63.8±9 years) in follow up after ACS with at least one high risk condition (Multivessel disease, diabetes, GFR<60 mL/min, history of prior myocardial infarction, age >65 years) treated with ticagrelor 60 mg twice daily (after 90 mg twice daily for 12 months). The results were compared with findings (characteristics of the patients at baseline, outcomes, bleeding) of PEGASUS-TIMI 54 trial and Eu Label. The highrisk groups were represented as follows: multivessel disease 105 pts (82%), diabetes 63 pts (33%), GFR< 60 mL/min 27 pts (14%), history of prior MI 33 pts (17%), >65 year aged 85 pts (45%). Treatment was withdrawn in 7 patients: 3 cases showed atrial fibrillation and were placed on oral anticoagulant drugs, one developed intracranial bleeding, in three patients a temporary withdrawal was due to surgery (1 colon polyposis and 2 cases of bladder papilloma). Chest pain without myocardial infarction occurred in 16 patients (revascularization was required in 9 patients). Dyspnea was present in 15 patients, but was not a cause for discontinuation of therapy. Long term treatment with ticagrelor 60 mg twice daily plus aspirin 100 mg/day showed a favourable benefit/risk profile after ACS.  In this study all patients had been given ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily for 12 months and the 60 mg twice daily dosage was started immediately thereafter, unlike PEGASUS-TIMI 54 trial in which it was prescribed within a period ranging from 1 day to 1 year after discontinuation of the 90 mg dose. This makes our results more consistent with current clinical practice. However, a careful outpatient follow-up and constant counseling are mandatory to check out compliance to therapy and adverse side effects.",Monaldi archives for chest disease = Archivio Monaldi per le malattie del torace,2021,Monaldi Arch Chest Dis,Ratti Gennaro; Maglione Antonio; Biglietto Emilia; Monda Cinzia; Elettrico Ciro; Ratti Federica; Fulgione Cosimo; Mallardo Mario; Tammaro Paolo,"Cardiology/ICU Department, S.

26529110,Acute Myocardial Infarction Risk in Patients with Coronary Artery Disease Doubled after Upper Gastrointestinal Tract Bleeding: A Nationwide Nested Case-Control Study.,"Prior studies of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are small, and long-term effects of UGIB on AMI have not been delineated. We investigated whether UGIB in patients diagnosed with coronary artery disease (CAD) increased their risk of subsequent AMI. This was a population-based, nested case-control study using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. After propensity-score matching for age, gender, comorbidities, CAD date, and follow-up duration, we identified 1,677 new-onset CAD patients with AMI (AMI[+]) between 2001 and 2006 as the case group and 10,062 new-onset CAD patients without (AMI[-]) as the control group. Conditional logistic regression was used to examine the association between UGIB and AMI. Compared with UGIB[-] patients, UGIB[+] patients had twice the risk for subsequent AMI (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.72-2.50). In the subgroup analysis for gender and age, UGIB[+] women (AOR = 2.70; 95% CI, 2.03-3.57) and patients < 65 years old (AOR = 2.23; 95% CI, 1.56-3.18) had higher odds of an AMI. UGIB[+] AMI[+] patients used nonsignificantly less aspirin than did UGIB[-] AMI[+] patients (27.69% vs. 35.61%, respectively). UGIB increased the risk of subsequent AMI in CAD patients, especially in women and patients < 65. This suggests that physicians need to use earlier and more aggressive intervention to detect UGIB and prevent AMI in CAD patients.",PloS one,2015,PLoS One,Wu Chia-Jung; Lin Hung-Jung; Weng Shih-Feng; Hsu Chien-Chin; Wang Jhi-Joung; Su Shih-Bin; Huang Chien-Cheng; Guo How-Ran,"Department of Emergency Medicine, Chi-Mei Medical Center, Tainan, Taiwan.; Department of Emergency Medicine, Chi-Mei Medical Center, Tainan, Taiwan; Department of Emergency Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Biotechnology, Southern Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Tainan, Taiwan.; Department of Medical Research, Chi-Mei Medical Center, Tainan, Taiwan; Department of Healthcare Administration and Medical Informatics, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.; Department of Emergency Medicine, Chi-Mei Medical Center, Tainan, Taiwan; Department of Biotechnology, Southern Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Tainan, Taiwan.; Department of Medical Research, Chi-Mei Medical Center, Tainan, Taiwan.; Department of Occupational Medicine, Chi-Mei Medical Center, Tainan, Taiwan; Department of Leisure, Recreation and Tourism Management, Southern Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Tainan, Taiwan; Department of Medical Research, Chi Mei Medical Center, Liouying, Tainan, Taiwan.; Department of Emergency Medicine, Chi-Mei Medical Center, Tainan, Taiwan; Department of Occupational Medicine, Chi-Mei Medical Center, Tainan, Taiwan; Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan; Department of Child Care and Education, Southern Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Tainan, Taiwan; Department of Geriatrics and Geronotology, Chi-Mei Medical Center, Tainan, Taiwan.; Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan; Department of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, Tainan, Taiwan.",10.1371/journal.pone.0142000,PMC4631331,

15891266,Antibiotics and risk of first-time hospitalization for myocardial infarction: a population-based case-control study.,"There is increasing evidence that inflammation plays an important role in atherosclerosis. Such inflammation is likely related to the presence of infectious organisms. Hence, we examined whether the use of antibiotic drugs decreases the risk of first-time myocardial infarction (MI). We identified 6737 cases of first-time hospitalization for MI, and 67,364 age- and gender-matched, population-based controls during 1991-2002, using data from the County Hospital Discharge Registry and the Civil Registration System of North Jutland County, Denmark. All prescriptions for antibiotics prior to the hospitalization for MI were identified through a prescription database. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) associated with antibiotic use, adjusted for potential confounding factors including previous discharge diagnoses of hypertension, chronic bronchitis and emphysema, alcoholism, liver cirrhosis, or diabetes mellitus and prescriptions for anti-hypertensive drugs, antidiabetic drugs, lipid-lowering agents, high-dose aspirin, platelet inhibitors, oral anticoagulants, or hormone replacement therapy. The use of any one type of antibiotic in the 3 years before hospitalization was not associated with a decreased risk of MI; the adjusted ORs with corresponding 95% confidence intervals were 1.07, 1.00-1.14 for penicillins; 1.15, 1.00-1.33 for macrolides; 0.95, 0.65-1.39 for tetracyclines; 1.25, 0.84-1.87 for quinolones; and 0.95, 0.80-1.12 for sulfonamides. A slight increase in the risk of MI was seen with the use of more than one type of antibiotic in the preceding 3 years (OR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.09-1.27). Our findings do not support the hypothesis that the use of antibiotics is associated with a lower risk of first-time MI.",American journal of therapeutics,2005,Am J Ther,Monster Taco B M; Johnsen Søren P; Olsen Mette L; Ostergaard Lars; Friis Søren; McLaughlin Joseph K; Sørensen Henrik T,"Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus and Aalborg, Denmark. t.monster@home.nl",,,

11524055,A risk score system for predicting adverse outcomes and magnitude of benefit with glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor therapy in patients with unstable angina pectoris.,"Clinical outcomes of patients with unstable angina are variable. We sought to identify predictors of adverse clinical outcomes in patients with unstable angina and to investigate whether these factors would predict the magnitude of benefit achieved with platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibition. We analyzed 20 variables in the 1,915 patients enrolled in the Platelet Receptor Inhibition for Ischemic Syndrome Management in Patients Limited by Unstable Signs and Symptoms trial. Five independent predictors were identified: age >65 years, prior coronary artery bypass grafting, antecedent aspirin use, antecedent beta-blocker use, and ST depressions on the presenting electrocardiogram. A risk score system was created using these predictors in which patients were assigned 1 point for the presence of each risk factor. There was a progressive increase in the rate of the composite end point of death, myocardial infarction, or refractory ischemia at 7 days with an increasing number of risk factors. For patients treated with heparin alone, the composite end point event rate was 6.5% in the group with 0 or 1 predictor, 14.6% in the group with 2 predictors, 22.7% in the group with 3 predictors, and 37.1% in the group with 4 or 5 predictors (p <0.00001). When dividing patients into low- (0 or 1 point), medium- (2 or 3 points), and high-risk (4 or 5 points) groups, the addition of tirofiban to heparin therapy was associated with no significant benefit in the low-risk group, a 5.2% absolute reduction in the medium-risk group (p = 0.05), and a 16% absolute reduction in the high-risk group (p = 0.0055). Thus, we have developed a risk score system using 5 variables that can be used to identify patients at high risk for death and cardiac ischemic events and who experience the greatest benefit from the addition of a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor to their treatment regimen.",The American journal of cardiology,2001,Am J Cardiol,Sabatine M S; Januzzi J L; Snapinn S; Théroux P; Jang I K,"Division of Cardiology, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02114, USA.",10.1016/s0002-9149(01)01724-6,,

9973029,Fatal cardiac rupture among patients treated with thrombolytic agents and adjunctive thrombin antagonists: observations from the Thrombolysis and Thrombin Inhibition in Myocardial Infarction 9 Study.,"The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence and demographic characteristics of patients experiencing cardiac rupture after thrombolytic and adjunctive anticoagulant therapy and to identify possible associations between the mechanism of thrombin inhibition (indirect, direct) and the intensity of systemic anticoagulation with its occurrence. BACKGROUND Cardiac rupture is responsible for nearly 15% of all in-hospital deaths among patients with myocardial infarction (MI) given thrombolytic agents. Little is known about specific patient- and treatment-related risk factors. METHODS Patients (n = 3,759) with MI participating in the Thrombolysis and Thrombin Inhibition in Myocardial Infarction 9A and B trials received intravenous thrombolytic therapy, aspirin and either heparin (5,000 U bolus, 1,000 to 1,300 U/h infusion) or hirudin (0.1 to 0.6 mg/kg bolus, 0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg/h infusion) for at least 96 h. A diagnosis of cardiac rupture was made clinically in patients with sudden electromechanical dissociation in the absence of preceding congestive heart failure, slowly progressive hemodynamic compromise or malignant ventricular arrhythmias. RESULTS A total of 65 rupture events (1.7%) were reported-all were fatal, and a majority occurred within 48 h of treatment Patients with cardiac rupture were older, of lower body weight and stature and more likely to be female than those without rupture (all p < 0.001). By multivariable analysis, age >70 years (odds ratio [OR] 3.77; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.06, 6.91), female gender (OR 2.87; 95% CI 1.44, 5.73) and prior angina (OR 1.82; 95% CI 1.05, 3.16) were independently associated with cardiac rupture. Independent predictors of nonrupture death included age >70 years (OR 3.68; 95% CI 2.53, 5.35) and prior MI (OR 2.14; 95%, CI 1.45, 3.17). There was no association between the type of thrombin inhibition, the intensity of anticoagulation and cardiac rapture. CONCLUSIONS Cardiac rupture following thrombolytic therapy tends to occur in older patients and may explain the disproportionately high mortality rate among women in prior dinical trials. Unlike major hemorrhagic complications, there is no evidence that the intensity of anticoagulation associated with heparin or hirudin administration influences the occurrence of rupture.",Journal of the American College of Cardiology,1999,J Am Coll Cardiol,Becker R C; Hochman J S; Cannon C P; Spencer F A; Ball S P; Rizzo M J; Antman E M,"Cardiovascular Thrombosis Research Center, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester 01655-0214, USA.

The yearly stroke incidence in NVAF patients is 3-8%, which is 5-7 times higher than that in age-matched persons in sinus rhythm. In five independent studies of stroke prevention in NVAF patients, anticoagulation therapy resulted in a risk reduction of stroke of about 65%. The risk of intracerebral hemorrhage was 0.3% per year during warfarin therapy compared with 0.1% in the placebo group. In one study aspirin reduced the risk of thromboembolic events by 42% while another study found a nonsignificant effect of aspirin. The following variables were identified as risk factors for stroke in the individual studies: prior myocardial infarction, increasing age, mitral annular calcification, history of hypertension, congestive heart failure and previous arterial thromboembolism. A pooled analysis of risk factors in the placebo-treated patients of the five studies is ongoing.",Neuroepidemiology,1993,Neuroepidemiology,Boysen G,"Department of Neurology, Hvidovre Hospital, University of Copenhagen, Denmark.",10.1159/000110329,,
