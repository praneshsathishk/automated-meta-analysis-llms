39674322,"Aspirin modulates generation of procoagulant phospholipids in cardiovascular disease, by regulating LPCAT3.","Enzymatically oxygenated phospholipids (eoxPL) from lipoxygenases (LOX) or cyclooxygenase (COX) are prothrombotic. Their generation in arterial disease, and their modulation by cardiovascular therapies is unknown. Furthermore, the Lands cycle acyl-transferases that catalyze their formation are unidentified. eoxPL were measured in platelets and leukocytes from an atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) cohort and retrieved human arterial thrombi from three anatomical sites. The impact of age, gender, and aspirin was characterized in platelets from healthy subjects administered low-dose aspirin. The role of lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3 (LPCAT3) in eoxPL biosynthesis was tested using an inhibitor and a cell-free assay. Platelets from ASCVD patients generated lower levels of COX-derived eoxPL but elevated 12-LOX-diacyl forms, than platelets from healthy controls. This associated with aspirin and was recapitulated in healthy subjects by aspirin supplementation. P2Y12 inhibition had no impact on eoxPL. LPCAT3 inhibition selectively prevented 12-LOX-derived diacyl-eoxPL generation. LPCAT3 activity was not directly altered by aspirin. P2Y12 inhibition or aspirin had little impact on eoxPL in leukocytes. Complex aspirin-dependent gender and seasonal effects on platelet eoxPL generation were seen in healthy subjects. Limb or coronary (ST-elevation myocardial infarction, STEMI) thrombi displayed a platelet eoxPL signature while carotid thrombi had a white cell profile. EoxPL are altered in ASCVD by a commonly used cardiovascular therapy, and LPCAT3 was identified as the acyltransferase generating aspirin-sensitive 12-LOX diacyl forms.

39195314,Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance and Associated Cardiovascular Outcomes in a Hospital Setting-A Fresh Perspective.,"There is a paucity of data on the cardiovascular implications of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, especially among hospitalized patients. Our study aimed to investigate the association between MGUS and cardiovascular outcomes in a hospital setting using the National Inpatient Sample database. MGUS patients were sampled using ICD-10 codes. The patients were stratified into two cohorts based on the presence or absence of MGUS. Comorbidities and cardiovascular outcomes were collected using ICD 10 DM codes. CV outcomes were evaluated before and after 1:1 matching for age, gender, and race. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis was performed on the matched population, which excluded patients with diabetes mellitus, prior myocardial infarction, chronic kidney disease (stages 3-5), dialysis, hypertension, obesity, metabolic syndrome, cancer, antiplatelets, and oral anticoagulant use and was adjusted for smoking, dyslipidemia, and aspirin use to evaluate the cardiovascular outcomes. MGUS patients had more heart failure, atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolism, aortic aneurysm, aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, mitral stenosis, mitral regurgitation, conduction disorder, cor pulmonale, peripheral vascular disease, and acute myocardial infarction. After matching, MGUS was associated with heart failure, atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolism, aortic stenosis, mitral regurgitation, conduction disorder, cor pulmonale, and peripheral vascular disease. MGUS was linked to a wide spectrum of cardiovascular diseases in an inpatient setting. Further studies are needed to formulate appropriate recommendations for the screening and management of cardiovascular complications in individuals with MGUS.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2024,Curr Oncol,Mustafa Ahmad; Wei Chapman; Araji Ghada; Niazi Muhammad Rafay Khan; Grovu Radu; Weinberg Mitchell; Lafferty James,"Department of Cardiology, Northwell Health/Staten Island University Hospital, Staten Island, New York, NY 10305, USA.; Department of Internal Medicine, Northwell Health/Staten Island University Hospital, Staten Island, New York, NY 10305, USA.; Department of Internal Medicine, Northwell Health/Staten Island University Hospital, Staten Island, New York, NY 10305, USA.; Department of Hematology and Oncology, Northwell Health/Staten Island University Hospital, Staten Island, New York, NY 10305, USA.; Department of Internal Medicine, Northwell Health/Staten Island University Hospital, Staten Island, New York, NY 10305, USA.; Department of Cardiology, Northwell Health/Staten Island University Hospital, Staten Island, New York, NY 10305, USA.; Department of Cardiology, Northwell Health/Staten Island University Hospital, Staten Island, New York, NY 10305, USA.",10.3390/curroncol31080331,PMC11352401,N/A

39161215,Development and Validation of a Nomogram Model for Predicting in-Hospital Mortality in non-Diabetic Patients with non-ST-Segment Elevation Acute Myocardial Infarction.,"Non-ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) is a life-threatening clinical emergency with a poor prognosis. However, there are no individualized nomogram models to identify patients at high risk of NSTEMI who may undergo death. The aim of this study was to develop a nomogram for in-hospital mortality in patients with NSTEMI to facilitate rapid risk stratification of patients. A total of 774 non-diabetic patients with NSTEMI were included in this study. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator regression was used to initially screen potential predictors. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression (backward stepwise selection) analyses were performed to identify the optimal predictors for the prediction model. The corresponding nomogram was constructed based on those predictors. The receiver operating characteristic curve, GiViTI calibration plot, and decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to evaluate the performance of the nomogram. The nomogram model consisting of six predictors: age (OR = 1.10; 95% CI: 1.05-1.15), blood urea nitrogen (OR = 1.06; 95% CI: 1.00-1.12), albumin (OR = 0.93; 95% CI: 0.87-1.00), triglyceride (OR = 1.41; 95% CI: 1.09-2.00), D-dimer (OR = 1.39; 95% CI: 1.06-1.80), and aspirin (OR = 0.16; 95% CI: 0.06-0.42). The nomogram had good discrimination (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.84-0.94), calibration, and clinical usefulness. In this study, we developed a nomogram model to predict in-hospital mortality in patients with NSTEMI based on common clinical indicators.

38914608,Low platelet count at admission has an adverse impact on outcome in patients with acute coronary syndromes: from the START Antiplatelet registry.,"Some previous observations suggest that a low platelet count is associated with an increased risk of adverse outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). However, most of the data come from post-hoc analyses of randomized controlled trials and from studies including thrombocytopenia developed during hospital stay. Our aim was to assess the impact of low platelet count at admission on cardiovascular outcomes and treatment approach in patients hospitalized for ACS in a current real-life setting in Italy. Patients admitted to Italian coronary care units for ACS were enrolled in the START-ANTIPLATELET registry. Baseline clinical characteristics and treatment at discharge were recorded. Patients were followed-up at 6 months, 1 year and yearly thereafter. Low platelet count was defined as a count at admission < 150 > 100 k/µl or < 100 k/µL. Among 1894 enrolled patients, 157 (8.3%) had a platelet count < 150 > 100 k/µl and 30 (1.6%) < 100 k/µl. The median follow-up was 12.3 months (0.4-50.1). patients with low platelets were older (72 ± 10.4 vs 66 ± 12.4 years, p = 0.006), more frequently males (82.9 vs 72.1%, p = 0.001), hypertensive (90.0% vs 70.4%, p = 0.03), with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) (17.1 vs 8.6%, p = 0.02), and peripheral arterial disease (11.5 vs 6.2% p = 0.01) and/or had a previous myocardial infarction (40 vs 18.7%, p = 0.008) and/or a PCI (14.6 vs 7.8%, p = 0.001) than patients with normal platelets. A slightly, but significantly, lower percentage of thrombocytopenic patients were treated with primary PCI (78.1 vs 84.4%, p = 0.04) and they were more frequently discharged on aspirin plus clopidogrel rather than aspirin plus newer P2Y<sub>12</sub> antagonists (51.9 vs 65.4%, p = 0.01). MACE-free survival was significantly shorter in thrombocytopenic patients compared to patients with normal platelets (< 150 > 100 k/µl: 37.6 vs 41.8 months, p = 0.002; HR = 2.7, 95% CIs 1.4-5.2; < 100 k/µl: 31.7 vs 41.8 months, p = 0.01; HR = 6.5, 95% CIs 1.5-29.1). At multivariate analysis, low platelet count, age at enrollment, low glomerular filtration rate, low ejection fraction, a previous ischemic stroke and NVAF were independent predictors of MACE. A low platelet count at admission identifies a subgroup of ACS patients with a significantly increased risk of MACE and these patients should be managed with special care to prevent excess adverse outcomes.",Scientific reports,2024,Sci Rep,Gresele Paolo; Guglielmini Giuseppe; Del Pinto Maurizio; Calabrò Paolo; Pignatelli Pasquale; Patti Giuseppe; Pengo Vittorio; Antonucci Emilia; Cirillo Plinio; Fierro Tiziana; Palareti Gualtiero; Marcucci Rossella,"Department of Medicine and Surgery, Section of Internal and Cardiovascular Medicine, University of Perugia, Strada Vicinale Via Delle Corse, S.

38413716,Antiplatelet therapy prior to COVID-19 infection impacts on patients mortality: a propensity score-matched cohort study.,"One of the major pathomechanisms of COVID-19 is the interplay of hyperinflammation and disruptions in coagulation processes, involving thrombocytes. Antiplatelet therapy (AP) by anti-inflammatory effect and inhibition of platelet aggregation may affect these pathways. The aim of this study was to investigate if AP has an impact on the in-hospital course and medium-term outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The study population (2170 COVID-19 patients: mean ± SD age 60 ± 19 years old, 50% male) was divided into a group of 274 patients receiving any AP prior to COVID-19 infection (AP group), and after propensity score matching, a group of 274 patients without previous AP (non-AP group). Patients from the AP group were less frequently hospitalized in the intensive care unit: 9% vs. 15%, 0.55 (0.33-0.94), developed less often shock: 9% vs. 15%, 0.56 (0.33-0.96), and required less aggressive forms of therapy. The AP group had more coronary revascularizations: 5% vs. 1%, 3.48 (2.19-5.55) and strokes/TIA: 5% vs. 1%, 3.63 (1.18-11.2). The bleeding rate was comparable: 7% vs. 7%, 1.06 (0.54-2.06). The patients from the AP group had lower 3-month mortality: 31% vs. 39%, 0.69 (0.51-0.93) and didn't differ significantly in 6-month mortality: 34% vs. 41%, 0.79 (0.60-1.04). When analyzing the subgroup with a history of myocardial infarction and/or coronary revascularization and/or previous stroke/transient ischemic attack and/or peripheral artery disease, AP had a beneficial effect on both 3-month: 37% vs. 56%, 0.58 (0.40-0.86) and 6-month mortality: 42% vs. 57%, 0.63 (0.44-0.92).

38296575,Pretransfer Aspirin Administration and Its Impact on Angiographic Outcomes for Patients with ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction.,"Although guidelines recommend early aspirin administration after diagnosis of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), the decision of pretransfer aspirin administration is at the discretion of the primary physicians. Therefore, this study aimed to determine whether pretransfer aspirin administration was associated with better angiographical outcomes in patients with STEMI. This study compared the angiographic findings of thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow grade in the infarct-related artery before percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) between patients who received pretransfer aspirin and those who did not. In total, 28 patients (11.2%) were administered aspirin before transfer and 219 (88.8%) were administered aspirin upon arrival at the hospital. Propensity score matching yielded 135 patients [27 patients (20%) who were administered aspirin before transfer and 108 patients (80%) who were administered aspirin upon arrival at the hospital]. Patients who received pretransfer aspirin had a higher rate of TIMI-3 flow before PCI compared to those who did not receive pretransfer aspirin [8 (28.6%) versus 15 (6.8%), P < 0.01, in all study patients; 8 (26.6%) versus 7 (6.5%), P < 0.01, in propensity-score-matched patients]. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that pretransfer aspirin administration was significantly associated with the presence of TIMI-3 flow before PCI, independent of age, gender, transfer time, and statin use (OR: 5.43, 95% CI: 1.94-15.2, P < 0.01, in all study patients; OR: 6.17, 95% CI: 1.86-20.46, P < 0.01, in propensity-score-matched patients). Pretransfer aspirin administration could lead to the early restoration of coronary blood flow in patients with STEMI, supporting its active use in STEMI care.",International heart journal,2024,Int Heart J,Yamada Ryota; Horikoshi Takeo; Nakamura Takamitsu; Uematsu Manabu; Yamaguchi Kazuyuki; Kobayahi Tsuyoshi; Ando Ryota; Yoshizaki Toru; Watanabe Yosuke; Kuroki Kenji; Nakamura Kazuto; Sato Akira,"Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Faculty of Medicine.; Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Faculty of Medicine.; Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Faculty of Medicine.; Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Faculty of Medicine.; Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Faculty of Medicine.; Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Faculty of Medicine.; Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Faculty of Medicine.; Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Faculty of Medicine.; Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Faculty of Medicine.; Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Faculty of Medicine.; Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Faculty of Medicine.; Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Faculty of Medicine.",10.1536/ihj.23-389,,N/A
