Antiplatelet drugs are widely used for the secondary prevention of stroke because antiplatelet therapy has been proven to have larger benefits than risk. [ 1 – 4 ] However, the effects of antiplatelet in primary prevention for cardiovascular events and mortality after stroke have been controversial. [ 5 – 7 ] Results have been varied according to the subjects who were enrolled in the studies, and the recommendation of aspirin was different considering the risk factors for cerebrovascular disease and demographic factors such as sex and age. [ 8 , 9 ]
The effects of prior antiplatelet therapy on functional outcomes and other complications have been studied. [ 10 – 13 ] Some previous researches concluded that antiplatelet therapy was not associated with mortality after ischemic stroke regardless of the timing of morality and all-cause mortality. [ 10 , 11 ] A recent study about the association with stroke severity and prior antithrombotic therapy showed that antiplatelet t"

[ 10 , 11 ] A recent study about the association with stroke severity and prior antithrombotic therapy showed that antiplatelet therapy could decrease initial stroke severity [ 12 ] and infarction volume. [ 14 ]
The primary prevention of aspirin can be expected to be effective in the high-risk groups because the secondary prevention of aspirin has proven its effectiveness. [ 1 – 4 ] However, in the recent primary prevention studies targeting the high-risk groups, the incidence of cardiovascular events was much lower than expected. [ 15 – 19 ] On the other hand, if national-wide retrospective data is used, large-scale data can be used, but it may be vulnerable to immortal or selection biases. [ 20 ] In this study, to avoid these biases, we pooled patients with first-ever hemorrhagic/ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction (MI) with nation-wide data and reconsidered the use of aspirin for the primary prevention by s"

In hemorrhagic stroke, there was no difference when all neurologic disabilities were included (HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.97–1.30; P = .12).

The risk of 90-day mortality after hemorrhagic stroke was highly affected by age: if compared with the risks of the age of fewer than 60 years, 60s (HR 2.21, 95% CI 1.50–3.25; P < .001), 70s (HR 3.63, 95% CI 2.48–5.30; P < .001), those in their 80s (HR 6.69, 95% CI 4.54–9.65; P < .001), and those in their 90s or older (11.28, 95% CI 6.46–19.70; P < .001) significantly increased the risk of the 90-day death (Fig. 2 ). The old age was also a strong risk factor for 90-day mortality after ischemic stroke and MI (data not shown).

4. Discussion
We examined 8770 patients with prior aspirin therapy and matched comparison subjects from a nation-wide cohort database of 3,080,639 Korean populations who were older than 55. By pooling hemorrhagic/ischemic stroke and MI, we could estimate the overall effects of aspirin at the population level. Our results demonstrate that prior aspirin therapy significantly increased severe neurologic disability in hemorrhagic stroke and 90-day and long-term mortality rates in all 3 cardiovascular events. For the 90-day mortality of hemorrhagic stroke, which can be regarded as a direct consequence of hemorrhagic stroke, the old age is the most critical factor.

In this retrospective large-scale cohort study using NHIS data, aspirin therapy had no benefit in the prognosis of cardiovascular events. Antiplatelet drugs showed a beneficial effect on secondary prevention for cardiovascular events but had complications, including bleeding risk. [ 1 – 4 ] Thus, antiplatelets should be prescribed considering the risk and benefit for each individual. A meta-analysis by Antithrombotic Trialists’ Collaboration presented that the primary prevention effect of aspirin on ischemic stroke was insignificant. [ 1 ] Another meta-analysis of randomized trials in 2019 showed that aspirin did not significantly reduce ischemic stroke occurrence in patients without previous cardiovascular event, and aspirin also did not show any beneficial effect on the primary prevention of stroke in patients with diabetes mellitus on previous studies. [ 7 , 10 , "
PMC10289750,PMC10289750_chunk_20,"ients without previous cardiovascular event, and aspirin also did not show any beneficial effect on the primary prevention of stroke in patients with diabetes mellitus on previous studies. [ 7 , 10 , 22 , 23 ] On the other hand, there has been a report of the beneficial primary prevention effect for stroke in women. [ 9 ] Previous studies of the primary prevention effect for ischemic stroke showed conflicting results, and the effects might differ according to subjects’ characteristics such as sex and comorbidities and various study design. It has also been suggested that there might be an ethnic difference in the effect of antiplatelet agents, considering habitual status, including eating, and higher intracerebral bleeding risk in Asian populations. Recently conducted studies in Japan showed no beneficial effect of aspirin for the primary prevention of stroke and death in elderly patients with atherosclerotic risk factors. [ 5 , 24 ]

Our study has several limitations. We used NHIS cohort data with a retrospective study design. Although we matched 2 groups regarding the medical status and socioeconomic factors, there might be more confounding factors. For example, we do not divide stroke type in our analysis, and there might be a difference in the primary prevention effect according to stroke subtype. [ 25 ] In addition, based on our results, although the aspirin group showed an increased risk for mortality, initial stroke severity could be higher compared with the control group considering the mortality rate.
In conclusion, prior aspirin use was no benefit for neurologic disability and short/long-term mortality after cardiovascular events. In 90-day mortality after cardiovascular events, the old age is a critical factor. So far, no benefit has been demonstrated for aspi"

So far, no benefit has been demonstrated for aspirin over placebo in the elderly over 70 years of age, and aspirin increased the risk of bleeding, according to recent randomized clinical trials. [ 15 – 17 ] Since bleeding is much fatal in the elderly, aspirin prescription for primary prevention should be more careful in the elderly.

Despite advancements in therapeutic strategies, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), which encompasses both ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), remains a significant contributor to global morbidity and mortality [ 1 ]. Central to the management of these conditions is percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), typically involving aspirin and an adenosine monophosphate (ADP) P2Y12 receptor antagonist. Although improved treatment strategies for myocardial infarction guided by advanced imaging techniques are enhancing the effectiveness of percutaneous coronary intervention, the inhibition of purinergic receptors on platelets represents a significant advancement in cardiology [ 2 ]. Dual antiplatelet therapy is essential for the long-term successful application of stent implantation during interventional cardiology procedures. The importance of this mechanism is part"

The importance of this mechanism is particularly pronounced in the context of interventions in the prothrombotic environment associated with acute coronary syndrome. However, the selection of P2Y12 inhibitors has been the subject of extensive research and debate [ 3 ]. The TRITON-TIMI 38 study, which evaluated prasugrel, a potent P2Y12 inhibitor, in a predominantly PCI-treated patient population, failed to demonstrate a significant mortality benefit when compared to clopidogrel [ 4 ]. Conversely, the PLATO trial found that ticagrelor significantly reduced mortality in an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) cohort, including those managed medically without PCI [ 5 ]. Adding to the complexity of choice in clinical practice, the ISAR-REACT 5 trial revealed the superiority of prasugrel over ticagrelor in a head-to-head comparison among pa"

Current guidelines reflecting these findings advocate for the use of more potent P2Y12 inhibitors—prasugrel or ticagrelor—especially in patients with high thrombotic risk, whereas clopidogrel is reserved for patients in whom these agents are contraindicated or not available. In addition, current recommendations are permissible for the administration of clopidogrel to patients with high age or bleeding risk (HBR). However, real-world adherence to these recommendations is influenced by multiple factors, including cost, availability, and concerns about increased bleeding risk associated with the use of more potent agents [ 1 , 7 , 8 ].
Clopidogrel remains a key component in DAPT regimens globally, despite a significant decline in its use in the United States in "
PMC11546885,PMC11546885_chunk_4,"eding risk associated with the use of more potent agents [ 1 , 7 , 8 ].
Clopidogrel remains a key component in DAPT regimens globally, despite a significant decline in its use in the United States in the last decade, where its use has decreased from 87.4% to 28.4%. In contrast, clopidogrel-based DAPT maintains a notable presence. Data from the SCAAR registry revealed that clopidogrel is used in 41% of STEMI cases. This indicates that although its usage patterns may vary, clopidogrel continues to be an integral part of DAPT in many regions globally [ 9 , 10 ].
Consequently, in Hungary, as in many other countries, the adoption of potent P2Y12 inhibitors has been gradual, partially because of these considerations. Considering these dynamics, this study examined the clinical outcomes associated with the use of potent P2Y12 inhibitors versus clopidogrel in a contemporary cohort of patients with AMI.

Our database selection criteria focused on AMI cases in which patients underwent coronary intervention during the acute phase of the event and were initiated on DAPT comprising aspirin (ASA) and a P2Y12 receptor antagonist. P2Y12 inhibitors were selected at the discretion of the treating physician. Patients treated with clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor were included in this study.

These clinical events (death, new ischemic events, PCI, and CABG) were tracked and recorded using the National Health Insurance Fund database (NEAK). For the current analysis, outcomes within the first 12 months after the intervention were considered.

2.2. Patient Selection and Clinical Endpoints
Our database selection criteria focused on AMI cases in which patients underwent coronary intervention during the acute phase of the event and were initiated on DAPT comprising aspirin (ASA) and a P2Y12 receptor antagonist. P2Y12 inhibitors were selected at the discretion of the treating physician. Patients treated with clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor were included in this study. Patients who received potent inhibitors, i.e., prasugrel or ticagrelor, were compared to those who received clopidogrel.
The clinical endpoints evaluated in this study included mortality, subsequent myocardial infarction, stroke, and the necessity for repeat revascularization, either through PCI or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). These clinical events (death, new ischemic events, PCI, and CABG) wer"

These clinical events (death, new ischemic events, PCI, and CABG) were tracked and recorded using the National Health Insurance Fund database (NEAK). For the current analysis, outcomes within the first 12 months after the intervention were considered.

Baseline characteristics were summarized using descriptive statistics. Continuous variables are expressed as means with standard deviations (SD) or medians with interquartile ranges (IQR), depending on the normality of the data distribution, whereas categorical variables are presented as frequencies and percentages. Mortality and major adverse events were compared between patients treated with clopidogrel or potent P2Y12-based DAPT using Kaplan–Meier and Cox proportional risk model analyses.

Kaplan–Meier survival curves were generated to illustrate the time-to-event analysis stratified by DAPT type. The log-rank test was used to assess the difference in survival curves. To account for potential confounders and balance potential biases in observational data, propensity score (PS) analysis was performed. A logistic regression model was used to calculate the PS, i.e., the probability of receiving treatment (potent P2Y12 inhibitors), given the covariates listed in Table 1 . The covariates included demographic information, vital signs, clinical characteristics, past medical history, and procedures.
After calculating the PS, the inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was applied using these scores as balancing weights, ensuring that the distribution of observed baseline covariates was independent of treatment assignment. Weighted Cox proportional hazards models were"

Weighted Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the association between treatment and the endpoints. The absolute risk reduction at 1 year (ARR) was used to calculate the number required to prevent an extra adverse event (NNT).
Our study conducted a comprehensive subgroup analysis to assess the comparative effectiveness of potent P2Y12 inhibitors and clopidogrel. Patients were categorized into specific subgroups based on a range of clinical and demographic factors. These categories encompassed age, sex, diabetes, history of stroke, renal function (classified as severe, moderate, or absent chronic kidney disease), type of ACS (being either STEMI or NSTEMI), and HBR status.

For HBR status, both major criteria (such as oral anticoagulant (OAC) use, severe chronic kidney disease, severe anemia) and minor criteria (age over 75 years, moderate chronic kidney disease, moderate anemia, history of stroke) were identified from the database in line with the Academic Research Consortium (ARC) HBR criteria. Patients meeting at least one major or two minor criteria were classified under high bleeding risk. It is important to note that not all 20 criteria outlined in the ARC HBR definition were identifiable in our database [ 1 , 2 ]. Consequently, subgroup analyses were not conducted for patients not categorized as having an HBR. For each subgroup, Cox proportional hazards models were used to compute the hazard ratios (HRs) for 1-year mortality.

A decision curve analysis (DCA) was conducted to evaluate the clinical utility of potent antiplatelet therapy in reducing mortality and MACE. Cox proportional hazards models were fitted, and the predicted risks were calculated for each patient using these models. We also included age as a continuous variable and examined interaction terms between treatment and age to assess potential modifications in treatment effects. Predicted risks from these models were used to create data frames with binary outcomes and predicted risks.

4. Results
Upon filtering the database records, we identified 65,986 patients who underwent PCI and were administered DAPT in response to an ACS event (the record identification process is depicted in Figure 1 ).
Of these patients, 9014 received potent P2Y12 inhibitor-based dual antiplatelet therapy and 56,074 received clopidogrel-based DAPT. There were notable differences in patient characteristics between the two groups ( Table 1 ).

In the unadjusted analysis, the group receiving potent P2Y12 inhibitors exhibited a significantly lower risk of mortality within the first year after myocardial infarction, with an HR of 0.58 (95% CI: 0.54–0.63), compared to those on clopidogrel. ( Figure 3 ). The absolute risk reduction in the first year was 4.75%, indicating that 21 cases needed to be treated to avoid one death. Annual trends showed that the benefits of potent DAPT remained significant alongside the increasing rate of its use. ( Figure 2 B) This finding was consistent with the IPTW analysis, which also showed a lower risk of mortality with an HR of 0.68 (95% CI: 0.65–0.71) for the potent P2Y12 inhibitor group ( Table 2 ).

Similar trends were observed in the incidence of MACE, which is defined as the composite of cardiovascular mortality, MI, and stroke. In the unadjusted model, the potent P2Y12 inhibitor cohort had a lower risk of MACE, with an HR of 0.66 (95% CI: 0.62–0.7) ( Figure 3 ). The risk reduction at the end of the first year was calculated to be 5.57%, with an NNT of 18 to prevent one adverse event. This trend persisted in the IPTW analysis, with an HR of 0.73 (95% CI: 0.70–0.75) for the potent P2Y12 cohort ( Table 2 ).
Both the unadjusted and IPTW model analyses showed that the potent P2Y12 inhibitor group had a significantly lower risk of both myocardial infarction and stroke compared with the clopidogrel group.

The increasing trend of repeat revascularization compared with the lower risk of ischemic events in the potent DAPT group might be explained by the higher rate of procedures with revascularization completion.

Notable benefits were observed, particularly in patients with diabetes. The benefits of potent P2Y12 inhibitors varied across age groups.

In both the unadjusted and IPTW-adjusted models, patients treated with potent P2Y12 inhibitors exhibited a significantly lower risk of myocardial infarction and stroke compared to those receiving clopidogrel.
Upon analyzing the yearly stratified data from 2014 to 2021, a noteworthy observation was the consistently higher survival probability for patients treated with potent P2Y12 inhibitors compared to those receiving clopidogrel. This trend persisted annually, indicating a potentially significant association between potent P2Y12 inhibitor therapy and decreased absolute mortality within the first year after ACS. From 2019 to 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic introduced potential confounding factors affecting healthcare access and patient adherence, and the observed survival benefit persisted [ 16 ].

PMC11546885,PMC11546885_chunk_28,"e COVID-19 pandemic introduced potential confounding factors affecting healthcare access and patient adherence, and the observed survival benefit persisted [ 16 ].
The subgroup analyses of our dataset provide nuanced insights pertinent to the 2023 ESC guidelines for ACS management. This is particularly relevant in the context of clopidogrel use among older patients with ACS and those with HBR. Our data indicate that for patients aged 75–79, the HR for mortality with potent P2Y12 inhibitors versus clopidogrel was 0.82 (95% CI: 0.69–0.96, p = 0.017), and for those aged >80 years, the HR was 0.79 (95% CI: 0.62–0.99, p = 0.044), suggesting significant reductions in mortality risk in both groups. It is noteworthy that the reduction in mortality remained significant even in the oldest age groups, despite the higher baseline mortality rate, which resulted in more avoidable events.

Combined with the DCA results showing that age contributes to risk prediction but does not significantly modify treatment effects, our findings support a uniform approach to antiplatelet therapy across all age groups. This challenges guideline recommendations that favor clopidogrel use in older patients, supporting the broad use of potent antiplatelets to optimize patient outcomes without age-specific adjustments [ 17 , 18 ].
For patients with HBR, the risk reduction implies that potent P2Y12 inhibitors may only provide a slight and statistically non-significant reduction in mortality compared with clopidogrel. This finding supports the guideline’s preference for clopidogrel in patients with HBR given the less clear benefit of potent inhibitors. Conversely, in patients with diabetes, we found that interaction p was highly significant for the diabet"

Conversely, in patients with diabetes, we found that interaction p was highly significant for the diabetes status. This finding in the context of that the HR for mortality with potent P2Y12 inhibitors was 0.45 (95% CI: 0.40–0.50, p < 0.0001), indicating a substantial reduction in mortality risk compared with clopidogrel [ 19 ]. Although the smoker’s paradox and its potential interaction with the P2Y12 inhibitor response in STEMI patients warrant further study [ 20 ], this analysis lacked sufficient data to examine this relationship.
Furthermore, our results showed that patients with a history of stroke had more than twice the mortality rate compared with those without a cerebrovascular accident history. Notably, stroke is a contraindication to prasugrel, and recent stroke within the past six months is a major criterion in the ARC HBR definition [ 21 ]. In patients with a history of stroke, t"

In patients with a history of stroke, the HR was 0.63 (95% CI: 0.47–0.85, p = 0.0020), suggesting that clopidogrel was associated with increased mortality. However, our database lacks complete information to fully implement all ARC HBR criteria, including characteristics other than age, renal function, anemia, and stroke history.
Notably, an increased rate of repeat revascularization was observed in the potent P2Y12 inhibitor group. This increase was primarily attributable to the higher frequency of repeat PCI procedures, whereas the differences in CABG rates did not reach statistical significance. This finding, despite the lower ischemic event rates, may reflect a strategy to ensure complete initial revascularization.

P2Y12 and P2Y1 platelet receptors play critical roles in platelet activation and aggregation, influencing the development of thrombosis and cardiovascular events. The TRITON-TIMI 38 and PLATO trials assessed the efficacy of potent P2Y12 inhibitors in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Additionally, the ISAR REACT-5 trial provided a direct comparison between ticagrelor and prasugrel in patients with ACS undergoing invasive evaluation. Collectively, these studies have demonstrated that potent P2Y12 inhibitors are linked to a reduction in adverse thrombotic outcomes, including cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke. However, it is crucial to note that although the PLATO trial reported a significant mortality benefit, this finding was not observed in patients with ACS treated with prasugrel.

Significantly, the TRITON-TIMI 38 trials identified a ‘core population’ in which prasugrel demonstrated no benefit or potential harm. This population includes patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), as well as those aged >75 years or weighing less than 60 kg. Consequently, prasugrel’s labeling incorporates these findings, listing such cases as contraindications or recommending a lower dosage. This restriction may explain the more favorable outcomes observed with prasugrel in real-world applications than in trial settings. The on-label use of prasugrel, adhering to these specific guidelines, may also account for its superior performance in the ISAR-REACT-5 trial [ 22 ]. Notably, the incidence of stroke following coronary intervention was substantially reduced in patients administered potent DAPT, a trend that persisted and even intensified in "

Notably, the incidence of stroke following coronary intervention was substantially reduced in patients administered potent DAPT, a trend that persisted and even intensified in analyses using IPTW. This finding supports the notion that stronger inhibition of platelet aggregation may effectively prevent stroke [ 23 , 24 ].
The cost and reimbursement policies of potent P2Y12 inhibitors significantly influence treatment decision making. The increasing popularity of de-escalation strategies, which involve switching to clopidogrel or P2Y12 monotherapy, also reflects concerns about the cumulative bleeding risk associated with prolonged potent DAPT [ 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 ]. Annual data analysis indicates a rising trend in the use of potent P2Y12 inhibitors, accompanied by sustained improvement in mortality. Despite the demonstrated benefits of potent P2Y12 inhibitors in reducing thrombotic risks among patients with ACS, their uptake in clinical practice has "

Despite the demonstrated benefits of potent P2Y12 inhibitors in reducing thrombotic risks among patients with ACS, their uptake in clinical practice has been gradual. Concerns regarding increased bleeding risks associated with the use of potent P2Y12 inhibitors are at the forefront of clinical decision making, particularly concerning medication choices at the time of hospital discharge. These risks necessitate a careful balance between reducing thrombotic events and avoiding bleeding complications [ 10 ].

Although statistical techniques like propensity score matching and inverse probability weighting were used to adjust for observed baseline differences between groups, residual confounding from unmeasured or inadequately adjusted factors remains a significant concern. Furthermore, the incomplete capture of all ARC high bleeding risk (HBR) criteria within the dataset limits the robustness and generalizability of findings related to this specific high-risk subgroup.

The study period overlapped with the COVID-19 pandemic. Although efforts were made to account for its effects, potential confounding effects on healthcare access, resource allocation, treatment decisions, and patient outcomes cannot be fully excluded. In addition, the current study was limited by the lack of data regarding changes in P2Y12 therapy in-hospital or follow-up. Thus, we were not able to analyze potential treatment escalations (from clopidogrel to potent P2Y12 inhibitors) or de-escalations after the PCIduring hospitalization. This limitation may influence the interpretation of long-term outcomes.

We performed the numerous post-hoc subgroup analyses that raise the risk of spurious findings due to multiple comparisons. Therefore, the results should be interpreted with caution, and further research, ideally a large-scale randomized controlled trial, is needed to validate these findings and draw more definitive conclusions regarding the optimal choice of antiplatelet therapy in this patient population.
7. Conclusions
In summary, our analysis indicated an association between the administration of potent P2Y12 inhibitors and improved survival in the year following ACS treatment, which was consistent across a seven-year period. This trend persisted even during the COVID-19 pandemic, although the precise implications of the pandemic on these outcomes warrant further analyses [ 32 , 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 ].

The World Health Organization reported that 9 million people died of cardiovascular disease worldwide in 2019, accounting for 16% of the total deaths [ 1 ]. Aside from patients with single‐vessel disease, approximately 40%–65% of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) are diagnosed with multivessel disease (MVD) [ 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ].
Compared to those with single‐vessel disease, patients with MVD have a more severe state of atherosclerosis in the vascular bed and tend to have worse clinical outcomes manifested as a higher cumulative incidence of recurrent atherothrombotic coronary events, revascularization, and adverse mortality [ 5 , 6 , 7 ]. With the increasingly widespread use of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in the treatment of CVD, culprit vessels in MVD patients were effectively treated [ 8 , 9 ].

Abundant evidence from clinical trials demonstrated a significant reduction in the risk of major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs) for 1 year with DAPT treatment relative to aspirin monotherapy following drug‐eluting stent (DES) implantation [ 11 , 12 , 13 ]. However, the duration of antithrombotic therapy for patients with MVD after PCI is still controversial.
The previous randomized controlled trial (RCT), PEGASUS‐TIMI 54, showed a dramatic reduction in the risk of MACCEs in patients with prior myocardial infarction (MI) and MVD treated with prolonged DAPT treatment (60 mg and 90 mg ticagrelor twice daily in patients treated with low dose aspirin) [ 14 ]. In consideration of the higher risk of bleeding due to the po"

In consideration of the higher risk of bleeding due to the potent antiplatelet effect of ticagrelor, clopidogrel, another P2Y12 receptor inhibitor, can reduce net adverse clinical and cerebral events (NACCEs) and bleeding events compared with ticagrelor in a real‐world study [ 14 , 15 , 16 ]. Therefore, clopidogrel‐based DAPT is theoretically more suitable for long‐term antiplatelet therapy among patients with MVD following DES implantation.
Given these, we designed the Dual Antiplatelet Therapy in Patients with Coronary Multi‐Vessel Disease (DAPT‐MVD) trial to evaluate whether extending DAPT with clopidogrel and aspirin for 12 months would improve the long‐term prognosis for MVD patients 12 months after DES implantation.

The DAPT‐MVD trial aims to provide novel insights and robust clinical evidence for managing targeted patients. Given the possibility of increased bleeding risk, it is vital to prudently evaluate the preferable effect of prolonged DAPT [ 17 , 18 ]. Hence, for MVD patients at 12 months after DES implantation, it is essential to weigh the beneficial effects of prolonged DAPT treatment against an increased bleeding risk.
Methods
The DAPT‐MVD study (ClinicalTrials. gov unique identifier NCT04624854 ) is a multicenter, open‐label, randomized, controlled trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of prolonged DAPT treatment in MVD patients beyond 12 months after DES implantation.

In the era of PCI with significant progress, the gap in clinical outcomes between PCI and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) has narrowed over time. Accordingly, it is reported that the number of PCIs performed for MVD increased by 56% per year between 2001 and 2006; moreover, the number of CABG surgeries declined by 24% and subsequently fell at an annual rate of 5% [ 23 ].

However, owing to the presence of high plaque load and extensive ischemia risk, a heightened risk of adverse events remains in MVD patients after administration of contemporary treatment therapies, with a 3.1% cumulative risk of all‐cause death, 1.9% cumulative risk of MI and 0.7% cumulative risk of stroke [ 20 ]. Moreover, whether prolonged DAPT based on 12 months of treatment after PCI is beneficial remains debatable. Despite the high prevalence and mortality of MVD, a paucity of evidence‐based medicine evidence exists regarding optimal DAPT management among particular patients.

The study showed that 1 month of dual antiplatelet therapy was non‐inferior to the continuation of treatment for at least two additional months with regard to the occurrence of net adverse clinical events and major adverse cardiac or cerebral events; abbreviated therapy also resulted in a lower incidence of major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding. This suggests that future research should focus on individualized antiplatelet therapy. Few prospective studies are concentrated on antiplatelet therapy after revascularization in MVD patients.

According to the 2020 ESC Guidelines for the Management of Acute Coronary Syndromes in Patients Presenting without Persistent ST‐segment Elevation , it is recommended for patients with non‐ST‐segment elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE‐ACS) to receive DAPT consisting of aspirin and a P2Y12 receptor inhibitor 12 months following PCI unless there are contraindications (I, A) [ 25 ].

The CHARISMA trial tested the effect of clopidogrel versus placebo on an aspirin background among patients with prior myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or symptomatic peripheral arterial disease. During the follow‐up for a median of 27.6 months, patients with clopidogrel plus aspirin benefited significantly from intensifying antiplatelet therapy compared with the controls. Clopidogrel significantly reduced the risk of MACCE (7.3% vs 8.8%, p = 0.01) and did not significantly increase the risk of severe bleeding (1.7% vs. 1.5%, p = 0.50) [ 26 ].

However, the extension of DAPT increased the risk of bleeding, making the clinical decision‐making process on the optimal duration of DAPT more challenging.

Hemophilia is an X-linked recessive disease due to factor VIII gene mutations. Advances in treatment technologies have reduced the risk of massive bleeding and improved the life expectancy of hemophilia patients. 1 Therefore, hemophilia patients develop atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) at similar rates to the general population. 2 However, the incidence of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and the rates of thrombotic cardiovascular mortality among patients with hemophilia are notably lower. This discrepancy is associated with reduced thrombin generation and intrinsic hypocoagulable condition of hemophilia patients. 3 4 ACS resulting from plaque rupture and thrombotic occlusion may rarely be triggered by an overdose of coagulation factor supplement. 5 6 Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for patients with hemophilia carries a higher risk of major bleeding. 1 Some experts suggest invasive coronary procedures in hemophiliacs with ACS, lacking established guide"

CASE REPORT
A 55-year-old male farmer came to our outpatient clinic presenting resting chest pain for several days. He was a current heavy smoker and a chronic alcoholic for 35 years. He was obese (body weight of 76.1 kg and body mass index of 29.0 kg/m 2 ) and had been taking antihypertensive medications for 5 years. After he was diagnosed with hemophilia A during his military service, he had been receiving subcutaneous injections of coagulation factor VIII (Greenmono™, GC Biopharma, Yongin, Korea). He used to inject additional dose of coagulation factor when he felt arthralgia at both the destructed knees and ankles, as "
PMC11605043,PMC11605043_chunk_3,"tions of coagulation factor VIII (Greenmono™, GC Biopharma, Yongin, Korea). He used to inject additional dose of coagulation factor when he felt arthralgia at both the destructed knees and ankles, as he believed the pain would be relieved by supplement. A chest X-ray and initial electrocardiogram (ECG) showed no specific abnormalities. An echocardiography revealed normal left ventricular function without regional wall motion abnormalities. The levels of cardiac enzyme and B-type natriuretic peptide were within the normal range. Low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol level was elevated at 133 mg/dL. The level of factor VIII was 16%.
Upon consultation with a hematologist, coronary CT angiography (CCTA) instead of invasive coronary angiography (CAG) was performed to rule out angina. CCTA demonstrated a tubular 50% stenosis with soft plaque at the distal segment of the right coronary artery (RCA) ( Fig. 1A to C ).

An esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed a mucosal break suggesting reflux esophagitis ( Fig. 1D ). The patient’s pain was improved with antianginal medications, including molsidomine and carvedilol. He was suspected to have intermediate spastic coronary artery disease or reflux esophagitis and was released after a 6-days stay, prescribed statin and pantoprazole, but without any antiplatelet agents. He had been advised against excessive use of the coagulation factor supplement.
Twenty days later, the patient was brought to our emergency room due to severe squeezing chest pain. He continued to smoke and drink due to heavy farming work, and was administered factor VIII injections up to three times a day to alleviate severe arthralgia.

Due to the patient’s persistent chest pain despite medical management including nitroglycerin, heparin infusion (loading dose of 5000 IU with maintaining dose of 18 IU/hr) and dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) (aspirin 300 mg, clopidogrel 600 mg) were loaded. The minimally invasive CAG intending PCI was performed after a shared decision-making with the patient. Diagnostic CAG via the right radial artery with 4 French sheaths and Judkin catheters showed more than 80% luminal narrowing at the same segment of RCA seen on the prior CCTA. For revascularization, 5 French sheaths and Judkin right guiding catheters were used. Intravascular ultrasound confirmed 90% area stenosis with thrombotic occlusion ( Fig. 3A and B ).

After pre-dilatation with a Genoss balloon™ (3.0×15 mm, Genoss, Suwon, Korea), a bare metal stent (BMS), Integrity™ (4.0×22 mm, Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) was deployed ( Fig. 3C and D ). At the end of the procedure, the activated clotting time was 180 msec, and 5000 IU of heparin was additionally infused. Six days after index PCI, the patient was discharged without any complications. Blood quantification of coagulation factor VIII at admission was high (94 IU/dL).
Six months later, follow-up angiography and intravascular ultrasound showed patent BMS with minimal late loss ( Fig. 3E and F ). Under the conventional supplement, the level of factor VIII was usually varied, ranging between 6% and 49%. Unfortunately, more than 5 years later, the patient passed away from pancreatic cancer.

He had been remaining stable without any clinical events while adhering to a single antiplatelet agent (clopidogrel 75 mg) and conventional hemophilia management with proper arthralgia control. The informed consent for the case report was received from the guardian and the institute review board approved it (No. 202311015-HE001).
DISCUSSION
With increased life expectancy among hemophilia patients, they exhibit multiple risk factors for ASCVD. 1 PCI with DAPT for hemophilia patients with ACS would increase the bleeding risk and presents a therapeutic dilemma due to the lack of experience and evidence. 8
Our patient presented several risk factors for ASCVD and received an overdose of coagulation factor supplement, resulting in ACS. BMS facilitated a shorter duration of DAPT, and no bleeding or thrombotic complications occurred under clopidogrel monotherapy for the rest of his life.

According to the major consensus, invasive interventions and medical therapy in hemophilia patients with ACS should not be deferred, as delayed reperfusion can lead to poor cardiovascular outcomes. 1 7 Although the peak level of clotting factor should be maintained above 80% before PCI, 1 confirming the levels cannot justify delaying interventions for ACS. 8
Following PCI, the proper maintenance of antiplatelet drugs holds significant importance due to stent thrombosis concern. 9 10 Since hemophilia does not involve any platelet abnormalities, DAPT would be utilized without definitive guidance. 8 One month of DAPT was suggested following the placement of BMS, as well as 12 months after implanting a drug-eluting stent (DES). 7 In the DES era, advances in technologies, including very thin-strut, mitigate the duration of "

In conclusion, ASCVD affects hemophilia patients just as it does the general population. It is possible to perform CAG, PCI, and post-procedural management with standards of care while maintaining the usual dose of coagulation factors. Further research to develop specific guidelines concerning PCI in hemophilia patients with ACS would be warranted."
PMC11607373,PMC11607373_chunk_1,"Key Summary Points
Why carry out this study? Aspirin (ASA) is commonly used for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) prevention, but trends in its use across demographic groups and dosages remain insufficiently explored. What was learned from the study? ASA use significantly increased, with more low-dose use and less high-dose use, rising from 2.9 million to 6.6 million users, particularly among women and African Americans. Despite guidelines advising against ASA for primary prevention in older adults without ASCVD, many patients aged ≥ 70 years continue its use, highlighting the need for better education on guideline adherence. The study emphasizes the importance of ongoing monitoring and education on ASA use, particularly among older adults without ASCVD, to improve outcomes and minimize risks.

Introduction
Atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (ASCVDs) are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the USA, with an estimated 800,000 Americans suffering a myocardial infarction (MI) event annually [ 1 ]. The burden accounts for one in four deaths in the USA, incurring an annual burden of $200 billion on the healthcare system [ 1 , 2 ]. Poorly controlled atherosclerotic risk factors and suboptimal use of preventive therapies continue to be prevalent in those with and without atherosclerotic heart disease [ 3 , 4 ]. Historically, multiple societal guidelines have recommended aspirin (ASA) use for primary and secondary prevention of ASCVD [ 5 – 7 ]. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends low-dose ASA for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in adults aged 40 to 59 years with a 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk, while advising against its use for primary CVD prevention in adults aged 60 years or older [ 7 ].

However, recent studies have raised concerns about the risks of bleeding with ASA use in specific high-risk patient populations, which can outweigh the cardiovascular risk reduction [ 8 , 9 ]. The 2019 ACC/AHA (American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association) guidelines [ 10 ]. The ASPREE trial (Aspirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly) found that ASA use in healthy older adults did not prolong disability-free survival and was associated with a significant risk of major hemorrhage [ 9 ]. Similarly, the ARRIVE trial (Aspirin to Reduce Risk of Initial Vascular Events) showed that ASA did not significantly reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events in patients at moderate risk, but increased the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding [ 11 ]. The ASCEND trial (A Study of Cardiovascular Events in Diab"

The ASCEND trial (A Study of Cardiovascular Events in Diabetes) indicated that while ASA reduced the risk of serious vascular events in patients with diabetes, it also increased the risk of major bleeding [ 8 ]. As a result, there has been an overall shift toward an individualized approach to ASA use for the primary prevention of ASCVD. However, the ideal ASA dose was a topic of clinical debate until recently. The Adaptable trial randomized 15,000 patients to high- vs. low-dose ASA and showed no difference in cardiovascular outcomes between the two doses [ 11 ]. Interestingly, in 2014, the National Cardiovascular Data Registry (NCDR) showed that more than 60% of acute MI survivors were discharged on a high dose of ASA, and after that, it continued indefinitely in most of these patients [ 12 ].

PMC11607373,PMC11607373_chunk_5," than 60% of acute MI survivors were discharged on a high dose of ASA, and after that, it continued indefinitely in most of these patients [ 12 ]. In the context of evolving guidelines and recent data, the trends of ASA utilization among the US adult population remain underexplored. Therefore, we performed a 22-year retrospective cohort study of US adults 40 years or older by utilizing the 2000–2021 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) database to determine the overall pattern and changes in the prevalence of ASA use over time. Our goal is to analyze the overall trend and expenditures of ASA use (both 81 mg and 325 mg) in the USA, considering newer guidelines. Additionally, we aim to examine the prevalence of ASA use across different races, income categories, and age groups. This comprehensive approach will provide a clearer understanding of the current landscape of ASA use and its alignment with recent recommendations.

The MEPS currently has three major components: the Household Component (MEPS-HC), the Insurance Component, and the Medical Provider Component (MPC). The MEPS-HC collects data from a sample of families and individuals in selected communities across the USA, drawn from a nationally representative subsample that participated in the previous year’s National Health Interview Survey conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics.

Results
Our study included nearly 53 million weighted US non-institutionalized adults from January 2000 to December 2021. The prevalence of ASA users increased from 2.9 million in 2000–01 to 6.6 million in 2018–19. Table 1 describes the baseline characteristics of our study population by the pooled year groups. The mean age of ASA users remained unchanged throughout the study period (66.5 ± 12.1; p trend = 0.37) whereas the representation of female patients using ASA increased across the study period (36.7% in 2001–02 vs. 49.7% in 2020–21; p trend = 0.02).

There was a steady increase in ASA use among African Americans (13% in 2000–01 to 18.9% in 2018–19; p trend = 0.03), while a decline was noted among White patients (68.4% in 2000–01 to 52.9% in 2018–19; p trend < 0.01). Approximately 50% of our study population was in middle- or high-income groups. The representation of uninsured status amongst ASA users decreased across the study period (4.6% in 2000–01 to 0.7% in 2020–21; p trend < 0.01), while there was no statistically significant difference in the representation of public or private insurance.

While evaluating the predictors of ASA use, we found that female patients had lower odds of ASA use in both cohorts of with and without ASCVD than male patients. Furthermore, residents of Northeastern and Western states had higher odds of using ASA than patients from Southern states. Patients belonging to African American, Hispanic, and Asian/Pacific Islander ethnicity had higher odds of using ASA compared to the White patient population.

Demographic Shifts
Our study included nearly 53 million weighted US non-institutionalized adults from January 2000 to December 2021. The prevalence of ASA users increased from 2.9 million in 2000–01 to 6.6 million in 2018–19. Table 1 describes the baseline characteristics of our study population by the pooled year groups. The mean age of ASA users remained unchanged throughout the study period (66.5 ± 12.1; p trend = 0.37) whereas the representation of female patients using ASA increased across the study period (36.7% in 2001–02 vs"

There was a steady increase in ASA use among African Americans (13% in 2000–01 to 18.9% in 2018–19; p trend = 0.03), while a decline was noted among White patients (68.4% in 2000–01 to 52.9% in 2018–19; p trend < 0.01). Approximately 50% of our study population was in middle- or high-income groups. The representation of uninsured status amongst ASA users decreased across the study period (4.6% in 2000–01 to 0.7% in 2020–21; p trend < 0.01), while there was no statistically significant difference in the representation of public or private insurance.

Trend in Aspirin Use
There has been an uptrend in overall ASA use in adults > 40 years and a proportion of ASA use in subgroups with or without ASCVD ( p trend < 0.01) (Fig. 1 ). The proportion of ASA use in established patients with ASCVD peaked between 2012 and 2015 and has plateaued since, while ASA use for patients without ASCVD continued to increase steadily through the study period. From 2000 to 2021, the low-dose (81 mg) ASA use increased significantly, while the high-dose (325 mg) ASA use decreased (both p trend < 0.01) (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table S2 ). In the ASCVD cohort, ≥ 70-year-old patients were the most prevalent age group with > 50% using ASA, followed by 50–69 years and 40–49 years age groups (Fig. 3 a and Supplementary Table S3 ). ASA use in patients with ASCVD ≥ 70 years decreased after 2008–09 ( p trend < 0.01).

Expenditure Analysis
The average annual total expenditure on ASA was approximately 60 million US dollars (USD). Out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditures averaged 27.3 million USD per year. Both total and OOP expenditures showed an upward trend, reflecting the growing use and cost of ASA therapy in the USA (Fig. 4 and Table 1 ).

Discussion
Our study highlights significant trends in the use of ASA among US adults over the past two decades, revealing both positive and concerning patterns in its utilization. First, there was an increase in overall ASA use and its expenditure along with the subsets of patients with and without ASCVD. Second, low-dose ASA use increased, while high-dose ASA has steadily declined over the past two decades. Third, the prevalence of ASA use has increased among women, and minority racial and ethnic groups. Last, a significant proportion of patients aged ≥ 70 "

Last, a significant proportion of patients aged ≥ 70 years continue to use ASA in both the with and without ASCVD cohorts.
The overall uptrend in ASA use is likely multifactorial, with possible reasons including the increased awareness regarding ASA use for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Recommendations by multiple professional societies favored ASA use until data from recent randomized control trials (RCTs) demonstrated a higher risk of bleeding. In 2002, the USPSTF recommended that clinicians consider ASA use for primary prevention in certain patients at increased risk of cardiovascular disease [ 14 ]. Later, an update released by USPSTF in 2009 consolidated ASA use in men aged 45–79 and women aged 55–79 at high risk for ASCVD [ 15 ].

The 2016 iteration of the guidelines from USPSTF recommended ASA use for primary prevention in those in the 50- to 59-year-old group and 60- to 69-year-old group with elevated cardiovascular risk [ 16 ]. In 2022, the US Preventive Services Task Force recommended considering low-dose ASA for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults aged 40–59 years with high risk, but advises against it for those aged 60 years or older [ 7 ]. Similarly, the Joint Task Forces of the European Society of Cardiology over the years have suggested ASA use for primary prevention in those at an elevated risk [ 17 , 18 ]. However, the ACC/AHA only published guidelines for secondary prevention of ASCVD in 2001 and 2002, emphasizing the importance of secondary preventative interventions, including pharmacological therapy with antiplatelets [ 19 , 20 ].

We noticed a significant increase in ASA use for ASCVD after the study period 2012–2013. This inflection point noted in 2012–2013 was likely due to the increased use of ASA for both primary and secondary prevention. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services implemented the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program to reduce readmissions with certain medical conditions or procedures, including acute myocardial infarction [ 21 ]. Furthermore, the overall care of patients with AMI has improved over the years, even for metrics not part of quality initiatives. Data from the NCDR–Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention Outcomes Network Registry–Get With The Guidelines registry show that the proportion of patients receiving defect-free care for acute MI significantly increased from 66.0% in 2010 to 77.1% in 2017 [ 22 ]"

The temporal change in the population dynamics could be another contributing factor, as improved survival of patients with ASCVD due to advancement in cardiovascular intervention has created a larger population of older adults eligible for secondary prevention over time. The increased ASA use corresponded with changes in overall expenditure related to ASA during the study period from 2012 to 2017.
The shift toward low-dose ASA use is likely multifactorial and has been reported in prior studies [ 11 ]. Observational studies have suggested that low-dose ASA is equally efficacious for primary and secondary ASCVD prevention, and clinical trials have failed to show the superiority of one approach over the other [ 23 , 24 ].

Following this, the European guidelines only recommend low-dose ASA for secondary prevention [ 5 ]. We observed an uptrend in the use of ASA among female patients and African Americans and, interestingly, a decline among White patients. Current literature suggests that African Americans and women are more likely to receive suboptimal CVD prevention than other groups [ 25 , 26 ]. Our study showed that female patients had lower odds of using ASA for both with and without ASCVD, similar to previously reported findings by Boakye et al. [ 27 ]. Such disparities can be attributed to poor awareness, lower utilization of healthcare services, and societal barriers [ 28 ]. Although it is not possible to discern the appropriateness of ASA use in our study, a cross-sectional study by Luepker et al. showed that inappropriate ASA use was noted in at least one in four adu"

Although it is not possible to discern the appropriateness of ASA use in our study, a cross-sectional study by Luepker et al. showed that inappropriate ASA use was noted in at least one in four adults in the upper midwestern area using ASA without an appropriate indication [ 29 ]. Interestingly, overuse was more common among women in this study. In another study by Bazargan et al. that studied the use of ASA among African Americans, 60% of study participants self-prescribed the medication [ 30 ]. As such, despite the recommendations for the nonuse of ASA for primary prevention by multiple professional medical societies, an upward trend in its use among populations traditionally known to have suboptimal healthcare utilization is a cause for concern. Future studies should identify the reasons for this increased use of ASA and the appropriateness of ASA use among these groups.

The increasing trend of ASA use in patients without ASCVD is a cause for concern. Our findings are consistent with multiple prior studies that have shown the use of low-dose ASA for primary prevention to be prevalent [ 27 , 31 ]. A study by Boakye et al. reported increased ASA use in the USA from 1998 to 2009, followed by a nonsignificant decline from 2011 to 2019 [ 27 ]. A study outside of the USA also reported a doubling of ASA use for primary prevention from 2003 to 2017 [ 32 ]. The findings from studies in the USA contrast with the conclusions of a recent Danish study that reported an overall declining trend in ASA use for primary prevention [ 33 ]. Low-cost, over-the-counter availability, perceptions about the therapeutic benefit, decreased awareness of bleeding risk, and direct-to-consumer advertising of ASA could be a few factors for such widespread medication use and self-medication by pat"

Recently, the results of several trials comparing ASA with placebo for primary prevention of ASCVD in patients with diabetes [ 8 ], patients at moderate cardiovascular disease risk [ 11 ], and elderly patients [ 9 ] have shown limited benefit of ASA for ischemic events while significantly increasing bleeding risk. As such, the most recent ACC/AHA guidelines gave a weak recommendation (class IIb) for ASA use for primary prevention among patients aged 40–70 years while also recommending avoiding routine ASA use among adults over 70 years [ 10 ]. The European guidelines have also recommended a similarly conservative approach [ 35 ].

Despite recent evidence of a lack of significant benefit, a study reported that one in four Americans received ASA for primary prevention without an appropriate indication [ 36 ]. Furthermore, the use of ASA for primary prevention continues to be very common among the > 70 age group, with nearly one in two individuals reporting ASA use [ 37 ]. However, the downtrend in ASA use in the ≥ 70-year age group in the patients without ASCVD cohort is reassuring, given the results of recent RCTs and alignment with societal recommendations. The impact of the change in guidelines and recent trials on ASA use for primary prevention in clinical practice will need to be evaluated. This points toward a need for future monitoring of ASA prescription trends, emphasizing provider and patient education on the appropriate and inappropriate use of ASA for primary and secondary prevention.

Conclusions
In this nationally representative retrospective cohort study of non-institutionalized US adults, the use of low-dose ASA increased, and high-dose ASA decreased substantially over the past two decades along with an increase in its total and out-of-pocket expenditure. We noted that ASA use in patients without ASCVD ≥ 70 years remains high, and this needs to be more aggressively targeted by healthcare practitioners. Further studies are required to monitor future ASA trends, focusing on effective strategies for educating healthcare professionals and patients on the appropriate low-dose ASA use for primary prevention.

Idade avançada, presença de SCA, diabetes mellitus, doença renal crônica, características angiográficas e escore de risco isquêmico elevado (SYNTAX 2, GRACE, TIMI, DAPT) devem ser considerados na avaliação da carga isquêmica. Na avaliação de risco de sangramento, devem ser considerados história de sangramento maior, história de acidente vascular cerebral, anemia, diminuição na contagem de plaquetas, doenças malignas, idade avançada, doença hepática grave em uso de anticoagulantes, e elevado escore de risco de sangramento (ARC-HBR, PRECISE-DAPT). A DAPT é prescrita considerando as recomendações das diretrizes atuais, de modo a equilibrar a carga isquêmica, a qual é um indicador de eficácia, e o risco de sangramento, que é um indicador de segurança.

No estudo CURE, que observou os efeitos da dose de AAS quando usado sozinho ou em combinação com clopidogrel em pacientes com SCA, doses mais altas de AAS (>100mg) levaram a taxas mais altas de sangramento e ausência de eficácia adicional. 10 Na doença cardiovascular aterosclerótica, dados atuais recomendam uma dose diária de AAS entre 75 e 100mg. Na França, em um estudo com 380 pacientes, AAS 75mg e clopidogrel, administrados separadamente ou de maneira combinada, melhoraram a adesão medicamentosa do paciente, mas não foram avaliados em termos de eficácia e segurança. 6 Nosso estudo é o primeiro estudo prospectivo, multicêntrico, observacional a investigar a segurança e a eficácia da combinação de doses fixas de AAS (75mg) e clopidogrel (75mg) nesses pacientes.

Em relação aos desfechos primários, a taxa de internação por causas cardiovasculares incluindo insuficiência cardíaca, infarto agudo do miocárdio, trombose de stent e arritmias como fibrilação atrial ou taquicardia ventricular foi de 7,9%. Cronologicamente, o uso de AAS isolado, seguido de DAPT com AAS e clopidogrel, e finalmente AAS com ticagrelor e/ou prasugrel, inibidores mais potentes do receptor para adenosina difosfato P2Y12, mostrou reduzir o risco de eventos isquêmicos no miocárdio em pacientes com SCA. 2 Estudos prospectivos envolvendo pacientes com SCA ou pacientes submetidos à ICP em que a terapia com clopidogrel foi usada mostrou diferenças em termos de desfechos primários.

PMC11739146,PMC11739146_chunk_1,"1 Introduction
Urothelial carcinomas of the bladder are among the fourth most prevalent malignancies among male worldwide, accounting for an estimated 6% of newly diagnosed cancers and 4% of cancer-related mortality ( Siegel et al., 2024 ). Despite the fact that approximately 70%–75% of bladder cancers manifest as non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) ( Lopez-Beltran et al., 2024 ), radical cystectomy constitutes the standard therapeutic approach for multiple, high-grade and/or large-sized NMIBC ( Sim et al., 2019 ; Babjuk et al., 2022 ). Regardless of the standardization of surgical procedures for radical cystectomy and other major surgeries, patients with pre-existing cardiovascular and cerebrovascular conditions remain at considerable risk for severe complications, including acute myocardial infarction ( Babjuk et al., 2022 ; Cathomas et al., 2022 ).

Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) remains the gold standard in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) by re-establishing blood flow to the occluded myocardium through techniques ( He et al., 2022 ), including balloon angioplasty and stent implantation ( Jeger et al., 2020 ). The introduction of drug-eluting stents, which release pharmacological agents like sirolimus and paclitaxel via polymer coatings on bare metal stents, has further augmented the efficacy of PCI by mitigating in-stent restenosis and decreasing the necessity for repeat revascularization procedures ( Fu et al., 2020 ; Suna et al., 2018 ; Giustino et al., 2017 ). However, postoperative dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), consisting of oral aspirin and P2Y12 inhibitor, is recommended post-"

However, postoperative dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), consisting of oral aspirin and P2Y12 inhibitor, is recommended post-PCI to effectively reduce the risk of cardiovascular ischemic events ( Valgimigli et al., 2024 ). But this implement concurrently increases the likelihood of bleeding complications ( Orme et al., 2018 ). The implementation of drug-coated balloons has been shown to potentially reduce the incidence of late stent thrombosis ( Secemsky et al., 2019 ), underscoring the critical necessity for a balanced approach in antithrombotic therapy to effectively prevent both thrombotic and hemorrhagic events.
Contemporary guidelines advise urologists to discontinue anticoagulation therapy during the perioperative period to mitigate the risk of significant intraoperative or postoperative hemorrhage ( Albisinni et al., 2022 ).

However, this strategy may increase the likelihood of intraoperative or postoperative thrombosis, especially in patients with malignancies who also have concomitant cardiovascular or cerebrovascular conditions ( Friedrich et al., 2019 ). Furthermore, patients with malignancies frequently exhibit a hypercoagulable state ( Debergh et al., 2010 ). Researchers indicate that maintaining antithrombotic therapy does not significantly elevate intraoperative blood loss. And it cannot increase perioperative and postoperative transfusion and complication rates ( Furrer et al., 2022 ; Wessels et al., 2019 ). Consequently, it is crucial to meticulously select an antithrombotic therapy strategy tailored to patients with malignancies during the perioperative period.
The rate of perioperative acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in urological surgeries is 0.36% ( Jiang D. D. et al., 2021"

The rate of perioperative acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in urological surgeries is 0.36% ( Jiang D. D. et al., 2021 ) and the in-hospital mortality rates of this condition have reached up to 15.2% ( Devereaux et al., 2011 ). Therefore, it is crucial to receive treatment immediately in case of a perioperative thrombotic event. The application of PCI in conjunction with continued DAPT is fraught with challenges largely due to the risk of possible postoperative hemorrhage.
In this study, we described a 64-year-old male patient with multiple high-grade urothelial carcinomas of the bladder who experienced an acute STEMI on the first postoperative day subsequent to laparoscopic radical cystectomy.

Emergency coronary angiography (CAG) identified significant stenosis ranging from 70% to 90% in the LM, LAD, and LCx arteries, with approximately 90% stenosis observed in the distal RCA ( Figures 2B–D ). The patient subsequently underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), which included drug-coated balloon angioplasty and the deployment of a 3.0 × 23 mm drug-eluting stent extending from the LM to the LAD ( Figure 2E ). Post-procedural CAG confirmed the successful resolution of the stenosis, achieving a Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow grade of 3 ( Figure 2F ). Following PCI, the patient’s myoglobin levels decreased to 1,222.00 ng/mL (normal reference range 28–72 ng/mL) ( Figure 2G ), and D-dimer levels reduced to 1.06 mg/L (normal reference range 0–0.55 mg/L) ( Figure 2H ).

Fortunately, the daily pelvic fluid drainage was limited to 300 mL ( Figure 2I ), and all routine blood indices remained within normal ranges ( Figure 2J ). The combination of antithrombotic therapy and PCI did not result in active bleeding at the surgical site on postoperative day 1 (POD1).

3 Discussion
This case report underscores a significant challenge in the management of patients with high-risk urothelial carcinomas of the bladder who also present with a history of coronary artery disease. The dilemma revolves around the perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy. Discontinuation of this therapy may mitigate the risk of intraoperative and postoperative hemorrhage. However, it concomitantly elevates the risk of potentially fatal myocardial infarctions. The case illustrates that the implementation of rigorous and standardized laparoscopic radical cystectomy with Bricker conduit urinary diversion, followed by postoperative PCI in conjunction with continued DAPT using ticagrelor and a"
PMC11739146,PMC11739146_chunk_36,"lementation of rigorous and standardized laparoscopic radical cystectomy with Bricker conduit urinary diversion, followed by postoperative PCI in conjunction with continued DAPT using ticagrelor and aspirin, can be both safe and effective. Additionally, personalized management of anticoagulant therapy is also essential for patients undergoing major surgical procedures. In situations where the risk of myocardial infarction is heightened, the careful continuation of dual antiplatelet therapy can be warranted, contingent upon stringent adherence to surgical and monitoring protocols. This finding suggests a potential paradigm shift in the management of antithrombotic therapy for high-risk surgical patients, advocating for a tailored approach rather than the routine discontinuation of such therapy.

Patients undergoing surgery for malignancies frequently exhibit a hypercoagulable state, which heightens their susceptibility to thrombus formation, luminal stenosis, and AMI during the perioperative period ( Friedrich et al., 2019 ; Debergh et al., 2010 ). Research indicates that the incidence of perioperative AMI in urological surgeries is 0.36%, with radical cystectomy representing one of the highest risks for AMI complications ( Jiang Y. et al., 2021 ). Moreover, three-vessel coronary artery disease has been identified as a significant predictor of AMI, particularly in elderly patients over 60 years old ( Han et al., 2022 ; Janardhanan et al., 2006 ). In this instance, a 64-year-old patient was identified with significant luminal stenosis in the LM, LAD, LCx, and RCA through preoperative coronary CTA. Based on these findings, it is recommended that elderly patients with established coronary artery disease undergo coronary CTA before major surgical interventions to identify pot"
PMC11739146,PMC11739146_chunk_38,"erative coronary CTA. Based on these findings, it is recommended that elderly patients with established coronary artery disease undergo coronary CTA before major surgical interventions to identify potential contraindications to minimally invasive procedures.
However, although sensitivity and specificity of coronary CTA have improved to 93% and 92%, respectively, the accuracy of coronary CTA in evaluating the severity of a luminal stenosis is still lower than coronary angiography (CAG) ( Nurmohamed et al., 2024 ; Forrest et al., 2023 ). Therefore, in cases where severe stenosis is detected, CAG should be considered to inform decisions regarding perioperative antithrombotic therapy. What is more severe is that the in-hospital mortality rates of perioperative AMI have reached up to 15.2% ( Devereaux et al., 2011 ). Therefore, the effective interventions are of vital importance.

In a propensity-matched cohort of 34,650 patients with perioperative AMI, an invasive approach was associated with lower in-hospital mortality than a conservative approach (8.9% vs. 18.1%; p < 0.001), but it was also associated with increased rates of postoperative hemorrhage ( Smilowitz et al., 2017 ). More recently, a Danish cohort found that 38.5% of patients with perioperative AMI underwent CAG ( Korsgaard et al., 2022 ). And in another study of patients diagnosed with perioperative AMI, only 21% underwent CAG in which 37% receiving some form of revascularization like PCI ( Smilowitz et al., 2017 ). Therefore, a case can be made for the adoption of a more aggressive and invasive management approach in patients with perioperative AMI with high-risk features.

Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent implantation has become the most widely used treatment for coronary artery disease ( Suna et al., 2018 ). For patients with non-cardiac surgery after preoperative PCI, previous studies have demonstrated that the rates of myocardial infarction and cardiac death occurring in these patients were 0.65%–8.09% and 0.22%–0.85%, respectively ( Kang et al., 2024 ; Wang et al., 2024 ; Graham et al., 2018 ). These data were well below the in-hospital mortality rates of perioperative AMI. Meanwhile, the rates of major bleeding were only 1.33%–5.83% ( Kang et al., 2024 ; Wang et al., 2024 ; Graham et al., 2018 ). In summary, we recommended that PCI and antiplatelet therapy should be considered to patients with high-risk cardiovascular diseases before limited-stage or elective non-cardiac surgery.

Active surveillance or conservative management can be performed to monitor the progression of primary diseases during the period of DAPT. Discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy has the potential to increase the risk of major perioperative adverse cardiovascular events, with stent thrombosis being the most feared because of its high associated morbidity and mortality ( Wang et al., 2024 ). The discontinuation of aspirin and other antiplatelet agents should be reserved for patients with high bleeding risk and a comparably low ischemic risk, with procedures performed in PCI-capable hospitals so patients can immediately be treated in case of a perioperative thrombotic event ( Halvorsen et al., 2022 ). And antiplatelet therapy was recommended to be resumed in all these patients no later than 48 h after non-cardiac surgery, unless contraindicated ( Angiolillo, 2024 ). For patients who "

And antiplatelet therapy was recommended to be resumed in all these patients no later than 48 h after non-cardiac surgery, unless contraindicated ( Angiolillo, 2024 ). For patients who are at a moderate-to-high risk of cardiovascular events, the continuation of antiplatelet therapy is recommended during the perioperative period ( Wang et al., 2024 ; Douketis et al., 2012 ).
Atherosclerosis in its initial stages is marked by the presence of non-calcified plaques (NCP) and mixed plaques comprising extracellular lipids and fibrous tissue. NCPs are more commonly observed in male smokers and exhibit a higher propensity for rupture and thrombosis, which can precipitate acute coronary syndrome ( Al-Muhaidb et al., 2021 ). Researchers have demonstrated that non-calcified obstructive coronary artery plaques, which are independently positive associated with the duration of smoking, are identified as an independent risk factor for adverse cardiovascular events, including AM), withi"

D. et al., 2021 ; Miller et al., 2023 ). This patient had a prolonged history of smoking, and the preoperative coronary CTA revealed the presence of NCP in the LCx and RCA, thereby categorizing him as high-risk for perioperative AMI. Coronary CTA proves to be a valuable tool for detecting such plaques and assessing the severity of luminal stenosis, which facilitates improved perioperative risk management ( Meah et al., 2022 ).
Previous research has demonstrated that the continuation of antiplatelet therapy with aspirin during the perioperative period of non-cardiac surgery does not significantly elevate the risk of intraoperative blood loss, transfusion rates, or perioperative complications ( Wessels et al., 2019 ; Furrer et al., 2022 ; Albisinni et al., 2022 )"

However, there is a paucity of data regarding the continuous use of DAPT with aspirin in combination with ticagrelor or clopidogrel during this period. In this instance, the patient underwent PCI and was administered DAPT comprising aspirin and ticagrelor within 24 h postoperatively. Despite this intervention, routine blood tests and pelvic drainage metrics remained stable within normal limits throughout the hospitalization period, and no blood transfusion was necessitated. These observations suggest that DAPT can be safely managed in similar clinical scenarios.

Ticagrelor is among the latest antiplatelet agents utilized to inhibit platelet aggregation by blocking the ADP receptors of the P2Y12 subtype ( Kilic et al., 2018 ). Tirofiban, a well-established GPIIb/IIIa receptor antagonist, has demonstrated efficacy in enhancing coronary blood flow and myocardial reperfusion during emergency PCI in patients with STEMI ( Peng and Li, 2022 ). Research indicates that tirofiban effectively inhibits the release of serotonin and thromboxane A2 from platelets, thereby mitigating vasoconstriction and facilitating distal coronary vasodilation.

Empirical evidence indicates that the concomitant use of ticagrelor and tirofiban enhances coronary recanalization rates and mitigates the occurrence of no-reflow or slow blood flow during PCI, without a significant increase in adverse reactions ( Li et al., 2022 ; Peng and Li, 2022 ). In this particular case, the patient was administered DAPT comprising ticagrelor and aspirin, in addition to intravenous tirofiban post-PCI, thereby demonstrating the safety and efficacy of this antithrombotic strategy.
For patients experiencing AMI, particularly during the perioperative period, the implementation of appropriate antithrombotic therapy is crucial to mitigate the risk of recurrent thrombotic events.

This preference is due to their superior efficacy in reducing thrombotic risk, particularly during the early stages of acute coronary syndrome ( Casula et al., 2024 ; Morrow et al., 2009 ; Jobs et al., 2024 ). Several randomized trials have demonstrated that potent P2Y12 inhibitors are associated with a higher risk of bleeding compared to clopidogrel ( James et al., 2011 ). However, the majority of bleeding events in acute coronary syndrome occur during the maintenance phase, which is more than 1 month after DAPT and PCI ( Turgeon et al., 2020 ; Andell et al., 2015 ). Consequently, these findings have informed a strategy of tapering the intensity of DAPT over time, wherein potent P2Y12 inhibitors are administered during the acute phase of acute coronary syndrome, and clopidogrel is utilized during the chronic treatment period ( Kim et a"

In a multicenter, non-inferiority randomized trial, for patients with stable acute myocardial infarction who did not experience major ischemic or bleeding events within 1 month post-PCI, switching from ticagrelor to clopidogrel could significantly reduce bleeding risk without increasing the incidence of ischemia or recurrent thrombotic events have been demonstrated ( Turgeon et al., 2020 ). In this particular patient, no hemorrhagic complications were observed with DAPT using ticagrelor and aspirin 1 month following urological surgery and PCI. This observation is consistent with previous studies, thereby supporting the safety of perioperative DAPT. Subsequently, ticagrelor was transitioned to clopidogrel, based on evidence indicating that this switch mitigates the risk of bleed"

Subsequently, ticagrelor was transitioned to clopidogrel, based on evidence indicating that this switch mitigates the risk of bleeding without elevating the incidence of ischemic events ( Turgeon et al., 2020 ). This case illustrates that DAPT with ticagrelor and aspirin constitutes a safe and effective antithrombotic regimen for patients during the perioperative period.
A notable limitation of this study was the patient’s refusal to undergo CAG, despite the presence of multiple coronary luminal stenoses identified on coronary CTA. This refusal may have been a contributing factor to the occurrence of perioperative STEMI on postoperative day 1 (POD1). This study underscores the critical importance of performing CAG in patients with significant coronary artery disease prior to major surgery to optimize perioperative management and mitigate the risk of such complications.

4 Conclusion
In this study, PCI in conjunction with DAPT utilizing ticagrelor and aspirin was demonstrated to be a safe and efficacious antithrombotic strategy for postoperative AMI during the perioperative period. Meanwhile, the implementation of a rigorous and standardized laparoscopic radical cystectomy with Bricker conduit urinary diversion provides a structured approach to a challenging scenario. These findings suggest a potential paradigm shift in the management of antithrombotic therapy for high-risk surgical patients. We advocate for considering the continuation of antithrombotic therapy, particularly DAPT, during the perioperative period of major surgical procedures, provided that appropriate precautions are implemented."

Also, there is a large predominance of males in the ASCVD groups, as would be expected due to the demographics of this disease. Due to this, in some groups there were insufficient females for statistical analysis. For comparison of the impact of aspirin, we also looked at males alone, noting that all females were on aspirin and so it was not possible to analyze this group. In contrast the healthy cohort subjects were all between 20 and 50 years old and are expected not to be post menopausal. Here, separate comparisons between male and female subjects were possible both on and off aspirin supplementation.

MRM transitions for 48 platelet eoxPL were analyzed for platelets from the healthy cohort ( 40 ), while for the clinical samples and clots, where both platelets and white blood cells were analyzed, an MRM list that comprised all the known HETE-PL isomers was used. This is because these cells will also make eoxPL from 15- and 5-LOX, which are not present in platelets. For many of the platelet MRM list, due to the absence of full structural information and synthetic standards, names are annotated only in part as putative structures, by omitting the position of hydroxyl group or the specific oxygenated functional group, and they are presented as area of analyte:internal standard (A/IS, cps).

LC/MS/MS of 12-HETE and TXB2
Platelet lipid extracts from healthy subjects were analyzed for 12-HETE and TXB2 using LC/MS/MS. However, since samples had already been extracted for analysis, this was a post hoc estimate, meaning that IS (5 ng of each of 12S-HETE- d8 and TXB2- d4 (Cayman Chemical)) were added after lipid extraction. Thus, variability in extraction efficiency would not be accounted, and data are expressed as A/IS (area, cps). Also, insufficient volumes of all samples were available due to prior assays, and so only a subset of 14 samples were measured. Samples were processed on a C18 Spherisorb ODS2, 5 μm, 150 × 4.6-mm column (Waters, Hertfordshire, UK) using a gradient of 50%–90% B over 10 min (A, water:acetonitrile:acetic acid, 75:25:0.1; B, MeOH:acetonitrile:acetic"

Statistical analysis
LC/MS/MS data were exported from Analyst v1.6.3 (Sciex) and analyzed using MultiQuant v3.0.3 (Sciex). Statistics and bioinformatics used the coding environment R (Open source, version 3.5.3; www.r-project.org ). For heatmaps, mean values (ng/ml or cell number) were log10 transformed and plotted as intensity values using the Pheatmap package with lipid hierarchical clustering. Each lipid was annotated, using a color code, according to its presumed enzymatic origin ( 42 ).

For paired samples, paired t test was used, where data were determined using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to be normally distributed ( socscistatistics.com ), or Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test where it was not. Basal samples were not included in statistical comparisons of activated samples since eoxPL were rarely detected without activation.

Statistical analysis of the clinical cohort was mainly performed on data combined from both biological sexes.

Due to this, in some groups there were insufficient females for statistical analysis. For comparison of the impact of aspirin, we also looked at males alone, noting that all females were on aspirin and so it was not possible to analyze this group. In contrast the healthy cohort subjects were all between 20 and 50 years old and are expected not to be post menopausal. Here, separate comparisons between male and female subjects were possible both on and off aspirin supplementation.
Results
HETE-PL were quantified in platelets from patients with ACS, CAD, and RF basally and then following thrombin activation. The most abundant PE and PC species previously detected in platelets were measured using LC/MS/MS, specifically four PEs and two PCs with 18:0, 18:1, or 16:0, including both plasmalogen and acyl forms.

Five HETE positional isoforms (5-, 8-, 11-, 12-, and 15-) of these were quantified ( 10 ). Little or no HETE-PL were detected basally; however, thrombin stimulated large increases, particularly the abundant 12-HETE-PL species formed via 12-LOX ( 10 ) ( Fig. 1 A). Other HETE-PL also were formed on activation, mainly 15- and 11-HETE-PL but also very low levels of 8-HETE-PL, while 5-HETE-PL were below limit of detection ( Fig. 1 B, C, supplemental Fig. S2 A). Briefly, 12-HETE-PL were formed at significantly higher levels in activated platelets from all patient groups, than HC ( Fig. 1 A). The increase in 12-HETE-PL was due to higher levels of the three diacyl-12-HETE-PL, with no significant differences for plasmalogens ( Fig. 1 D–F, supplemental Fig. S2 B–D).

In contrast, 15- and 11-HETE-PL were significantly reduced in activated platelets from all groups compared to HC ( Fig. 1 B, C). Here, both plasmalogen and acyl-forms of HETE-PEs, and PCs were impacted equally ( supplemental Figs. S2 E–J, S3 A–E). Subsequently, 8-HETE-PL in activated platelets were not different for patient groups versus HC ( supplemental Fig. 2 A). Overall, this indicates that diacyl-eoxPL from 12-LOX are significantly higher in patient groups, while both acyl and plasmalogen 15- and 11-HETE-PL species are reduced.

Although patient numbers in some groups were relatively low, a significant suppressive effect of aspirin on both 11- and 15-HETE-PL generation was clearly observed, while for participants not on aspirin in the HC, RF, and CAD groups, there were no significant differences ( Fig. 1 G–J). Aspirin supplementation was also associated with a significant increase in 12-HETE-PL levels in the RF + CAD groups ( Fig. 1 "
PMC11754521,PMC11754521_chunk_75,", RF, and CAD groups, there were no significant differences ( Fig. 1 G–J). Aspirin supplementation was also associated with a significant increase in 12-HETE-PL levels in the RF + CAD groups ( Fig. 1 K), while for participants not on aspirin, there was no impact of disease ( Fig. 1 L). Next, the individual isoforms of 12-HETE-PL in the RF + CAD groups were measured. In the case of 12-HETE-PL, two of the three diacyl isoforms were significantly increased in platelets by aspirin supplementation, while for all plasmalogens, there was no effect ( supplemental Fig. S3 F). Last, since all female RF and CAD patients were on aspirin, to test the effect of gender, males only were compared. As seen above, aspirin significantly increased platelet generation of diacyl 12-HETE-PL for RF + CAD males ( supplemental Fig. S4 ). In contrast, reductions in 11- and 15-HETE-PL were seen for both acyl and plasmalogen forms in CAD and RF groups, with many PCs in the aspirin groups being below LOQ of our assa"

In contrast, reductions in 11- and 15-HETE-PL were seen for both acyl and plasmalogen forms in CAD and RF groups, with many PCs in the aspirin groups being below LOQ of our assay, and not quantifiable ( supplemental Fig. S5 ). These data indicate that altered platelet eoxPL generation in ASCVD is driven by aspirin. This idea will be further tested in a healthy cohort, later. Using clinical data, eoxPL generation by platelets was also compared to either medication use (anticoagulants, P2Y12 inhibitors, and statins) or other diseases (diabetes, hypertension), but no correlations were noted.
Next, HETE-PL levels were analyzed in leukocyte isolates obtained from patients and healthy control subjects both basally and after ionophore activation, to determine the capacity of the cells to generate them. Generation of eoxPL by ionophore-activated leukocytes was demonstrated, particularly in healthy control samples ( Fig. 2 A). However, levels of eoxPL were lower than in p"

However, levels of eoxPL were lower than in platelets, with a higher degree of samples falling below assay LOQ for individual molecular species. Several HETE-PL formed on activation, mainly 15-, 12-, or 5-HETEs, with 11-HETE-PL being generated at very low levels ( Fig. 2 A, D–F, supplemental Figs. S6 and S7 ). Overall, total 5-HETE-PL (when normalized to leukocyte numbers) generated by 5-LOX showed a small nonsignificant trend to elevate in all groups ( Fig. 2 A, supplemental Fig. 6 A). When cell counts for the patient groups were compared, a significant increase was seen for ACS versus RF for both total white cells and neutrophils ( Fig. 2 B, C). Thus in vivo, the amounts of 5-HETE-PE generated overall may be further elevated due to the higher cell counts. Generation of several 15, 12, or 11-HETE-PL species were significantly decrea"

Generation of several 15, 12, or 11-HETE-PL species were significantly decreased in patient groups, versus HC ( Fig. 2 D–F, supplemental Figs. S6 B, S7 ). We next examined if this finding was associated with drug treatments or coexisting conditions. While there were no significant differences seen for P2Y12 inhibitors (although not many patients were on these drugs), aspirin was associated with a small increase in 15-HETE-PL but no changes for 11-, 12-, or 5-HETE-PEs ( Fig. G, supplemental Fig. S8 A). Last, there were no associations with statins, hypertension or diabetes seen. Fig. 2 12-, 11-, and 15-HETE-PL in ionophore-activated leukocytes are lower in patients with ASCVD than healthy controls.

To further test the impact of aspirin on platelet eoxPL, we turned to a healthy cohort. Previously, in platelets from three unrelated healthy human donors, we found that ∼100 eoxPL were generated acutely on thrombin activation ( 40 ). Some of these were already structurally characterized eoxPL, but many remain incompletely annotated with only partial structural information, eg specifying the chain length, number of rings/double bonds, and oxygenation ( 40 ). Taking this further, we expanded the study up to 28 subjects (50:50 male:female), to test the impact on eoxPL generation of (i) aspirin, (ii) gender, and (iii) seasonality. Subjects first provided a baseline blood sample following a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug washout, and the generation of the 48 most abundant eoxPL was measured ( 40 ). Lipids were putatively assigned as either COX-1 or "

Lipids were putatively assigned as either COX-1 or 12-LOX-derived based on known sources of free oxylipins in platelets, eg 12-HETE (12-LOX), or DiEHEDA (COX-1) ( 45 ). We also considered oxylipins containing 20:4;3O as being likely prostaglandins, e.g. PGE 2 , which are known to be generated in eoxPL forms by platelets ( 46 ). Across the panel, 38 out of 48 lipids were significantly elevated on thrombin activation ( Fig. 3 A). Next, to analyze the impact of aspirin on thrombin stimulation of eoxPL generation, platelets were obtained after 1 week on 75 mg/day aspirin in the same individuals. Most lipids we had proposed to originate from COX-1 were significantly suppressed ( Fig. 3 B, orange markers). This data confirm the enzymatic origin of putative COX-1 derived eoxPL.

The 12-HETE-containing eoxPL increased following aspirin supplementation, although this did not reach significance ( Fig. 3 B, blue markers). When analyzed for gender differences, the median diacyl 12-HETE-PL were consistently elevated in males following aspirin treatment, although this was only significant for PC 18:1_12-HETE ( supplemental Fig. S8 B, C). In contrast, aspirin had no discernible effect on diacy-12-HETE-PL generation in females ( supplemental Fig. S9 A). This small increase in diacyl-12-HETE-PL in males is similar to that seen in the clinical cohort, further supporting the idea that it relates to aspirin. Unfortunately, plasmalogen forms of 12-HETE-PL were below LOQ for these samples and could not be compared. The small elevations of diacyl-12-HETE-PL could result from either higher generation of free 12-HETE or increased rates of esterifica"

The small elevations of diacyl-12-HETE-PL could result from either higher generation of free 12-HETE or increased rates of esterification of 12-HETE into lysoPL, by ACSL/LPLAT enzymes ( 33 ). To test this, levels of 12-HETE and TXB2 were analyzed in activated samples, however while TXB2 generation was suppressed around 95% by aspirin, there was no elevation in free 12-HETE for either males or females ( Fig. 3 C, supplemental Fig. S9 B). This suggests that esterification of 12-HETE to form diacyl, but not plasmalogen-HETE-PL is enhanced by aspirin, supporting our observations in the cardiovascular cohort earlier.

Next, the influence of gender (in the absence of aspirin) was tested, and a trend toward reduced generation of several eoxPL in platelets from males was found, although following Bonferroni correction, these differences became not significant ( Fig. 3 D). The most affected lipids were either from LOX or unknown pathways, suggesting a lower overall thrombin response in males. Those that were reduced included two diacyl-12-HETE-PL (from LOX, PC 18:1a_12-HETE, and PC 16:0a_12-HETE) with two others being plasmalogen-PEs, PE 18:0p_20:5,O, and PE 18:1p_20:4,2O.

Gender differences in platelet reactivity were previously described and will be summarized in the Discussion.
The interindividual variability of platelet eoxPL, when repeatedly sampled over time, is unknown. To test this, a subgroup of healthy volunteers (7 males and 7 females) returned at two subsequent two monthly intervals to provide additional samples pre- and post-aspirin. When subjects were not on aspirin, generation of eoxPL from COX/LOX were up to 2.5-3-fold higher the following spring, a relatively modest fluctuation ( Fig. 4 A). In contrast, most lipids assigned as “unknown” did not show any seasonal variation ( Fig. 4 A).

To assess biochemical relatedness of eoxPL molecular species, specifically, whether lipids showed behavior consistent with common biochemical/enzymatic origins, correlation plots were generated using the data from the first sampling time point (n = 28, basal, thrombin, ± aspirin supplementation). Here, groupings aligned with Sn -2 fatty acyl oxylipin structure strongly ( Fig. 4 C). For example, PEs containing HETEs, HDOHEs, or other monohydroxy lipids clustered together in"

For example, PEs containing HETEs, HDOHEs, or other monohydroxy lipids clustered together in groups. Briefly, 12-HETE-PC formed a separate cluster, indicating influence of the headgroup on biochemical behavior. COX-1 eoxPL correlated closely but were very distinct from other lipids, most likely due to the selective impact of aspirin. There were no negative correlations since all lipids either correlated positively or not at all. These data suggest that eoxPL are generated in groups based on common enzymatic pathways, and this will be explored next.
Aspirin supplementation in the clinical cohort demonstrated a complex regulation of platelet eoxPL, with 12-LOX-derived diacyl forms being selectively elevated, while COX-1 derived forms were reduced ( Fig. 1 ). These data, along with our correlation analysis ( Fig. 4 C) suggest a complex biochemical network whereby structurally relate"

These data, along with our correlation analysis ( Fig. 4 C) suggest a complex biochemical network whereby structurally related eoxPL maybe formed via specific isoforms of ACSL/LPLATs via Lands cycle ( 33 ). However, to date, no information are available on which isoforms generate eoxPL in primary cells.
A strong candidate in platelets for supporting esterification of HETEs is LPCAT3 (LPLAT12 ( 34 ), MBOAT5) since this is specific for 18:2 and 20:4 and can use lysoPC, lysoPE, and lysoPS as substrates ( 34 , 47 , 48 , 49 , 50 ). Mice deficient in LPCAT3 do not survive to adulthood, so obtaining their platelets was not possible. An LPCAT3 inhibitor, (R )-HTS-3, recently became available, so this was tested in human platelets from three unrelated healthy donors ( 37 ). This compound has been shown to be inactive toward the related enzymes, LPCAT1 and LPIAT1, indicating some selectivity ( 37 ). Not only HETE-PL, but "

This compound has been shown to be inactive toward the related enzymes, LPCAT1 and LPIAT1, indicating some selectivity ( 37 ). Not only HETE-PL, but a wider group of previously identified platelet eoxPL were measured using LC/MS/MS, including additional COX-1 products, monohydroxy forms of longer chain PUFA (20:5, 22:3, 22:4, and 22:5) and nonenzymatic platelet products (5- and 8-HETE-PL) ( 40 ). The data suggest that LPCAT3 is required for generation of diacyl-12-HETE-PC and PE ( Fig. 5 A). However, plasmalogen-PE forms were less inhibited by (R )-HTS-3. Strikingly, COX-1-derived eoxPL and those containing longer chain n3 PUFA were not or only slightly affected ( Fig. 5 A). These data suggest that LPCAT3 selectively esterifies 12-HETE into eoxPL in platelets, showing a strong preference for acyl forms of lysoPL over plasmalogens.

Since in vivo aspirin supplementation elevated the levels of eoxPL that were shown here to be generated in an LPCAT3-dependent manner, we next examined the effect of aspirin on LPCAT3 activity directly. Here, human LPCAT3 was tested in the presence of 1 mM aspirin. Microsomal fractions of CHO cells overexpressing human LPCAT3 were used as an enzyme source. Aspirin did not affect LPCAT activity of LPCAT3 ( Fig. 5 B, C). Together, these data suggest that aspirin does not directly affect LPCAT3 and that the selective regulation of diacyl-12-HETE-PL generation by aspirin may instead relate to changes in LPCAT3 expression, expression or activity of upstream ACSLs, or levels of substrates available.

Next, to study in vivo generated eoxPL, arterial thrombi from patients were analyzed, comparing three anatomical sites: carotid, limb, and STEMI. Clots surgically obtained from patients were homogenized, lipids extracted, and HETE-PL measured using LC/MS/MS, followed by hydrolysis of fatty acyls and analysis of HETEs for chirality to confirm enzymatic origin. Briefly, 12-HETE from platelet 12-LOX, 15-HETE from leukocyte 15-LOX, and 5-HETE from neutrophil 5-LOX should be primarily S , while 15-HETEs from COX-1 can be either R or S ( 51 , 52 ). The 11-HETE generated by COX-1 is predominantly R ( 51 , 53 ).
Although the thrombi were from a small group of patients with differences due to age, demographics, and clinical background, there were clear eoxPL signatures seen that related to anatomical site. In carotid clots, 15-, 11-, and 5-HETE-PL were the prominent eoxPL with lower levels of 12- and 8-HETEs. This suggested white cells as the main source of eoxPL ( Fig. 6 A). "

This suggested white cells as the main source of eoxPL ( Fig. 6 A). Chiral analysis of carotid clot lipids showed that 12-, 15-, and 5-HETEs were all slightly more prominent as S isomer forms (55%–60%) while both 8- and 11-HETEs were around 50% S/R . Coupled with the higher levels of 15-HETE-PL versus 12- or 8-HETE-PL, we suggest that 15-HETE-PL originates from both leukocyte 15-LOX ( S ) and COX ( S/R ), while some of the 5-HETE-PL is from neutrophil 5-LOX ( S ) ( Fig. 6 B). The other HETE-PL, 12-, 8-, and 11- may be nonenzymatically derived. There was notable absence of 12-HETE-PL in carotid clots, suggesting little or no platelet involvement ( Fig. 6 A). In contrast, STEMI and limb clots were characterized by higher levels of 12-, followed by 15-, and 11-HETE-PL, then lower amounts of 5- and 8-HETE-PL.

This indicated a platelet signature, largely dominated by 12-LOX (12-HETE-PL) with some COX-1-derived eoxPL (11-, 15-HETE-PL). As confirmation, limb and STEMI clots contained around 95% 12 S -HETE ( Fig. 6 B). In limb clots, 11-HETE was around 75% the R isomer, consistent with COX-1, although in STEMI, it was around 50% ( Fig. 6 B). Subsequently, 8-HETE in limb and STEMI clots was around 75% or 60% R ( Fig. 6 B). Although nonenzymatic oxidation would predict 50% S/R for 8-HETE, a similar predominance of the R enantiomer in serum from clotted blood was previously shown ( 53 , 54 ), and 8 R -HETE is a known side product of platelet 12-LOX ( 55 ). In limb and STEMI clots, 5-HETE-PL were relatively low in comparison to other positional isomers and were around 50%–60% S isomer ( Fig. 6 B). Thus, they may be primarily nonenzymatic, with a small "

Thus, they may be primarily nonenzymatic, with a small involvement of neutrophil 5-LOX. Notably, clots contain large amounts of hemoglobin which could directly contribute to nonenzymatic oxidation, either in vivo or during lipid extraction, despite inclusion of antioxidants and metal chelators.

This demonstrated separation of the STEMI and limb embolectomy samples in the PC1 direction (responsible for 65% of the variance) ( Fig. 6 D). The loadings plot demonstrates that the HETE-PL lipids most responsible for this separation in PC1 are three containing 12-HETE, namely two diacyl and one plasmalogen ( Fig. 6 E).

Five HETE positional isoforms (5-, 8-, 11-, 12-, and 15-) of these were quantified ( 10 ). Little or no HETE-PL were detected basally; however, thrombin stimulated large increases, particularly the abundant 12-HETE-PL species formed via 12-LOX ( 10 ) ( Fig. 1 A). Other HETE-PL also were formed on activation, mainly 15- and 11-HETE-PL but also very low levels of 8-HETE-PL, while 5-HETE-PL were below limit of detection ( Fig. 1 B, C, supplemental Fig. S2 A). Briefly, 12-HETE-PL were formed at significantly higher levels in activated platelets from all patient groups, than HC ( Fig. 1 A). The increase in 12-HETE-PL was due to higher levels of the three diacyl-12-HETE-PL, with no significant differences for plasmalogens ( Fig. 1 D–F, supplemental Fig. S2 B–D).

In contrast, 15- and 11-HETE-PL were significantly reduced in activated platelets from all groups compared to HC ( Fig. 1 B, C). Here, both plasmalogen and acyl-forms of HETE-PEs, and PCs were impacted equally ( supplemental Figs. S2 E–J, S3 A–E). Subsequently, 8-HETE-PL in activated platelets were not different for patient groups versus HC ( supplemental Fig. 2 A). Overall, this indicates that diacyl-eoxPL from 12-LOX are significantly higher in patient groups, while both acyl and plasmalogen 15- and 11-HETE-PL species are reduced.

In contrast, in both the RF and CAD groups, a small number were not on aspirin allowing direct comparison within these groups. Although patient numbers in some groups were relatively low, a significant suppressive effect of aspirin on both 11- and 15-HETE-PL generation was clearly observed, while for participants not on aspirin in the HC, RF, and CAD groups, there were no significant differences ( Fig. 1 G–J).

When cell counts for the patient groups were compared, a significant increase was seen for ACS versus RF for both total white cells and neutrophils ( Fig. 2 B, C). Thus in vivo, the amounts of 5-HETE-PE generated overall may be further elevated due to the higher cell counts.

While there were no significant differences seen for P2Y12 inhibitors (although not many patients were on these drugs), aspirin was associated with a small increase in 15-HETE-PL but no changes for 11-, 12-, or 5-HETE-PEs ( Fig. G, supplemental Fig. S8 A).

Characterizing the impact of aspirin and gender on eoxPL generation by human platelets from healthy volunteers
To further test the impact of aspirin on platelet eoxPL, we turned to a healthy cohort. Previously, in platelets from three unrelated healthy human donors, we found that ∼100 eoxPL were generated acutely on thrombin activation ( 40 ).

Some of these were already structurally characterized eoxPL, but many remain incompletely annotated with only partial structural information, eg specifying the chain length, number of rings/double bonds, and oxygenation ( 40 ). Taking this further, we expanded the study up to 28 subjects (50:50 male:female), to test the impact on eoxPL generation of (i) aspirin, (ii) gender, and (iii) seasonality. Subjects first provided a baseline blood sample following a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug washout, and the generation of the 48 most abundant eoxPL was measured ( 40 ). Lipids were putatively assigned as either COX-1 or 12-LOX-derived based on known sources of free oxylipins in platelets, eg 12-HETE (12-LOX), or DiEHEDA (COX-1) ( 45 ). We also considered oxylipins containing 20:4;3O as being likely prostaglandins, e.g. PGE 2 , which are known to be generated in eoxPL forms by platelets ( 46 ). A"

We also considered oxylipins containing 20:4;3O as being likely prostaglandins, e.g. PGE 2 , which are known to be generated in eoxPL forms by platelets ( 46 ). Across the panel, 38 out of 48 lipids were significantly elevated on thrombin activation ( Fig. 3 A). Next, to analyze the impact of aspirin on thrombin stimulation of eoxPL generation, platelets were obtained after 1 week on 75 mg/day aspirin in the same individuals. Most lipids we had proposed to originate from COX-1 were significantly suppressed ( Fig. 3 B, orange markers). This data confirm the enzymatic origin of putative COX-1 derived eoxPL. The 12-HETE-containing eoxPL increased following aspirin supplementation, although this did not reach significance ( Fig. 3 B, blue markers). When analyzed for gender differences, the median diacyl 12-HETE-PL were consistently elevated in males following aspirin treatment, although this was only significant for PC 18:1_12-HETE ( supplemental Fig. "
PMC11754521,PMC11754521_chunk_134,"alyzed for gender differences, the median diacyl 12-HETE-PL were consistently elevated in males following aspirin treatment, although this was only significant for PC 18:1_12-HETE ( supplemental Fig. S8 B, C). In contrast, aspirin had no discernible effect on diacy-12-HETE-PL generation in females ( supplemental Fig. S9 A). This small increase in diacyl-12-HETE-PL in males is similar to that seen in the clinical cohort, further supporting the idea that it relates to aspirin. Unfortunately, plasmalogen forms of 12-HETE-PL were below LOQ for these samples and could not be compared. The small elevations of diacyl-12-HETE-PL could result from either higher generation of free 12-HETE or increased rates of esterification of 12-HETE into lysoPL, by ACSL/LPLAT enzymes ( 33 ). To test this, levels of 12-HETE and TXB2 were analyzed in activated samples, however while TXB2 generation was suppressed around 95% by aspirin, there was no elevation in free 12-HETE for either males or females ( Fig. 3 "
PMC11754521,PMC11754521_chunk_135,"of 12-HETE and TXB2 were analyzed in activated samples, however while TXB2 generation was suppressed around 95% by aspirin, there was no elevation in free 12-HETE for either males or females ( Fig. 3 C, supplemental Fig. S9 B). This suggests that esterification of 12-HETE to form diacyl, but not plasmalogen-HETE-PL is enhanced by aspirin, supporting our observations in the cardiovascular cohort earlier.

Next, the influence of gender (in the absence of aspirin) was tested, and a trend toward reduced generation of several eoxPL in platelets from males was found, although following Bonferroni correction, these differences became not significant ( Fig. 3 D). The most affected lipids were either from LOX or unknown pathways, suggesting a lower overall thrombin response in males. Those that were reduced included two diacyl-12-HETE-PL (from LOX, PC 18:1a_12-HETE, and PC 16:0a_12-HETE) with two others being plasmalogen-PEs, PE 18:0p_20:5,O, and PE 18:1p_20:4,2O. None of these were impacted by aspirin in either males or females, indicating they are not generated by COX-1. However, when subjects were on aspirin, this small gender effect was attenuated ( Fig. 3 E).

In contrast, most lipids assigned as “unknown” did not show any seasonal variation ( Fig. 4 A).

EoxPL correlate based on Sn-2 oxylipin composition
To assess biochemical relatedness of eoxPL molecular species, specifically, whether lipids showed behavior consistent with common biochemical/enzymatic origins, correlation plots were generated using the data from the first sampling time point (n = 28, basal, thrombin, ± aspirin supplementation). Here, groupings aligned with Sn -2 fatty acyl oxylipin structure strongly ( Fig. 4 C). For example, PEs containing HETEs, HDOHEs, or other monohydroxy lipids clustered together in groups.

A strong candidate in platelets for supporting esterification of HETEs is LPCAT3 (LPLAT12 ( 34 ), MBOAT5) since this is specific for 18:2 and 20:4 and can use lysoPC, lysoPE, and lysoPS as substrates ( 34 , 47 , 48 , 49 , 50 ). Mice deficient in LPCAT3 do not survive to adulthood, so obtaining their platelets was not possible. An LPCAT3 inhibitor, (R )-HTS-3, recently became available, so this was tested in human platelets from three unrelated healthy donors ( 37 ). This compound has been shown to be inactive toward the related enzymes, LPCAT1 and LPIAT1, indicating some selectivity ( 37 ).

The data suggest that LPCAT3 is required for generation of diacyl-12-HETE-PC and PE ( Fig. 5 A). However, plasmalogen-PE forms were less inhibited by (R )-HTS-3. Strikingly, COX-1-derived eoxPL and those containing longer chain n3 PUFA were not or only slightly affected ( Fig. 5 A). These data suggest that LPCAT3 selectively esterifies 12-HETE into eoxPL in platelets, showing a strong preference for acyl forms of lysoPL over plasmalogens.

Aspirin did not affect LPCAT activity of LPCAT3 ( Fig. 5 B, C).

Lipidomics demonstrates higher levels of platelet eoxPL in human arterial limb and coronary (STEMI), than carotid thrombi
Next, to study in vivo generated eoxPL, arterial thrombi from patients were analyzed, comparing three anatomical sites: carotid, limb, and STEMI. Clots surgically obtained from patients were homogenized, lipids extracted, and HETE-PL measured using LC/MS/MS, followed by hydrolysis of fatty acyls and analysis of HETEs for chirality to confirm enzymatic origin. Briefly, 12-HETE from platelet 12-LOX, 15-HETE from leukocyte 15-LOX, and 5-HETE from neutrophil 5-LOX should be primarily S , while 15-HETEs from COX-1 can be either R or S ( 51 , 52 ). The 11-HETE generated by COX-1 is predominantly R ( 51 , 53 ).

Although the thrombi were from a small group of patients with differences due to age, demographics, and clinical background, there were clear eoxPL signatures seen that related to anatomical site. In carotid clots, 15-, 11-, and 5-HETE-PL were the prominent eoxPL with lower levels of 12- and 8-HETEs. This suggested white cells as the main source of eoxPL ( Fig. 6 A). Chiral analysis of carotid clot lipids showed that 12-, 15-, and 5-HETEs were all slightly more prominent as S isomer forms (55%–60%) while both 8- and 11-HETEs were around 50% S/R . Coupled with the higher levels of 15-HETE-PL versus 12- or 8-HETE-PL, we suggest that 15-HETE-PL originates from both leukocyte 15-LOX ( S ) and COX ( S/R ), while some of the 5-HETE-PL is from neutrophil 5-LOX ( S ) ( Fig. 6 B).

The other HETE-PL, 12-, 8-, and 11- may be nonenzymatically derived. There was notable absence of 12-HETE-PL in carotid clots, suggesting little or no platelet involvement ( Fig. 6 A). In contrast, STEMI and limb clots were characterized by higher levels of 12-, followed by 15-, and 11-HETE-PL, then lower amounts of 5- and 8-HETE-PL. This indicated a platelet signature, largely dominated by 12-LOX (12-HETE-PL) with some COX-1-derived eoxPL (11-, 15-HETE-PL). As confirmation, limb and STEMI clots contained around 95% 12 S -HETE ( Fig. 6 B). In limb clots, 11-HETE was around 75% the R isomer, consistent with COX-1, although in STEMI, it was around 50% ( Fig. 6 B).

Although nonenzymatic oxidation would predict 50% S/R for 8-HETE, a similar predominance of the R enantiomer in serum from clotted blood was previously shown ( 53 , 54 ), and 8 R -HETE is a known side product of platelet 12-LOX ( 55 ). In limb and STEMI clots, 5-HETE-PL were relatively low in comparison to other positional isomers and were around 50%–60% S isomer ( Fig. 6 B). Thus, they may be primarily nonenzymatic, with a small involvement of neutrophil 5-LOX. Notably, clots contain large amounts of hemoglobin which could directly contribute to nonenzymatic oxidation, either in vivo or during lipid extraction, despite inclusion of antioxidants and metal chelators.

Discussion
How procoagulant membranes of blood cells are altered in cardiovascular disease is poorly understood, along with how they contribute to thrombotic risk, and also their involvement in formation of human clots in situ. Previously, eoxPL were shown to be elevated in blood cells from patients with venous thrombosis, and are procoagulant in vitro and in vivo ( 56 ). However, up to now, their formation in ASCVD has not been investigated. Herein, using lipidomics, we characterized eoxPL in human ASCVD in blood cells and retrieved clots, as well as in platelets from a healthy cohort. In ASCVD patients, platelet eoxPL generation showed complex changes that primarily were associated with aspirin supplementation, findings which were then confirmed in a healthy cohort.

Complex impacts of aspirin on eoxPL generation were uncovered that can be summarized as follows: (i) inhibition of COX-1 derived eoxPL generation, (ii) elevation of Lands cycle-dependent diacyl-12-HETE-PL generation in platelets, via LPCAT3, (iii) abrogation of gender and seasonal impacts on eoxPL generation in healthy volunteers. These data show that aspirin’s impact on bleeding/thrombosis may move beyond platelet aggregation blockade, into modulation of membrane-dependent coagulation. How eoxPL modulation by aspirin impacts thrombotic risk via coagulation in humans in health and disease warrants further study.
Our study found that LPCAT3 mediates diacyl-12-HETE-PE/PC generation in platelets, providing the first direct evidence of a specific acylation enzyme forming eoxPL. Up to now, the particular Lands cycle enzymes catalyzing oxylipin esterification have remained unknown. The expression and activity o"

Up to now, the particular Lands cycle enzymes catalyzing oxylipin esterification have remained unknown. The expression and activity of LPCAT3, and other LPAT isoforms in platelets is currently unknown and requires further study. The lack of involvement of LPCAT3 in esterification of 11- or 15-HETEs generated by COX-1 suggests there maybe compartmentalization of 12-HETE-PL biosynthetic enzymes within platelets, specifically phospholipaseA 2 , 12-LOX, ACSL, and LPCAT3. This is further supported by our previous observations that exogenously-added 12-HETE- d8 is not esterified into eoxPL following acute platelet activation to form 12-HETE- d8 -PE, in place of endogenously-generated 12-HETE ( 10 ). Also, the lack of esterification of monohydroxy-oxylipins from longer chain unsaturated PUFA by LPCAT3 is consistent with the known substrate preference of this enzyme for 20:4.

Low-dose aspirin increased platelet generation of diacyl 12-HETE-PL. Although this could be due to increased availability of arachidonate substrate when COX-1 is inhibited ( 57 ), free 12-HETE generation by platelets was not elevated by aspirin in the healthy cohort, and only eoxPL which we found are formed by LPCAT3 were affected. This indicates that generation of eoxPL is also controlled at the level of esterification, suggesting LPCAT3 is somehow modulated by aspirin indirectly. Further studies are needed to determine the mechanism. In contrast, inhibition of COX-derived eoxPL by aspirin is expected to be due to direct inhibition of the enzyme. No difference in eoxPL generation was seen for the small number of patients on P2Y12 inhibitors. This receptor is the target of ADP activation of platelets, and we previously found that ADP is una"

This receptor is the target of ADP activation of platelets, and we previously found that ADP is unable to induce 12-HETE generation by platelets providing a potential explanation for this finding ( 58 ).
As 12-HETE-PL are the most quantitatively abundant positional isomers of HETE-PL, the overall impact of aspirin appears to result in higher total levels of platelet eoxPL in platelets from patients taking this drug. Importantly, resting platelets contain little or no eoxPL, with these lipids being generated following agonist challenge. This means that, in vivo, while a patient is otherwise healthy, eoxPL in the circulation should be very low, unless a challenge occurs, eg through trauma, infection, or plaque rupture. Where 12-LOX-derived lipids are elevated by aspirin, they could potentially antagonize the antithrombotic impact of thromboxane A2 (TXA 2 ) inhibition, through promoting th"

Where 12-LOX-derived lipids are elevated by aspirin, they could potentially antagonize the antithrombotic impact of thromboxane A2 (TXA 2 ) inhibition, through promoting the procoagulant impact of the platelet membrane. The clinical impact of aspirin has always been considered to be primarily via its antiplatelet effects, not via modulation of coagulation per se. In support, washed platelets from patients on aspirin therapy still mount a procoagulant phenotype in vitro ( 59 , 60 , 61 ). However, this does not exclude that eoxPL may influence coagulation under the conditions under which they are generated within the complex milieu of a thrombus in vivo. In line with this, a strong signature of platelet derived eoxPL was seen in retrieved human STEMI and limb clots, although it is not known at what stage of thrombus formation they were generated (eg early or late).

Agreeing with the proposed role of these lipids in driving arterial coagulation in vivo, Alox15 −/− mice, which lack many eoxPL, generated smaller thrombi in an arterial model of AAAs ( 15 ), and higher levels of eoxPL are associated with prothrombotic autoimmunity ( 8 ). Furthermore, we previously showed that both Alox15 −/− and Alox12 −/− mice form smaller venous thrombi in vivo and have a hemostatic defect that can be corrected using eoxPL administration ( 15 ).
Leukocyte generation of eoxPL was also modulated in patients with arterial disease, specifically increased neutrophil 5-HETE-PL were detected, combined with moderate reductions in other isoforms. Decreased 11- and 15-HETE-PE could result from inhibition of white cell COX-1 by aspirin; however, due to the small patient numbers a clear effect was not obvious, and also, 15-HETE-PL in leukocytes can also come from eosinophil 1"

In white blood cell (WBC) samples, a likely source of 12-HETE-PL is platelet-leukocyte aggregates, since human WBC do not generally express 12-LOX. These are elevated in ASCVD, and aspirin can dampen their formation ( 62 , 63 ). Overall, the detailed reasons for WBC eoxPL changing in disease are not clear and require further study.
To test our hypothesis that aspirin regulated eoxPL in ASCVD, we next analyzed samples from a healthy cohort. Here, complex gender and seasonal differences in platelet eoxPL formation were seen. First, platelets from females tended to mount a stronger response to thrombin in relation to eoxPL formation.

This finding agrees with numerous previous studies showing that platelets from females aggregate more robustly to several agonists in vitro ( 64 , 65 , 66 ). The rather small gender difference was largely abrogated by aspirin supplementation, suggesting that it may somewhat rely on secondary activation triggered by TXA 2 . A second gender difference was seen for LPCAT3-dependent formation of diacyl 12-HETE-PL, which tended to be elevated in males by aspirin, but not females. This mirrored the significant elevations in males in the clinical cohort and showing a gender-specific effect of aspirin on a subgroup of eoxPL by human platelets.

We note that in our clinical cohort, the small number of females would be expected to be post menopausal, while in the health cohort, they were all younger than age 50. Last, the relative expression of LOX, COX, and LPATs in males versus females is unknown.
Unexpectedly, while most eoxPL were relatively stable across the three sampling periods, COX-1 and LOX derived eoxPL steadily increased throughout, peaking in spring. Although only a relatively small increase of 1.5–3 fold, it was consistently observed for ∼15 individual lipid species. The seasonal change for COX-1-derived eoxPL was blunted by aspirin. The basis of this fluctuation is unknown, and we found no reports of seasonal variation in platelet activities in the literature.

Unfortunately, a fourth sample per patient was not obtained during the study period and so eoxPL generation could not be followed further. Although samples were in storage for different times, we do not expect this to have selectively led to changes in only some eoxPL versus others as storage time was overall less than a year.
We previously used chiral chromatography to evidence the direct enzymatic involvement of LOX enzymes in generating platelet and Th2 macrophage eoxPL ( 10 , 11 ). Taking this further, here, limb or STEMI clots were characterized by a strong platelet eoxPL signature, while white cell or nonenzymatic eoxPL dominated the composition of carotid thrombi.

For instance, carotid clot may be contaminated by significant amount of plaque lipid relative to clot. This is due to the nature of the surgical extraction technique which may also explain the lower total amounts of oxPL. Consistent with this, a predominance of 15-HETE-PL was seen in carotid samples which may originate from macrophages/foam cells in plaque lesions ( 67 ). Free 15-HETE has previously been reported as a component of human carotid plaques, but was deemed to be nonenzymatically generated ( 68 ). Our chiral analysis agrees with this, since it indicated relatively similar proportions of S and R stereoisomers in carotid plaque. This is consistent with studies examining the enantiomeric composition of hydroxyoctodecadienoic acids within advanced atherosclerotic plaques ( 69 ).

The physiological age of the analyzed clots may also contribute differences. STEMI clots were retrieved within a short time from formation (<3 h) compared to carotid clots (days/weeks). Thus, the 12 S -HETE-PL dominant profile in STEMI clots may relate to an acute burst of platelet activation in the first few hours of thrombosis, compared to the carotid clots where time has passed since formation which allows for clot metabolism to take place by the generation of an organized fibrin scaffold, modification to the cellular components and possible PL degradation ( 70 , 71 , 72 ). This could also contribute to higher observed amounts of HETE-PL seen owing due to a level of inflammatory cell activation in the acute phase ( 73 ). Clots collected from limb embolectomies varied in retrieval time (“age”), and this may explain the mixed picture observed in the multivariate analysis where despite an overall "

Clots collected from limb embolectomies varied in retrieval time (“age”), and this may explain the mixed picture observed in the multivariate analysis where despite an overall similar profile to STEMI, at least two of the “oldest” clots were behaving in a way closer to carotid clots. Other factors that may explain the variability include interindividual variability, comorbidity profile, medications, or lifestyle choices. However, the current sample size is not sufficiently powered to investigate this in depth.

Conclusions
In summary, procoagulant eoxPL generation is altered in platelets and leukocytes from patients with ASCVD, potentially contributing to thrombotic risk. Aspirin is the most widely prescribed drug globally for secondary vascular prevention ( 75 , 76 ), with its primary effect being inhibition of the platelet lipid, thromboxane A2 (TXA 2 ) ( 77 ). Clinically, aspirin is generally used as an antiplatelet agent in arterial disease, versus anticoagulants like warfarin which predominate clinically in venous thrombosis ( 78 ). Here, aspirin but not P2Y12 inhibitors had a complex and selective impact on eoxPL generation in both health and disease, thus its influence on the procoagulant membrane needs to be considered.

• Through retrospective analysis of critically ill patients in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database, it was found that statin use could potentially reduced the risk of death in patients in intensive care units (ICUs).
• Compared with other statins, simvastatin had the highest reduction of mortality among patients in the ICU.
• In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, acute kidney injury, sepsis, or myocardial infarction, statin use was associated with reduced 28-day mortality, while the association of statin use and 28-day mortality did not differ according to sex.
What is known and what is new?
• Statins can lower blood cholesterol levels and prevent cardiovascular events in patients with cardiovascular disease.

Introduction

PMC11833575,PMC11833575_chunk_3,"commonly referred to as statins, have traditionally been used for the purpose of reducing blood cholesterol levels or preventing cardiovascular events in patients diagnosed with cardiovascular disease ( 1 ). Approximately 200 million patients are treated with this drug globally. These agents impede the activity of the pivotal enzyme in cholesterol synthesis, thereby diminishing cholesterol production. Simultaneously, they enhance the expression of cell surface low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, accelerating the catabolism of serum LDL. Consequently, statins markedly lower levels of serum total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and apolipoprotein B (ApoB); moderately decrease serum triglyceride (TG) levels; and elevate high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels ( 2 ).

These multifaceted effects on the vascular endothelium include immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and antithrombotic activity ( 3 - 5 ). These non-lipid-related benefits, termed the “pleiotropic effect”, may enhance the prognosis of patients across various diseases ( 6 ), even extending potential benefit to patients with noncardiovascular conditions such as cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and rheumatoid arthritis ( 7 ). The immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects of statins have garnered significant attention in recent years, leading to their investigation as a host-directed therapy for the treatment of infectious diseases ( 8 ).

Concerning anti-inflammatory activity, the growing incidence of sepsis and related fatalities necessitates the further development of therapeutic interventions. In animal models of sepsis ( 9 , 10 ), statins demonstrated inhibitory effects on inflammatory mediators, potentially by disrupting isoprenoid intermediates in the mevalonate pathway. This interference allows for the upregulation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) inhibitors, inhibiting NF-κB-dependent inflammation. Statins also mitigate the cellular damage associated with endotoxins and exotoxins, reverse renal tubular hypoxia, and directly impact the renal vascular system, potentially ameliorating the acute kidney injury (AKI) induced by sepsis ( 11 , 12 ).

PMC11833575,PMC11833575_chunk_6,"ence of fungal infections has exhibited a substantial rise with the administration of immunosuppressive agents, radiotherapy for neoplasms, in vivo tube placements, and extended stays in intensive care units (ICUs). Statins have demonstrated antifungal efficacy and can synergistically enhance the effectiveness of antifungal medications ( 13 ). The possible pathway mechanisms for this effect involve, first, the inhibition of farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) production in the mevalonate pathway by statins, which impedes ergosterol biosynthesis, a crucial component in fungal cell membranes ( 14 ). Second, statins may suppress the isoprenylation pathway, hindering the activation of vital cellular proteins involved in cellular respiration and iron metabolism ( 15 , 16 ). Third, statins may induce fungal mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis. Finally, the statin-induced blockade of HMG-CoA reductase can dampen fungal spore germination ( 17 ).

As it relates to antithrombotic activity, venous thromboembolism, including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, represents a frequent complication in critically ill patients, correlating with substantial morbidity and mortality. Cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36), a single-chain glycoprotein expressed on various cell surfaces, binds to platelet membrane CD36, initiating endogenous reactive oxygen species production and causing platelet activation and thrombosis ( 18 ). Statins can exert inhibitory effects on platelet activation and aggregation either through direct interaction with CD36 or by modulating the intracellular signaling pathway of CD36, among other pathways.

Patients in the ICU have a high incidence of complications such as cardiovascular diseases, severe infection, and thrombosis, and almost all patients in the ICU experience systemic inflammatory response syndromes, leading to a high mortality rate ( 19 ). Investigating the potentially advantageous pleiotropic effects of statins in the ICU setting could potentially yield substantial benefits for clinical practice and public health. We employed a population subset from a comprehensive public critical care database to examine the correlation between statin usage and 28-day all-cause mortality among adult patients in the ICU.

Notably, the prevalence of severe liver disease was lower in the statin group than in the nonstatin (0.9% vs. 5.9%), underscoring hepatotoxicity as a principal adverse effect of statins (see Table 1 ). After PSM, a significant reduction in SMDs between the two groups was observed. Prior to PSM adjustment, most covariates exhibited imbalances between the statin group and nonstatin group; after PSM, the SMD for all covariates was <0.10, indicative of balanced inclusion of covariates between the two groups ( Figure S1 ).

Population
A total of 76,540 records documenting ICU hospitalizations were retrieved from the MIMIC-IV database. From this dataset, 53,150 patient records pertaining to the initial ICU admission were meticulously selected. Following the exclusion of patients due to age or incomplete data, a final cohort of 50,624 individuals was formed, comprising 15,630 statin users and 34,994 nonusers. PSM analysis was executed, as illustrated in Figure 1 .

Comparative analysis of baseline characteristics revealed that individuals in the statin group exhibited an advanced age and a higher proportion of males compared to their non-statin-treated counterparts (62.0% vs. 53.1%); the statin group also had a higher percentage of Medicare recipients (50.2% vs. 39.5%) and elevated rates of concurrent aspirin usage (70.8% vs. 18.2%). In terms of comorbidities, the statin group had higher incidences of congestive heart failure (CHF), AKI, myocardial infarction, and COPD. Notably, the prevalence of severe liver disease was lower in the statin group than in the nonstatin (0.9% vs. 5.9%), underscoring hepatotoxicity as a principal adverse effect of statins (see Table 1 ).

Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is characterized by an unexpected, natural death due to cardiac causes, typically occurring within one hour of the onset of symptoms [ 1 ]. SCD represents a significant public health concern due to its sudden onset and often unpredictable occurrence, impacting individuals across a wide range of ages and health conditions. The incidence of SCD varies significantly based on factors such as patient demographics, comorbidities, quality of surgical and postoperative care, and duration of follow-up.
While coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery is effective in reducing the risk of myocardial infarction and subsequent cardiac events by improving myocardial perfusion, the risk of SCD remains notable, with reported rates ranging from less than 1% to over 5% per year [ 2 – 5 ]. This persistent risk is likely due to factors such as incomplete or failed revascularization, progression of native vessel disease, and the presence of myocardial scars, whic"

This persistent risk is likely due to factors such as incomplete or failed revascularization, progression of native vessel disease, and the presence of myocardial scars, which can create a substrate for arrhythmogenic activity. A study analyzing a large database of patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or CABG identified several independent predictors of SCD in patients with chronic heart disease. These predictors included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤  30%, chronic total occlusion of a coronary artery, diabetes requiring insulin therapy, chronic renal disease, and peripheral artery disease [ 5 ]. Thus, managing cardiovascular (CV) risk factors has remained the focus of preventive strategy for improving clinical outcomes after CABG.

The CABG Patch Trial further underscored the complexity of SCD prevention by demonstrating that while implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy reduced arrhythmic deaths by 45%, it did not significantly affect non-arrhythmic deaths, resulting in no significant reduction in total mortality, as 71% of the deaths were non-arrhythmic [ 6 ]. A nationwide database from Sweden reported that 58% of all deaths following CABG were cardiac in origin, with heart failure being the most common cause (65% within 30 days post-CABG and 36% beyond 30 days), followed by myocardial infarction (56% and 29%, respectively) [ 7 ]. These two studies suggest failure of revascularization may be a bigger factor in this patient population leading to adverse clinical outcomes than arrhythmogenic substrate from scarring.

Evidence has shown that CABG can reduce the incidence of SCD more effectively than PCI, with improved revascularization status and by preventing myocardial ischemia [ 8 ]. While patients with persistent low ejection fraction despite optimal GDMT are recommended to have ICD implant [ 9 ]; it is not recommended for patients undergoing CABG as a prophylaxis.
Complete surgical revascularization through CABG and optimal management of CV risk factors may be the most effective strategy for preventing fatal cardiac events leading to SCD. Therefore, it is vital to optimize medical therapy including antiplatelet therapy to sustain revascularization status after CABG. In recent years more evidence has emerged supporting dual antiplatelet therapy’s (DAPT) clinical benefits in CABG patients [ 10 – 12 ].

DAPT’s role in preventing acute graft occlusion, improving graft patency, and thereby maintaining revascularization and reducing the risk of fatal cardiac events could be of vital importance. Although most studies have not specifically evaluated the impact of DAPT on SCD and compared it with aspirin monotherapy, Kulik et al. demonstrated a reduced incidence of SCD in patients treated with ticagrelor compared to those receiving clopidogrel [ 12 ]. Recent literature suggests that DAPT could be an important and underexplored strategy in preventive medicine especially after surgical revascularization as compared to PCI.
In this study, we hypothesize that DAPT could potentially decrease the incidence of ischemic events and fatal myocardial infarction by enhancing graft survival thus lowering the risk of SCD after CABG. We sought to investigate the role of different antiplatelet therapies and cli"

The CABG Patch Trial further underscored the complexity of SCD prevention by demonstrating that while implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy reduced arrhythmic deaths by 45%, it did not significantly affect non-arrhythmic deaths, resulting in no significant reduction in total mortality, as 71% of the deaths were non-arrhythmic [ 6 ]. A nationwide database from Sweden reported that 58% of all deaths following CABG were cardiac in origin, with heart failure being the most common cause (65% within 30 days post-CABG and 36% beyond 30 days), followed by myocardial infarction (56% and 29%, respectively) [ 7 ].

These two studies suggest failure of revascularization may be a bigger factor in this patient population leading to adverse clinical outcomes than arrhythmogenic substrate from scarring. Evidence has shown that CABG can reduce the incidence of SCD more effectively than PCI, with improved revascularization status and by preventing myocardial ischemia [ 8 ]. While patients with persistent low ejection fraction despite optimal GDMT are recommended to have ICD implant [ 9 ]; it is not recommended for patients undergoing CABG as a prophylaxis.

Therefore, it is vital to optimize medical therapy including antiplatelet therapy to sustain revascularization status after CABG. In recent years more evidence has emerged supporting dual antiplatelet therapy’s (DAPT) clinical benefits in CABG patients [ 10 – 12 ]. DAPT’s role in preventing acute graft occlusion, improving graft patency, and thereby maintaining revascularization and reducing the risk of fatal cardiac events could be of vital importance. Although most studies have not specifically evaluated the impact of DAPT on SCD and compared it with aspirin monotherapy, Kulik et al. demonstrated a reduced incidence of SCD in patients treated with ticagrelor compared to those receiving clopidogrel [ 12 ].

Hypothesis
In this study, we hypothesize that DAPT could potentially decrease the incidence of ischemic events and fatal myocardial infarction by enhancing graft survival thus lowering the risk of SCD after CABG. We sought to investigate the role of different antiplatelet therapies and clinical factors in preventing risk of SCD after CABG.

This study analyzed outcomes in 2,476 patients who underwent CABG and were subsequently treated with either AMT or DAPT ( Fig 3 ). The findings provide significant insights into the role of DAPT in preventing SCD and other adverse events post-CABG. The data reveals distinct differences in patient characteristics between those on AMT and DAPT. Patients receiving AMT were healthier but had a higher proportion of patients reporting stable angina. Conversely, the DAPT group exhibited a higher prevalence of peripheral artery disease, reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR < 60), prior PCI, pre-CABG use of DAPT, and a higher likelihood of undergoing on-pump surgery with a longer operative duration (see Table 1 ). These differences might indicate a more aggressive management approach in patients with more complex coronary disease or those at higher risk of thrombotic events.

After adjusting for these baseline differences, the study found a significantly lower incidence of SCD in patients receiving DAPT compared to those on AMT (0.8% vs. 3.1%). This finding is critical, as it suggests that DAPT may offer substantial protective effects against SCD in the post-CABG setting. The adjusted odds ratio (OR = 3.831) indicates that patients on AMT were nearly four times more likely to experience SCD than those on DAPT, highlighting the potential benefit of DAPT beyond its established role (see Table 2 ). While several randomized trials and metanalyses have demonstrated significant survival benefits with the use of DAPT in patients undergoing CABG after ACS [ 10 – 14 ].

While obesity and depressed ejection fraction has been reported as predictors of SCD previously, this study presents some interesting insights relevant to this topic.

These findings of our study underscore the strong association between higher BMI and increased risk of SCD in post-CABG patients.

Although there has been extensive research regarding the contribution of smoking to the pathogenesis of CAD and SCD the contribution of obesity is less understood. Blood volume and cardiac output increase with BMI, and obesity is known to affect diastolic function and to be associated with left ventricular hypertrophy (particularly when BMI is > 30 kg/m 2 ) and a prolonged QT-interval.

Our study also contrasts with the obesity paradox theory [ 18 ], which suggests better survival in obese patients with acute cardiovascular decompensation.
Ejection fraction:
As previously reported, we observed a significant protective role of higher ejection fraction in reducing the risk of SCD following CABG. Specifically, each unit increase in EF was associated with a 3.8% reduction in SCD risk (HR =  0.962, 95% CI: 0.939–0.986, p =  0.002), suggesting that better cardiac function mitigates mortality risk in this patient population ( Fig 2 ).

While patients with persistent low ejection fraction despite optimal GDMT are recommended to have ICD implant [ 9 ]; it is not recommended for patients undergoing CABG as a prophylaxis. Perhaps more research and evidence are needed to address these important questions.
Chronic kidney disease:
Higher renal function, as indicated by a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) above 60 ml/min, is associated with a significantly lower risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) following CABG ( Fig 2 ).

Viewing atherosclerosis as a crystalloid disease provides novel insights into the role of cholesterol crystals (CCs) in the development and subsequent rupture of atherosclerotic plaques, and their role in secondary ischemic and inflammatory tissue injury [ 1 ]. The realization that free cholesterol expands as it undergoes a phase change from a liquid to a solid crystalline state helps explain how the process of crystallization may lead to plaque rupture [ [2] , [3] , [4] , [5] ] related to the rapid increase in pressure and volume within the plaque that occurs during crystallization. These changes stretch and thin the plaque cap and leave it more vulnerable to disruption from direct trauma by sharp tips of CCs that can directly puncture the fibrous cap of the plaque [ 2 , 4 ] ( Fig. 1 ).

Specifically, crystals contacting the arterial walls have been shown to scrape the intimal surface, damaging the endothelial lining and causing a loss of the normal dilatory response to acetylcholine, thus leading to vasoconstriction [ 8 ] ( Fig. 2 ). As CCs aggregate in the microcirculation they further impair perfusion of the tissues causing regional ischemia. Moreover, CCs embedded in the tissues can trigger an inflammatory response associated with macrophage infiltration, which causes inflammatory tissue damage [ 9 ]. When these events occur during coronary intervention it is referred to as the “no reflow phenomenon” related to microvascular obstruction by platelet thrombi and CCs emboli [ 8 , 10 ].

Plaque growth at the cellular level
Plaque growth is enhanced by CCs that first appear as fatty streaks in the arterial walls in early childhood [ 13 ]. CCs are believed to enhance early plaque growth by causing endothelial dysfunction that leads to the expression of cellular adhesion molecules (i.e. ICAM-1; VACAM-1; E -selectin) that enhance the entry of LDL-c and circulating leukocytes into the subintimal space [ 14 ]. CCs also form within the lipid bilayer of the endothelial cells which occurs when the density of free cholesterol in the cell membrane is enriched [ 15 , 16 ]. These CCs are then ejected into the sub-intimal space where they are mostly cleared by macrophages and degraded within liposomes. However, as the free cholesterol content within liposomes increases, new CCs may begin to develop, and as they outgrow their intracellular environment they are released into the subintimal space.

Further crystal growth leads to damage of liposomes with the release of lytic enzymes from the liposomes into the subintimal space leading to further tissue injury that eventually evolves into a free lipid pool [ 17 ] ( Fig. 4 ). Notably, contact of CCs with macrophages leads to signaling that attracts more macrophages by inducing monocyte chemotactic protein or chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) formerly MCP-1 [ 18 ]. This response is independent of CCs internalization into the macrophages. Moreover, incubation of CCs with macrophages triggers TNF-α which is known to reduce the expression of ABCA1 and reduce HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux, thus lending to accumulation of free cholesterol which is the substrate for CCs formation in the arterial wall [ 19 ].

The vulnerable atheromatous plaque
The morphologic features of plaque rupture were first described by Paris Constantinides in the 1960's who noted fissuring of the fibrous cap at the site of thrombus formation in patients who died of acute myocardial infarction [ 20 ]. Subsequent work by Davies et al. demonstrated that plaque ruptures occurred mainly at plaque edges where the fibrous cap ‘inserts' into the arterial wall [ 21 ]. Richardson et al. also demonstrated that the sites of rupture had extensive macrophage infiltration [ 22 ]. Furt"

Richardson et al. also demonstrated that the sites of rupture had extensive macrophage infiltration [ 22 ]. Further work by Henny et al. demonstrated that those sites were rich in collagenases that could break down the collagenous tissue support and then Gallis and Libby demonstrated that the inflammatory cells' release of metalloproteinases could weaken the plaque structure [ 23 , 24 ]. Although inflammation is critical to plaque instability these findings did not explain the initial trigger for the inflammatory flare and did not consider that plaque rupture could also occur independent of inflammation as a result of CC formation and expansion.

Since ethanol is a strong solvent of CCs their causal role in the development and rupture of atherosclerotic plaques was simply not considered. Ruptured plaque histology as seen by light microscopy in specimens obtained after fatal myocardial infarction also failed to provide clarity as to the events that led to plaque rupture, because the tissue processing for light microscopy used high concentrations of ethanol (up to 100 %) to dehydrate the tissues so they can be cut into thin sections and mounted on slides. This process readily dissolves CCs leaving behind ‘clefts’ that are empty spaces with the shape of crystals where CCs were previously present and now dissolved by the ethanol [ 26 ]. As a result, there was no appreciation of the way CCs could directly damage tissues. Thus, although the definition of the vulnerable plaque as one that progresses to rupture based on fea"

Thus, although the definition of the vulnerable plaque as one that progresses to rupture based on features described on light microscopy including a large lipid pool, a thin fibrous cap, loss of smooth muscle cell support and infiltration with inflammatory cells, it failed to describe the presence and potential role of CCs in plaque rupture [ 27 ].
Because multiple plaque ruptures have been found to occur concurrently in non-culprit arteries following an acute atherosclerotic event [ 28 , 29 ] it is now understood that clinical emphasis should look beyond the ‘vulnerable plaque’ and focus more on the ‘vulnerable patient’ [ 30 ].

The needle shapes are composed of pure cholesterol while rhomboidal shapes are cholesterol monohydrate which is the most common form of crystal noted in human plaques [ 32 ]. By SEM, CCs can be seen piercing and arising from the intimal surface of the arterial wall typically at sites of plaque rupture not only at the site of the tear but also on the surface of the plaque adjacent to the fibrous cap rupture.

Plaque inflammation
Given the appearance of CCs perforating the fibrous caps of atheromatous plaques observed by SEM and confocal microcopy, Abela proposed that CCs could also cause an inflammatory response akin to that triggered by other crystalloid conditions namely uric acid crystals in gout [ 34 , 35 ]. In collaboration with Latz from Bonn, Germany they proceeded to demonstrate the same inflammatory process as had been described for uric acid crystals by Martinon et al. [ 36 ]. Essentially, the inflammation occurs by activating NLRP3 inflammasomes that then activate interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and subsequently IL-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP) [ [37] , [38] , [39] ]. This provided strong evidence that CCs are recognized as foreign bodies by the innate immune system and thus able to trigger an inflammatory response. Other inflammation cytokines were found to be"

Other inflammation cytokines were found to be activated by CCs including complesomes and complement. These inflammatory activities lead to plaque destabilization by releasing metalloproteinases from the macrophages that cause local tissue breakdown leading to growth of the plaque core and arterial wall positive remodeling thus enhancing the risk for plaque rupture and/or erosion.
Plaque rupture and distal cholesterol crystal embolization
Appreciation that atherosclerotic plaques become structurally unstable due to CC induced inflammation and CC induced trauma leads to the understanding that CC formation is critical in the development of a vulnerable plaque [ 31 ].

Although cholesterol in the plaque core is typically present in a liquid and semi-liquid state [ 32 ], local physicochemical conditions can trigger crystallization [ 5 ]. Thus, the greater the amount of liquid and free cholesterol, the greater the risk of CC formation, and the greater the risk of plaque rupture [ 2 ].
Local conditions within the plaque that can trigger cholesterol crystallization include increased amounts of free cholesterol, a basic pH, hydration of the cholesterol molecule to the monohydrated form and a drop in ambient temperature [ 5 ]. These physicochemical conditions may explain the increased risk of cardiovascular events during fall and winter [ 40 ] as well as the circadian early morning clustering of cardiovascular events that occur when the body core temperature may be lowered by several degrees centigrade [ 5 ].

Another clinical aspect that may be explained by the role of CCs in plaque rupture relates to the atypical symptoms in women who present with acute myocardial infarction [ 41 , 42 ]. Men have been shown to have larger lipid pools in their plaques compared to women, even for the same degree of arterial stenosis by angiography [ 43 ]. This may be related to the longer time men have to accumulate cholesterol within plaques while women are protected by estrogens but then catch up later in life with men [ 44 ]. Also, estrogens have been shown to dissolve CCs being of a very similar molecular structure to cholesterol [ 45 ]. The reduced amount of cholesterol in the plaque core may still crystallize but the amount of free cholesterol is not large enough to cause plaque rupture but enough to perforate the fibrous cap to cause plaque erosion that can lead to thrombosis but in a slower and more protracted manner compa"

Furthermore, CC cluster sizes are significantly smaller for women than men [ 46 ]. Hence the myocardial infarction may be less recognized clinically which could explain the higher mortality in women due to being missed [ 41 ] ( Fig. 6 ).

Recently Komatsu et al. using non-obstructive angioscopy (NOGA) demonstrated presence of CCs emerging from plaques in human aortas [ 12 ]. Shimmering crystals were seen to be floating out of atheromatous plaques by the gentle nudging of plaque with the angioscope during examination. Many CCs emanating from spontaneously ruptured plaques were captured by this process further confirming their presence in live patients. Other in vivo work with optical coherence tomography (OCT) by Tian et al. demonstrated the presence of CCs aggregates in both stable non-culprit and ruptured plaques. They proposed that the presence of CCs may provide an important independent prognostic signal of future risk of plaque instability by demonstrating that non-culprit plaques with CCs were more likely to have higher risk features including a larger lipid burden, more macrophages, and spotty calcification [ 47 , 48 ].

Local physicochemical effects
Local conditions within the plaque that can trigger cholesterol crystallization include increased amounts of free cholesterol, a basic pH, hydration of the cholesterol molecule to the monohydrated form and a drop in ambient temperature [ 5 ]. These physicochemical conditions may explain the increased risk of cardiovascular events during fall and winter [ 40 ] as well as the circadian early morning clustering of cardiovascular events that occur when the body core temperature may be lowered by several degrees centigrade [ 5 ].

Men have been shown to have larger lipid pools in their plaques compared to women, even for the same degree of arterial stenosis by angiography [ 43 ]. This may be related to the longer time men have to accumulate cholesterol within plaques while women are protected by estrogens but then catch up later in life with men [ 44 ]. Also, estrogens have been shown to dissolve CCs being of a very similar molecular structure to cholesterol [ 45 ]. The reduced amount of cholesterol in the plaque core may still crystallize but the amount of free cholesterol is not large enough to cause plaque rupture but enough to perforate the fibrous cap to cause plaque erosion that can lead to thrombosis but in a slower and more protracted manner compared to men and explain the more ‘subtle stuttering’ symptoms in women with myocardial infarc"

Furthermore, CC cluster sizes are significantly smaller for women than men [ 46 ]. Hence the myocardial infarction may be less recognized clinically which could explain the higher mortality in women due to being missed [ 41 ] ( Fig. 6 ).

Even though the obstruction may not be sufficient to cause ischemic injury due to the extensive capillary bed, the presence of the CCs can lead to inflammation that can further damage the myocardium. Evidence for this process of injury was provided in an experimental model where release of CCs into the femoral artery of a rabbit model resulted in local inflammation detected by positron emission tomography (PET) scanning. These areas were biopsied and found to have marked macrophage infiltration with CCs that were embedded in the macrophage cytoplasm [ 9 ] ( Fig. 9 ).

Therapy that affects CC growth and morphology
Several medications that are used to prevent and treat cardiovascular events were investigated for their potential for dissolving CCs. Agents that lower cholesterol and reduce inflammation seemed to be primary candidates and include statins, aspirin and colchicine.

Thus, it is conceivable that one of the mechanisms whereby statins reduce the risk of cardiovascular events relates to their ability to reduce crystal growth and expansion. Moreover, the effect of statins was found to be dose-related with higher doses having a significantly a greater reduction of the volume expansion [ 50 ] ( Fig. 10 ). Three different statins were tested and were found to have similar effects with atorvastatin being the most effective followed by simvastatin and pravastatin. A similar effect was noted in a study of human carotid plaques removed at endarterectomy where patients taking statins had evidence of dissolving CCs while those not taking stains prior to surgery had intact CCs [ 50 ].

Summary
Understanding how cholesterol in atherosclerotic plaques contributes to an acute cardiovascular event is critical to elucidating how to best treat patients with atherosclerotic disease. Although inflammation is a critical aspect of atherosclerosis, it is never-the-less a common response to an injury, which in the case of atherosclerotic plaque relates to the physical conversion of cholesterol into its crystalline phase. This process like many other crystalloid disease conditions such as gall stones, renal stones, uric acid crystals is known to trigger an inflammatory response. The presented data provides evidence that cardiovascular events fall into the same category of a crystalloid-induced condition with the atherosclerotic pl"

The presented data provides evidence that cardiovascular events fall into the same category of a crystalloid-induced condition with the atherosclerotic plaque of an artery. CCs that embolize from ruptured plaques not only obstruct arterioles and capillaries leading to ischemia but also trigger inflammation that further adds to myocaradial injury. Hence, dissolving the CCs is potentially a major therapeutic step that may prove beneficial in the prevention and regulation of the cause of injury that leads to inflammation and direct tissue injury.

Coronary bifurcation lesions remain a challenging subset in interventional cardiology due to their complex anatomy and the risk of restenosis, particularly at the side-branch ostium. While provisional stenting of the main branch, with side-branch intervention only when necessary, has emerged as the preferred approach for most bifurcation lesions, the optimal technique for side-branch treatment remains uncertain [ 1 , 2 ]. Side-branch restenosis can lead to recurrent angina, ischemia, and the need for repeat revascularization, increasing procedural risks and healthcare burden.
Drug-eluting stents (DES) have reduced restenosis rates in the main branch compared to bare-metal stents; however, side-branch ostial restenosis remains a major concern.

The crush technique carries a higher risk of stent malapposition, culotte stenting requires multiple rewiring steps, making it more complex, and T-stenting can result in incomplete ostial coverage, increasing the likelihood of restenosis. Studies comparing complex two-stent techniques with provisional stenting have generally shown similar or superior outcomes with the simpler provisional approach, particularly in terms of major adverse cardiac events (MACE), procedural time, and reduced risk of peri-procedural complications [ 4 - 6 ].
Recent research has focused on optimizing the provisional approach through adjunctive techniques, such as proximal optimization (POT) and kissing balloon inflation, which enhances stent apposition and side-branch patency [ 7 ].

Additionally, there is growing interest in drug-eluting balloons (DEBs) as an alternative to side-branch stenting in bifurcation lesions. This strategy delivers antiproliferative agents without placing a permanent scaffold, potentially reducing restenosis and preserving future intervention options [ 8 ]. Early studies have shown promising results with DCB use in small vessels and in-stent restenosis; however, data on de novo bifurcation lesions are limited [ 9 , 10 ].
Ongoing trials are evaluating the current evidence comparing DCBs with provisional stenting strategies for bifurcation lesions based on short-term angiographic and clinical outcomes.

DEBs versus stenting for provisional bifurcation lesions require a comprehensive understanding of historical developments, key concepts, and clinical challenges [ 11 ].
This study aimed to assess the short-term outcomes of these approaches and to explore their potential implications for future practice. In this prospective cohort study, patients with bifurcation lesions treated with DEBs and provisional stenting were evaluated based on the incidence of MACE, including restenosis, target lesion revascularization (TLR), myocardial infarction (MI), stent thrombosis, and death.

However, short-term follow-up assessments were conducted at one and three months post-intervention to capture the early incidence of MACE. While the study duration was one year, the primary focus was on short-term outcomes. After the intervention, all patients were put on dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) comprising aspirin, clopidogrel, and high-intensity statins. Furthermore, other medications were prescribed depending on the needs of the patient. Follow-up assessments were conducted at one and three months post-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to capture the peak incidence of MACE and assess treatment adherence.
To ensure a comprehensive follow-up, patients were contacted through in-person visits, telephone communication, and electronic message reminders, with remote consultations offered to those experiencing transportation limitations.

Study population and sample size
Fifty participants were divided into 2 equal cohorts: 25 were treated with DEBs and 25 were treated with stents. Using OpenRCT, the sample size was calculated with a 95% confidence level, 80% statistical power, and an anticipated outcome difference of 20% between cohorts.
Inclusion criteria
The study included patients who met the specific inclusion criteria. Participants were required to be at least 18 years old and have a confirmed diagnosis of stable angina or acute coronary syndrome (ACS) necessitating PCI. Moreover, patients were required to present with non-left main distal bifurcation lesions involving the main vessel and one or more side branches, excluding those classified as complex bifurcation lesions based on “Definition Criteria”. Additionally, the lesion"

Additionally, the lesions were required to be amenable to DEB treatment, wherein side-branch stenting could be avoided or deemed unnecessary.
Exclusion criteria
Patients with specific conditions were excluded from this study. This study included individuals with non-bifurcation or complex bifurcation lesions that necessitated stenting. Patients with severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) were excluded due to the increased risk of contrast-induced nephropathy and poorer post-PCI outcomes, which could confound the evaluation of MACE rates. Furthermore, patients with severe comorbidities, pregnant women, or those with contraindications to antiplatelet therapy were deemed ineligible for participation.

Treatment protocols
In the stenting group, provisional stenting was performed in the main vessel while the side branch remained untreated via percutaneous coronary angioplasty (POBA). To optimize bifurcation, kissing balloon inflation was performed as needed. The decision to perform kissing balloon inflation was made at the operator’s discretion based on anatomical indications.
In the DEB group, neither side branch POBA nor kissing balloon inflation was performed. DEBs were used to deliver antiproliferative agents to the vessel wall to reduce restenosis without the placement of a permanent scaffold.

In addition to the primary outcomes, this study evaluated several secondary outcomes, including procedural complications such as coronary dissection, no-reflow phenomenon, vascular access complications, and periprocedural myocardial infarction. Short-term adverse events, particularly bleeding incidents, were also assessed.

Future studies with extended follow-up are warranted to assess long-term efficacy. Bleeding incidents were classified according to the Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) criteria (grades 2, 3, and 5). Events were adjudicated based on hospital records, clinical examination findings during follow-up visits, and standardized patient-reported outcomes obtained via telephone or electronic consultations.

Results
In this prospective cohort study, 50 (100%) patients with bifurcation lesions were enrolled and equally assigned to two groups: 25 (50%) treated with DEBs and 25 (50%) treated with provisional stenting. Short-term clinical outcomes were assessed based on the incidence of MACE, including restenosis, TLR, MI, stent thrombosis, and mortality while accounting for various demographic baselines (Table 1 ).

This table presents the baseline demographics of the two study groups: the DEB group (n = 25) and the stenting group (n = 25). The absence of statistically significant differences between the two groups across all demographic parameters (p > 0.05) suggests that the groups were comparable in terms of baseline characteristics. This comparability ensures an unbiased assessment of outcomes between the two intervention strategies.

Discussion
The findings of this study provide significant insights into the short-term outcomes of DEBs versus stenting for provisional bifurcation lesions.

Beyond preventing restenosis, DAPT plays a crucial role in stabilizing vulnerable plaques and reducing thrombotic events while high-intensity statins contribute to plaque stabilization and exert anti-inflammatory effects. These pharmacological benefits likely contributed to the low rates of MACE observed in both groups, reinforcing their comparable safety profiles. These results align with previous research emphasizing the critical role of pharmacological management in PCI. Although the overall incidence of MACE was marginally lower in the DEB group (two (8%) vs. three (12%)), this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.58). These findings are consistent with existing literature, suggesting that DEBs and stents demonstrate comparable short-term efficacy for certain bifurcation lesions [ 14 ].

The observed restenosis and TLR rates were slightly higher in the stenting group, suggesting a potential advantage of DEBs in minimizing restenosis due to the absence of a permanent scaffold. Without a metal scaffold, DEBs reduce the risk of neointimal hyperplasia, particularly benefiting patients with small vessel diameters or those at high risk for restenosis such as individuals with diabetes or diffuse coronary disease. However, the limited sample size and lack of statistical significance (p > 0.05) necessitate a cautious interpretation of these findings. In larger studies, these numerical differences may reach statistical significance, underscoring the need for further research to validate these preliminary observations.

The comparable incidence of myocardial infarction (1 (4%)) in both groups and the absence of stent thrombosis or mortality indicate the overall short-term safety of both strategies. The absence of stent thrombosis and mortality may reflect the small sample size and short follow-up period, which limit the ability to detect rare or late-onset events. Extended follow-up is necessary to capture these outcomes, as complications like late stent thrombosis often occur beyond the initial months post-intervention. However, the increased procedural complexity associated with stenting, particularly regarding side branch management, underscores the potential technical advantages of DEBs in select cases.
The low incidence of major adverse events, including major bleeding, in both groups suggests that both DEB and stenting are safe treatment options for patients with bifurcation lesions. Similarly, the comparable rates of minor bleeding and dys"
PMC11882106,PMC11882106_chunk_18,"including major bleeding, in both groups suggests that both DEB and stenting are safe treatment options for patients with bifurcation lesions. Similarly, the comparable rates of minor bleeding and dyspnea reinforce the equivalent safety profiles of the two interventions. No statistically significant differences were observed between the DEB and stenting groups for any adverse event category (p > 0.05).
Despite these findings, the study's limited sample size and relatively short follow-up period constrain its ability to detect rare events and assess long-term outcomes, such as late restenosis or chronic adverse events. Further studies with larger cohorts and extended follow-up durations are necessary to confirm these results.

Studies have demonstrated that conservative provisional side-branch intervention strategies yield similar or superior long-term clinical outcomes compared to more aggressive approaches [ 2 , 16 ]. The conservative strategy has been associated with lower rates of procedure-related myocardial necrosis and target vessel failure at three years of follow-up [ 16 ]. However, some studies have reported contradictory findings. For instance, Chen et al. (2017) reported that the double-kissing crush stenting technique was associated with lower TLR rates compared to provisional stenting at five years of follow-up, particularly in complex bifurcation lesions [ 11 ]. In contrast, Ferenc et al. (2008) found no significant difference in restenosis rates between routine and provisional T-stenting approaches.

While DES are commonly used in bifurcation interventions, the provided literature contains limited data on drug-eluting balloons in this context [ 5 ]. Burzotta et al. (2011) compared different types of DES (sirolimus-eluting vs. everolimus-eluting) in bifurcation lesions and found similar procedural performance but improved side-branch outcomes with everolimus-eluting stents. In summary, while provisional stenting has demonstrated favorable outcomes in bifurcation lesions, there remains a lack of direct comparisons with drug-eluting balloons in the existing literature [ 17 ].

Study limitations and future directions
A key limitation of this study is its relatively small sample size (50 patients), which may impact the generalizability of the findings. While the results suggest comparable short-term efficacy and safety between DEBs and stenting, larger multicenter studies are required to validate these outcomes in broader patient populations.
Conclusions
Our findings suggest that drug-eluting balloons (DEBs) demonstrated comparable short-term efficacy and safety to provisional stenting in bifurcation lesions. However, due to the limited sample size and short follow-up period, definitive conclusions regarding non-inferiority cannot be made.

The DEB group showed a similar safety profile and efficacy compared to the stenting group, with a non-significant trend toward lower rates of restenosis and target lesion revascularization (TLR).
These findings indicate that DEBs may be a viable treatment option for selected bifurcation lesions, offering the potential benefit of reduced procedural complexity by avoiding permanent scaffold placement and minimizing the need for side-branch interventions. While this study suggests that both DEBs and stenting are effective therapeutic modalities for managing provisional bifurcation lesions, the simplified procedural approach associated with DEBs may make them preferable in certain patient subsets. However, to validate these preliminary findings and assess long-term outcomes, including late restenosis and stent thrombosis, larger multicenter studies with extended follow-up are warranted.

PMC11905749,PMC11905749_chunk_1,"Introduction
Several randomized clinical trials have suggested that the strategy of short duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) up to 1–3 months followed by P2Y 12 inhibitor monotherapy reduced major bleeding events without increasing cardiovascular events after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). 1–5 However, the procedural complexity of PCI has been acknowledged as a determinant for cardiovascular events, and short DAPT compared with prolonged DAPT has been reported to increase the risk of cardiovascular events after complex PCI. 6 On the other hand, another study showed that P2Y 12 inhibitor monotherapy after very short DAPT compared with standard DAPT did not increase cardiovascular events regardless of complex PCI. 7 , 8 As of now, there are no data regarding the optimal antiplatelet monotherapy after very short DAPT in patients who underwent complex PCI.

Recently, 1-year results of the STOPDAPT-3 (ShorT and OPtimal Duration of Dual AntiPlatelet Therapy-3) trial reported that aspirin monotherapy compared with clopidogrel monotherapy was associated with comparable cardiovascular and bleeding outcomes beyond 1 month and up to 1 year after PCI. 9 , 10 In the present study, we conducted a pre-specified subgroup analysis stratified by complex and non-complex PCI using the 1-year follow-up data from the STOPDAPT-3 trial.

We also conducted the overall 1-year analysis evaluating throughout 1 year. The overall 1-year analysis set consisted of 5962 patients after excluding 3 patients who did not receive PCI for the absence of suitable coronary lesions, and 37 patients who withdrew consent ( Figure 1 ).

In the present study, we analysed the treatment-by-subgroup interactions in the effects of the aspirin group compared with the clopidogrel group in complex PCI and non-complex PCI subgroups. All reported P values were two-sided. P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. All analysis was performed with R version 4.2.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).
Results
Among 5833 patients in the 30-day landmark analysis, there were 1415 patients (24.3%) who underwent complex PCI (aspirin group: N = 705, and clopidogrel group: N = 710), and 4418 patients (75.7%) who underwent non-complex PCI (aspirin group: N = 2215, and clopidogrel group: N = 2203) ( Figure 1 ).

Patients with complex PCI more often had comorbidities such as history of heart failure, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, anaemia, and chronic kidney disease than those without. The prevalence of the high bleeding risk by the criteria of the Academic Research Consortium was higher in patients with complex PCI than in those without. Procedural characteristics were largely different between patients with and without complex PCI. The rate of intracoronary imaging use was >90% regardless of complex PCI. In terms of medications, total heparin dose during the index PCI was slightly higher in patients with complex PCI than in those without. The prescription rates of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist and β-blockers were higher in patients with complex PCI than in those without.

The main findings in the present study were as follows: (i) The effect of aspirin monotherapy relative to clopidogrel monotherapy beyond 1 month and up to 1 year was not significant for cardiovascular events regardless of complex PCI, but there was a significant interaction between complex PCI and the effect of aspirin monotherapy relative to clopidogrel monotherapy for cardiovascular events due to numerically lower risk o"

(ii) The effect of aspirin monotherapy relative to clopidogrel monotherapy beyond 1 month and up to 1 year was not significant for bleeding events regardless of complex PCI without significant interaction.
The European Society of Cardiology and the Japanese Circulation Society guidelines have suggested that complex PCI is a risk factor of stent-driven recurrent ischaemic events. 11 , 12 Indeed, patients with complex PCI had higher incidence of cardiovascular events compared with those without in the overall 1-year analysis in the present study.

Giustino et al. 6 reported that prolonged DAPT (12–24 months) compared with short DAPT (3–6 months) reduced major adverse cardiac events and coronary thrombotic events after complex PCI in the individual patient data-level meta-analysis of six randomized clinical trials in which aspirin monotherapy was mainly used after stopping short DAPT. More recently, Gragnano et al. 7 showed that P2Y 12 inhibitor (ticagrelor, prasugrel, or clopidogrel) monotherapy after very short DAPT (1–3 months) compared with standard DAPT was not associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events after complex PCI in the individual patient data-level meta-analysis of five randomized clinical trials. In addition, the subgroup analysis of the STOPDAPT-2 Total Cohort (ShorT and OPtimal Duration of Dual AntiPlatelet Therapy-2 Total Cohort) showed that clopidogrel monotherapy after 1-month DAPT compared with standard DAPT was not associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events regardless of co"

Indeed, the HOST-EXAM (HOST-EXtended Antiplatelet Monotherapy) trial demonstrated that clopidogrel monotherapy reduced cardiovascular events compared with aspirin monotherapy in patients with chronic phase after PCI. 16 The 5-year follow-up of the STOPDAPT-2 trial also showed that clopidogrel monotherapy was associated with numerically lower risk of cardiovascular events compared with aspirin monotherapy beyond 1 year after PCI. 17 Moreover, in an individual patient data-level meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials comparing P2Y 12 inhibitor monotherapy with aspirin monotherapy in patients with coro"

In the present study, the incidence of cardiovascular events beyond 1 month and up to 1 year was not different between aspirin monotherapy and clopidogrel monotherapy regardless of complex PCI.

Introduction
Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute systemic vasculitis of unknown cause that mainly occurs in childhood and was first reported in Japan by Tomisaku Kawasaki in 1967 ( 1 ).

It is a syndrome caused by inflammation mainly in the medium-sized arteries with characteristic clinical symptoms, including fever, rash, eye redness, lip and tongue redness, swelling of the hands and feet, and cervical lymphadenitis ( 2 , 3 ). Treatment consists of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and oral aspirin, which has an 80% efficacy rate. However, a serious complication of KD is coronary artery aneurysm (CAA), which occurs in 7–8% of patients and persists for more than 1 month after onset in 2–3% of cases ( 3 , 4 ). Patients with giant coronary artery aneurysms (GAs; i.e., aneurysms ≥8 mm in diameter or coronary artery Z-score ≥10) are at high risk of cardiovascular events (CEs), particularly myocardial infarction and heart failure, and require lifelong treatment ( 5 ).
In Japan, where KD was first recognized and treated, at least 272,000 people were estimated to have KD by the end of 2010, 117,000 of whom had reached adulthood ( 6"

In Japan, where KD was first recognized and treated, at least 272,000 people were estimated to have KD by the end of 2010, 117,000 of whom had reached adulthood ( 6 ). Nationwide surveys in Japan have investigated deaths from coronary sequelae of KD in young adults in detail ( 7 , 8 ). A questionnaire-based survey of 644 hospitals across Japan in 2010–2011 identified 67 deaths in patients who were judged to have had KD in childhood. In these patients, death occurred at a median interval of 16 years after the acute phase and the culprit lesion was characterized by aneurysm ≥6 mm in the acute KD and giant aneurysm in the long-term ( 8 ). KD patients with GA have the highest risk of CEs ( 5 , 8 - 10 ). Antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapies are used in these patients, but there is insufficient evidence to guide their dosage and duration ( 3 , 4 , 11 ).

Since 1998, we have been treating KD patients with GAs using a uniform antithrombotic protocol at our facility in Chiba Prefecture, Japan. In this retrospective study, we examined the status of GAs and their treatment and outcomes in order to evaluate our antithrombotic treatment protocol and add some evidence regarding the long-term management for KD with GA, and it is hoped that this work will provide insights for the management of adult KD patients with GA.

Methods
The medical records at Chiba University Hospital were retrospectively searched to identify patients with a diagnosis of KD and GA who were treated in the acute phase of KD between 1999 and 2013. GA was defined as a coronary artery diameter of ≥8 mm ( 3 , 11 , 12 ). Modera"

GA was defined as a coronary artery diameter of ≥8 mm ( 3 , 11 , 12 ). Moderate CAA was defined as a coronary artery diameter of ≥4 and <8 mm, and small CAA was defined as a coronary artery diameter of ≥3 and <4 mm. The maximum diameter in the acute phase was recorded by echocardiography and coronary angiography. Coronary artery Z-scores were computed using a calculator based on data for Japanese children ( 13 ). Patients who declined to participate in this research in writing and those deemed unsuitable for inclusion in the opinion of the principal investigator were excluded.
The following data were obtained from the medical records: age at onset of KD, date of treatment initiation for KD, results of laboratory tests, details of treatment, details of antithrombotic therapy, date of resolution of fever, date of CAA development, site(s) of GA, CEs, and death. CEs we"

CEs were defined as myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, and asymptomatic myocardial infarction. Asymptomatic myocardial infarction was diagnosed by electrocardiographic evidence of ischemic change at the time of routine evaluation in the outpatient department. Seven patients had CEs (event group) and 9 did not (non-event group).
Our antithrombotic protocol for patients with KD and CAA is as follows. We consider pyrexia to have resolved when the patient’s temperature remained below 37.5 ℃ for 48 h. We then reduce the aspirin dose from 30–50 to 3–5 mg/kg/day. Continuous intravenous heparin is started when the diameter of a CAA is ≥6 mm and then switched to oral warfarin when laboratory tests confirm that the inflammatory response has resolved and the aneurysm has stopped dilating (phase 1).

The warfarin dose is determined by a target prothrombin time-international normalized ratio (PT-INR) of 2.0–2.5 on coagulation tests. Patients with no CEs or findings of thrombosis in the first 2–3 years of the illness (phase 2) are considered for discontinuation of warfarin and continuation on aspirin alone (phase 3).
Initial coronary angiography is performed when coronary arteritis is judged to have subsided, which is typically around 3 months after onset of KD. A second coronary angiogram is performed 1 year after onset of KD.

In the event group, 1 patient experienced fatal myocardial infarction and 3 underwent coronary artery bypass grafting. Three patients had CEs in phase 1, 2 had CEs in phase 2, and 2 had CEs in phase 3 ( Table 2 ). Four events occurred when the prothrombin time was poorly controlled. Case 7 had a myocardial infarction 3 months after discontinuation of warfarin ( Table 2 ).

Discussion
In this study, the incidence of CEs was 44% in 16 KD patients with GA on antithrombotic therapy over a median of 5.8 years. A recent systematic review of studies that have investigated the prognosis of CAA in KD reported that 10-year survival ranged from 92% to 99% and 10-year major adverse CE-free survival ranged from 66% to 91% ( 14 ). That report included all sizes of CAA. The 10-year survival rate for patients with GA was reported to be 94–99% and 10-year CE-free survival to be 58–71% at 10 years ( 9 ). In terms of the prognosis, our results are comparable with those previously reported. However, the incidence of 44% for CEs is still very high, and we believe our treatment protocol is unsatisfactory and needs to "

However, the incidence of 44% for CEs is still very high, and we believe our treatment protocol is unsatisfactory and needs to be improved. In our antithrombotic protocol, anticoagulation was discontinued after 2 or 4 years if a patient had no CEs, regardless of the morphology or number of CAAs. By evaluating this protocol, this work provides evidence that can contribute to establishing discontinuation criteria.
The first step needed to improve management of patients with GA is strict control of prothrombin time. Three of our patients who experienced CEs had a low prothrombin time of 1.0–1.5 at the time of the event. It is important to counsel patients and families about the high risk of CEs, increase patient adherence, and adjust the dosage of medication appropriately.

Dual antiplatelet therapy has been recommended for adults with coronary vascular disease ( 15 - 17 ). However, the risk of bleeding is expected to be increased, and large-scale trials are difficult to conduct in KD patients with CAA, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions.
The maximum Z-score during follow-up was significantly larger in the group with CE. A prognostic study of 209 Japanese patients with KD and GA reported a significantly greater maximum Z-score in the group with CE ( 10 ). In the present study, all patients with CEs had a maximum Z-score of ≥14 and those without CEs had a wide distribution of maximum Z-scores ranging from 9.3 to 19.7.
Our results suggest that the presence of GAs in multiple branches is associated with a high risk of CEs, which is in line with the findings of a study by Tsuda et al. ( 9 ). They reported that CEs wer"

Furthermore, potentially good collateral arteries may develop more easily in patients with unilateral GA than in those with bilateral GA ( 9 , 18 ). This finding is important in terms of treatment decision-making in both the early and late stages. Optimal treatment by coronary artery bypass grafting could be considered, especially in patients with bilateral GA.
This study has several limitations. First, the sample size was small, and the follow-up duration was relatively short.

Second, the study was conducted in 2013–2014. The treatment guidelines were revised in the US in 2017 and in Japan in 2020 ( 3 , 4 ). The latest guidelines for KD recommend continued anticoagulation for the most severe cases of CAA, including GA, which is supported by our results.
Conclusions
In this case series, the prognosis of KD with GA was unsatisfactory in patients treated using our protocol of anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy, especially in those with large and multiple GAs. We recommend continuation of strict anticoagulation therapy in addition to antiplatelet therapy in these patients.

Antiplatelet treatment is a cornerstone in the management of patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), effectively reducing the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events. Aspirin, the most common antiplatelet agent, acts by inhibiting the production of thromboxane, a molecule responsible for platelet aggregation and thrombus formation. Aspirin is widely available without a prescription, typically as 300 mg tablets, and is commonly used as an anti-inflammatory drug for minor aches, pains, and fever reduction. Low-dose aspirin (usually 75 mg) is widely used in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular prevention, helping to reduce the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and blood clots in high-risk individuals. In addition, aspirin is used in obstetric care to prevent complications such as pre-eclampsia in pregnant women at elevated risk [ 1 ].

Antiplatelet drugs are recommended for the secondary prevention of cardio- and cerebrovascular disease. However, its role in primary prevention remains controversial and challenging to define [ 2 , 3 , 4 ]. This controversy arises from the delicate balance between its modest cardiovascular benefits and the potential for serious adverse events, particularly bleeding complications. Contemporary meta-analyses have demonstrated that while aspirin use in primary prevention may yield a small reduction in cardiovascular events, the accompanying increase in bleeding risk often outweighs the benefits, resulting in an uncertain net clinical benefit [ 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 ].
For primary prevention, these drugs are advised only in patients at very high risk but are not mandatory, as the balance between risk and benefit remains unsettled. In older individuals, the age-related risk of bleeding necessitates a "

In older individuals, the age-related risk of bleeding necessitates a careful risk/benefit evaluation before prescribing antiplatelet drugs, whether for primary or secondary cardiovascular prevention [ 11 ].
In light of these findings, the guidelines from major cardiovascular societies have taken a cautious stance. The 2019 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines recommend the infrequent use of aspirin in individuals without established ASCVD, given the lack of a clear net benefit [ 12 ]. Similarly, the ESC guidelines for cardiovascular disease prevention advise against the routine use of antiplatelet therapy in individuals with low or moderate cardiovascular risk due to concerns over major bleeding, assigning a class III recommendation with level A evidence [ 2 ].

These positions underscore the need for a more nuanced, patient-centered approach to aspirin therapy in primary prevention, taking into account the individual risk factors for both cardiovascular events and bleeding.
Personalized medicine approaches, integrating tools such as risk stratification scores and biomarker profiles, may help refine the identification of patients most likely to benefit from antiplatelet therapy [ 13 ]. However, real-world data on this issue remain limited.
To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a post hoc analysis of the VITAL (VITamins and Lifestyle) cohort data, aiming to evaluate whether findings from randomized controlled trials regarding aspirin use are applicable to broader, non-trial populations.

3. Results
Out of the 25,871 individuals enrolled in the VITAL study, 25,497 participants provided data on baseline aspirin use, while 394 individuals did not report such information. Among those who reported baseline aspirin use, 13,927 individuals did not use aspirin at baseline, whereas 11,570 individuals reported using aspirin at baseline ( Figure 1 ).
The characteristics of the group of patients taking aspirin included age, sex, body mass index (BMI), race, smoking habits, and comorbidities ( Table 1 ). The aspirin users’ mean age was 67.5 years (vs. 65.9 years in non-users, p < 0.001), 54.7% we"

The aspirin users’ mean age was 67.5 years (vs. 65.9 years in non-users, p < 0.001), 54.7% were male (vs. 45.1%, p < 0.001), and the mean BMI value was higher in aspirin users with 28.4 kg/m 2 compared with a mean BMI of 27.8 kg/m 2 in non-users ( p < 0.001). The number of current smokers amongst aspirin users was lower compared with aspirin non-users (6.2% versus 8.0%, p < 0.001). At baseline, 58.5% of aspirin users had arterial hypertension treated with medication, significantly higher compared with aspirin non-users (42.1%, p < 0.001). The aspirin users with diabetes mellitus were more frequent (17.7%) than diabetic individuals not treated with aspirin (10.3%; p < 0.001). The usage of cholesterol-lowering medication and diabetes mellitus (DM) medication was also higher for patients under aspirin medication compared with patients who were not using aspirin ( Table 1 ).

Table 2 shows the events and incidence rates within 5.3 years of follow-up according to the use of aspirin at baseline.
In the unadjusted analysis, the aspirin group presented a higher risk of cardiovascular mortality (HR 1.30, 95%CI 1.03 to 1.64) and cardiovascular events, such as major cardiovascular events (HR 1.21, 95%CI 1.03 to 1.64), coronary heart disease (HR 1.39, 95%CI 1.19 to 1.65), and stroke (HR 1.31, 95%CI 1.03 to 1.65) ( Figure 2 ). However, after adjustingfor demographic and clinical variables, aspirin was not identified as a predictor of cardiovascular death (HR 1.17, 95%CI 0.89 to 1.55), major cardiovascular events (HR 1.04, 95%CI 0.89 to 1.22), coronary heart disease (HR 1.16, 95%CI 0.98 to 1.37), nor stroke (HR 1.01, 95%CI 0.77 to 1.31)— Figure 2 and Appendix A .

The adjusted HR for aspirin use in primary prevention varied by race/ethnicity ( Table 3 ). Among Caucasians, no significant differences were found for mortality (HR 0.86, 95%CI 0.74–1.04), CV mortality (HR 0.96, 95%CI 0.68–1.34), or MACE (HR 0.96, 95%CI 0.80–1.16). In Black participants, aspirin use was associated with a higher CV mortality (HR 2.01, 95%CI 1.10–3.68), while other outcomes were not significant. Results for Hispanic, Asian, and Native American groups were inconclusive due to wide confidence intervals or insufficient data. These findings suggest potential racial differences in aspirin’s effects, particularly in Black participants, warranting further investigation.

4. Discussion
The use of aspirin in primary prevention was not associated with the risk reduction of cardiovascular events, after adjustment for demographic and clinical characteristics, in this post hoc evaluation of the VITAL cohort data. It should be stressed that individuals with prescribed aspirin at baseline had an overall prevalence of clinical characteristics that predict a higher risk of cardiovascular events, such as increased age, male gender, higher BMI, and more frequent parental history of MI. These findings suggest that prescribing practices may have been influenced by clinicians’ perception of risk, aligning with the principles of individualized care.
It is also important to contextualize these findings within the timeframe of data collection, which occurred over a decade ago when the evidence against aspirin in primary prevention was less definitive. This underscores the need for contemporary analy"

This underscores the need for contemporary analyses that incorporate the advancements in personalized medicine, such as the integration of genetic and biomarker-based risk stratification, to guide more precise therapeutic decisions in primary prevention.
In 2009, a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials suggested that aspirin use could reduce by 12% the risk of vascular events, mainly non-fatal MI, and suggested that aspirin could even have benefits in reducing all-cause mortality [ 18 ]. However, it is plausible that these cardiovascular benefits reflected an era when cardiovascular risk factors were less effectively managed, leading to a higher relative benefit of antiplatelet therapy.

Over the past two decades, accumulating evidence has challenged the role of aspirin in primary prevention. Despite this growing evidence, a 2017 National Health Interview Survey revealed that 23.4% of individuals reported using aspirin for primary prevention, with 23% of these doing so without a physician’s recommendation [ 19 ]. So, these findings highlight not only the need for continued physician education but also the importance of managing patient expectations and beliefs about the benefits and risks of aspirin. Incorporating personalized medicine approaches, such as individualized risk stratification and shared decision-making, could help bridge the gap between clinical evidence and patient behavior, optimizing the use of aspirin in primary prevention.

The main evidence against aspirin use in primary prevention came to light in 2018 with three important trials—the ASPREE trial (older adults) [ 20 ], ASCEND trial (patients with diabetes) [ 21 ], and ARRIVE study (average-risk adults) [ 22 ]. Subsequently, systematic reviews have reached the same conclusions as our post hoc analysis in the general population, but also in specific groups of higher cardiovascular risk, such as those with diabetes or chronic kidney disease [ 6 , 7 , 8 , 23 ]. On the other hand, years after this change in paradigm, few studies still point in a different direction. For instance, Zhao et al. stated that low-dose aspirin should be considered for primary prevention in aboriginal people with high cardiovascular risk, due to reducing all-cause mortality (HR 0.45, 95%CI 0.34 to 0.60) and not significantly increasing bleeding risk (HR 1.13, 95%CI 0.39 to 3.26).

We cannot extrapolate this data from people living in remote Australia with a mean age of only 42 years old to other urbanistic and older populations [ 24 ]. This underscores the importance of personalized medicine in interpreting and applying clinical evidence.
Building on the principles of personalized medicine, it is essential to explore how factors such as race and ethnicity influence the effectiveness and safety of aspirin, shedding light on potential disparities in its cardiovascular benefits. Contrary to our results, other studies suggest that low-dose aspirin may not offer the same protective benefits for African Americans as it does for other populations. For instance, one study found that low-dose aspirin did not reduce the risk of fatal heart attacks among African Americans but showed a trend toward a decreased risk in white participants, especially women."
PMC11943274,PMC11943274_chunk_27,"stance, one study found that low-dose aspirin did not reduce the risk of fatal heart attacks among African Americans but showed a trend toward a decreased risk in white participants, especially women. Additionally, African Americans taking low-dose aspirin experienced an 18% increased risk of dying from a heart event, while non-Hispanic white participants had a 14% decreased risk [ 25 ].
These disparities may stem from genetic variations affecting aspirin metabolism, poor control of cardiovascular risk factors, and differences in adherence to aspirin regimens. The medication interactions more common in African American populations could also play a role. Moreover, African Americans have been historically underrepresented in aspirin studies, limiting the applicability of findings to this population [ 25 ].

Beyond biological factors, social and cultural influences may impact aspirin use and its outcomes. Positive peer support and cultural beliefs about aspirin have been linked to higher adoption rates in African American communities. The research in other contexts, such as cancer prevention, has also suggested that aspirin’s effects may vary across racial groups, further highlighting the need to explore these differences in cardiovascular prevention [ 26 ].
These findings underscore the importance of more inclusive research to better understand the relationship between aspirin use, race/ethnicity, and cardiovascular outcomes. Addressing these disparities can guide the development of tailored prevention strategies and improve outcomes for underrepresented populations.

PMC11943274,PMC11943274_chunk_29,"interesting topic regarding cardiovascular prevention is the great interest in simple approaches with wide applicability to address cardiovascular risk factors, including using fixed-dose combination drug regimens, also known as polypills. An individual participant data meta-analysis of three large randomized controlled trials (TIPS-3, HOPE-3, and Polylran) evaluated a fixed-dose combination strategy of at least two blood-pressure-lowering agents plus a statin with or without aspirin. The mean age of the participants was 63 ± 7.1 years old, and the estimated 10-year cardiovascular disease risk was 17.7 ± 8.7%. The group receiving fixed-dose combination strategies including aspirin had a 47% reduction (HR 0·53, 95%CI 0·41 to 0·67; number needed to treat [NNT] 37) in the primary outcome (a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or arterial revascularization), compared with a 32% reduction (HR 0·68, 95%CI 0·57 to 0·81; NNT 66) for fixed-dose combination strategi"

Regarding side effects related to aspirin, they were non-statistically different. This bundle strategy seems to be more effective in older patients (>63 years old) with high or very-high CV risk (10-year CV risk > 9.6%) [ 27 ].
Despite this interesting putative beneficial effect of polypill regimen in a subgroup of patients, the current evidence of using aspirin alone in primary prevention in the general population does not seem to overcome the bleeding risk.
While our analysis provides valuable insights into this important topic, it is not without limitations.

However, it is noteworthy that almost half of the participants had hypertension, a third were on statin therapy, and 14% were diagnosed with diabetes. These cardiovascular risk factors were well represented in the study population, and the results were independent of these factors.
Another acknowledged limitation of our analysis is its retrospective and post hoc nature. Additionally, the lack of data regarding bleeding risk presents a significant drawback, as only hemorrhagic stroke outcomes were collected, showing no differences between groups. Nevertheless, given that no net benefit was observed with antiplatelet medication in this population, the absence of detailed bleeding risk data becomes less critical in this context.

Bleeding after percutaneous coronary intervention remains a substantial clinical challenge, especially in people with acute coronary syndrome who are known to have a greater susceptibility to bleeding and ischaemic events. 1 2 The administration of antiplatelet medications is a major contributing factor to bleeding events following percutaneous coronary intervention, and providing patients with optimal antiplatelet regimens has emerged as a key treatment modifier for maximising the net clinical benefit. 2 The conventional antiplatelet regimen after treating patients with acute coronary syndrome and percutaneous coronary intervention involves dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) using aspirin in combination with a potent P2Y12 inhibitor for 12 months. 1 While this approach effectively reduces the risk of ischaemic events, patients are at a considerable risk of bleeding.

Discussion
This study provides evidence investigating a dedicated antiplatelet regimen for people treated by DCB. We found that stepwise DAPT de-escalation with one month aspirin plus ticagrelor, followed by five months of ticagrelor monotherapy and then aspirin monotherapy, was non-inferior for net adverse clinical events compared with the standard 12 months of DAPT with aspirin plus ticagrelor. Furthermore, if all clinically relevant ischaemic or bleeding events were considered and treated as having hierarchical clinical importance, an overall benefit would have been seen with stepwise DAPT de-escalation compared with standard 12 month DAPT.

Drug eluting stent is generally appropriate for all patients who require percutaneous coronary intervention, however, DCBs are often used for certain indications, as suggested in the consensus documents. 13 28 Therefore, the rates of people with high bleeding risk or small vessel disease and the number of in-stent restenosis or bifurcation lesions are higher in this cohort compared with other studies (eg, TICO, 21 T-PASS, 24 STOPDAPT-2 ACS, 26 and ULTIMATE-DAPT 25 ) that investigated DAPT de-escalation in people with acute coronary syndrome treated with drug eluting stent. However, in our study, the mean device diameter was smaller and the rate of multivessel treatment was lower.

Notably, the proportion of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in our study (17%) is lower than in these other studies, 21 24 25 26 which had rates between 27% and 40%. However, the proportion is similar to previous DCB studies: the proportion of STEMIs in the acute coronary syndrome population was 10% in the BASKET SMALL 2 study; 4 16% in the EASTBOURNE 15 registry, and 19% in the SCAAR 17 registry, whereas patients with STEMI were excluded in the AGENT IDE study. 7 The low proportion of patients with STEMI in studies involving DCBs could be explained by the fact that DCBs are generally not used in the setting of obvious angiographic thrombus, which may inhibit drug delivery to the vessel wall. 39
Notwithstanding this, the thrombotic risk for patients in the present study was similar to previous studies involving DAPT de-escalation after a drug eluting stent. In the STOPDAPT-2 ACS, 26 TICO, 21 T-PASS, 24 and ULTIMATE-DAPT 25 studies,"

In the STOPDAPT-2 ACS, 26 TICO, 21 T-PASS, 24 and ULTIMATE-DAPT 25 studies, the average number of stents used per patient was 1.4, mean device lengths ranged between 32 mm and 38 mm, and the rate of all cause death ranged between 0.7% and 1.2%. Similarly, in the present study, the average number of DCBs used per patient was 1.3, the mean device length was 33 mm, and the rate of all cause death was 1.0%. While risk scores were not reported in the TICO, T-PASS, or ULTIMATE-DAPT studies, in the STOPDAPT-2 ACS study, 16% of patients had a high (≥5) PARIS thrombotic score compared with 22% in the present study.

However, participants who were not adherent to the study protocol were also included in the intention-to-treat population. Conversely, in the per protocol analyses (more than half of the non-adherence was due to switching from ticagrelor to clopidogrel and thus not included in the per protocol population), we found no difference in patient oriented composite endpoint between the strictly ticagrelor based stepwise DAPT de-escalation group (8.1%) and the 12 month DAPT group (8.3%) (appendix).

This disparity between intention-to-treat and per protocol populations was primarily caused by the inclusion or exclusion of patients on clopidogrel based monotherapy. As such, we considered that the 1% higher risk of patient oriented composite endpoint in the intention-to-treat population might be due to the lower potency of clopidogrel based monotherapy compared with protocol-defined ticagrelor based monotherapy. 26 This finding also underscores the importance of adhering to ticagrelor to uphold the efficacy of a P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy based stepwise DAPT de-escalation approach, especially in patients with higher thrombotic risks. 40

Additionally, the selection of suitable patients or lesions for DCB treatment and subsequent procedural techniques were required to follow the recommendations of the German Consensus Group on DCB interventions 28 and the Third Report of the International DCB Consensus Group. 13 Despite the effort, however, compared with real world observational data involving DCB, the current study population was still associated with a relatively lower risk. Of note, when considering the data in daily practice, people who were deemed not suitable for a standard 12-month DAPT due to excessive bleeding risk, such as previous intracranial haemorrhage or required long term oral anticoagulant therapy, were not included.

Compared with de novo lesions, patients with in-stent restenosis were generally associated with a higher ischaemic risk. 13 29 Consequently, our study used stratified randomisation according to whether lesions were de novo or in-stent restenosis. Reassuringly, the effect of the assigned treatment on the incidences of the primary endpoints was consistent across de novo or in-stent restenosis lesion. This effect was also consistent in other prespecified subgroups with higher ischaemic risks, including diabetes, lesion in the proximal vessel, treatment of multivessel disease, complex percutaneous coronary intervention, and high PARIS thrombotic score.

A numerical imbalance in baseline smoking status was noted between the two study groups, however, subgroup analyses showed no significant heterogeneity in treatment effects when comparing people who smoke versus those who do not. Furthermore, the findings remained consistent across both covariate adjusted analyses (smoking status was deemed clinically important and included as a prespecified covariate) and the crude analyses. Therefore, we believe that the numerically greater proportion of smokers in the standard DAPT group was due to chance and had no impact on the robustness of our results.

This endpoint included all cause death, stroke, myocardial infarction, BARC type 3 bleeding, revascularisation, and BARC type 2 bleeding. It is important to note that the clinical importance of all cause death and BARC type 2 bleeding is not equal.

This study has several limitations. Firstly, the sample size calculation for non-inferiority was based on a one sided α of 5%; nevertheless, the sensitivity analysis using a one sided α of 2.5% still showed non-inferiority.

Thirdly, the current study only investigated the impact of a less intensive antiplatelet regimen for acute coronary syndrome patients who received DCB based on indications endorsed by international consensus and the results should not be inferred as supporting the unrestricted use of DCB in all acute coronary syndrome patients. 13 28 Furthermore, only 44% of the participants were diagnosed with STEMI or non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, necessitating caution when generalising the results to these patients.

PMC11968333,PMC11968333_chunk_1,"Introduction
Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) occurring synchronously is a relatively rare presentation. A recent study from 2022 conducted with data from a hospital registry in Singapore found that between 2014 and 2018, the incidence of a concurrent cardiocerebral infarction (CCI) was 0.29% [ 1 ]. Another study published in 2021 with data from a hospital registry in the Philippines found that the prevalence of a synchronous CCI was 0.25% [ 2 ]. There is no literature reporting the prevalence of CCI in the United States.
CCI can be categorized into two subtypes, depending on the timing of the occurrence. Synchronous CCI occurs when the patient presents with simultaneous AMI and AIS, whereas metachronous CCI occurs when one event precedes the other within 72 hours, regardless of the order of presentation of AMI and AIS [ 3 ]. In the Philippines, synchronous CCI has a prevalence rate of 0.9%, whereas metachronous CCI has a prevalence rate of 0.9% to 12.7"

Some of the suggested etiologies of CCI include embolic and hypotensive causes [ 1 ]. Some of the mechanisms cited as embolic causes include a hypokinetic myocardial segment, thrombosis in the presence of a right-to-left shunt, atrial fibrillation, and a ventricular thrombus, while mechanisms under hypotensive causes include atherosclerotic stenosis, aortic dissection, myocardial infarction, and insular infarct with arrhythmia [ 1 ]. The insular cortex is a brain region involved in regulating sympathetic and parasympathetic signaling, and studies show that arrhythmias are more frequent when cerebral ischemia involves the insular cortex than when the insular cortex is not involved [ 4 ].

While the management of either AIS or AMI is well established, there are no clear guidelines for the management of a patient presenting with synchronous AIS and AMI. In addition, aspirin and clopidogrel, used in the management of AMI, can lead to hemorrhagic conversion of an AIS, complicating management further [ 5 ]. Further complicating the management of patients presenting with CCI is the complications that can develop when treating each condition separately. For example, if treatment to salvage the myocardium is initiated first, the delayed management of the ischemic stroke will result in worsening disability, whereas if treatment to salvage the brain tissue is initiated first, the delayed management of the myocardial infarction can result in hypotension or arrhythmias [ 6 ].

Since both AIS and AMI are time-sensitive conditions, delayed interventions may result in permanent disability or even death. Some of the dilemmas encountered in patients who present with CCI include: 1) different dosages of fibrinolytic therapy needed to treat AIS and AMI [ 7 ], 2) use of PCI requires heparin and dual-antiplatelet therapy, both which increase the risk of hemorrhagic conversion in AIS [ 8 ], and 3) risk of myocardial rupture when using thrombolytics in a patient with an acute STEMI [ 9 ]. A review of 25 cases of patients presenting with CCI showed that seven (28%) used mechanical thrombectomy, 15 (60%) underwent PCI, and nine (36%) received alteplase, showing that the management for CCI is individualized [ 7 ].

A similar algorithm has been proposed in a different study, favoring fibrinolysis as an initial treatment strategy in hemodynamically stable patients, followed by endovascular procedures [ 11 ].
The delay in detection of AMI in the patient in this case report was due to the global aphasia associated with his AIS, further complicating the management. One study on patients with CCI found that 83% of patients presented with focal neurological deficits, while 17% presented with AMI symptoms, including dyspnea and chest pain [ 2 ].

Conclusions
Cardiocerebral infarction (CCI) is a relatively rare but deadly condition that necessitates the establishment of clear management guidelines due to its high mortality and challenges in treatment strategies, including the risk of hemorrhagic conversion. This case report highlights the challenges in identifying and managing a patient presenting with CCI. When encountering a patient with a CCI, it is important to determine the hemodynamic stability of the patient, the time since onset of symptoms, and possible etiologies causing the presentation to optimize the management of the patient.

In this case, the AIS was managed first per hospital protocol since the patient arrived with a stroke alert, and the AMI was subsequently managed. This case report contributes to the limited existing literature of patients presenting with CCIs, highlighting a case where a patient presenting with CCI was successfully managed while underscoring the need for guidelines managing of patients with CCIs. Further research needs to be conducted to determine optimal fibrinolytic dosage, determining whether to salvage the brain tissue or myocardium first, and subsequent anticoagulation strategies."
PMC12022475,PMC12022475_chunk_1,"Introduction
Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is characterized by the unexpected formation of intramural haemorrhage within the wall of an epicardial coronary artery with or without an intimal tear, resulting in an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). 1 Approximately 90% of SCAD cases occur in women, and SCAD is a frequent cause of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in young women. 1 A recent study hypothesized that the primary mechanism of SCAD is a disruption of the vasa vasorum resulting in the secondary intramural haemorrhage to form a haematoma, which may obstruct the bloodstream. 2 Haemophilia A and B are inherited X-linked recessive bleeding disorders caused by the absence or dysfunction of clotting factors VIII (FVIII) or IX. Some cohort studies revealed that patients with haemophilia are more likely to develop coronary artery disease, especially AMI, at a younger age despite the presence of bleeding disorders. 3 , 4 However, the mechanisms by which patients with haemophi"

Here, we report the first case of a patient with haemophilia who suffered AMI due to SCAD. We paid special attention to antithrombotic therapy during catheterisation. Further, we used high-resolution coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) to observe the SCAD lesion during the acute and healing phases, which seemed useful for SCAD lesion observation, especially in cases with a high risk of cardiac catheterisation.

Electrocardiography demonstrated no significant ST-segment elevation or depression ( Figure 1A ).

The ACT was reduced from 114 to 80 s and APTT was reduced from 58.7 to 31.1 s after 15 min of administration ( Table 1 ).

This imaging detected the presence of an intramural haematoma and the absence of an intimal tear ( Figure 2C, D, E ). No evidence indicated plaque rupture or erosion, which could have caused the ACS. Therefore, we diagnosed this patient with NSTEMI related to SCAD. Thrombolysis in myocardial infarction III flow was secured; thus, we adopted a conservative approach.

Discussion
We revealed two important clinical issues: (i) SCAD in a male patient with haemophilia and (ii) the usefulness of CCTA to observe SCAD lesions.
First, patients with haemophilia can develop MI due to SCAD. The cause of SCAD frequently includes pre-disposing factors associated with vascular vulnerabilities (e.g. fibromuscular dysplasia, connective tissue disorder or inherited tissue disorder) and precipitating factors such as emotional stress, physical stress (e.g. from an extreme Valsalva manoeuvre, retching, vomiting, coughing or isometric exercise), the use of stimulant medications or illicit drugs and hormonal triggers (e.g. pregnancy). 6 However, 90% of SCAD cases occur in wom"

The proportion of fibromuscular dysplasia is generally lower and physical exertion may trigger SCAD in male patients. 7 In this case, IVUS findings revealed an intramural haematoma without an intimal tear despite the absence of obvious pre-disposing or precipitating factors except for hypertension, which is predominantly observed in patients with haemophilia. Further, the lesion was flanked by arteries of normal calibre, resulting in a type 2A SCAD diagnosis. 1 Considering the hypothesis that the primary mechanism of SCAD is a vasa vasorum disruption resulting in secondary intramural haemorrhage forming a haematoma, in patients with haemophilia, the pre-disposition to bleeding may contribute to the expansion of the haem"

Previous cohorts reporting that patients with haemophilia developed MI at a young age did not include coronary imaging data, and these reports were conducted when SCAD was not well recognized. Therefore, young patients with haemophilia who developed MI may include SCAD cases. The present case does not provide a causal association between SCAD and haemophilia, but reports indicated spontaneous dissections in cervical vessels in a patient with haemophilia. 8 Additional research is required to confirm any potential connection between SCAD and haemophilia, but this report is important to recognize that young patients with haemophilia may be at risk of MI due to SCAD.

Second, CCTA may be a useful means of observing dissection lesions in patients with haemophilia having SCAD. In patients with haemophilia undergoing catheterisation, pre- and post-procedural coagulation factor supplementation is required, and careful attention must be paid to haemorrhagic complications such as haematoma formation at the puncture site. In our case, ultra-high-resolution CCTA confirmed both the flap in the acute phase and its resolution in the chronic phase. Catheterisation is undoubtedly the gold standard for diagnosing SCAD, but CT may be effectively used for follow-up.
Conclusions
We reported the first case of a patient with haemophilia who developed AMI due to SCAD, indicating an interaction in the pathogenesis. A high-resolution CCTA was useful to follow-up on the SCAD lesion.

Design and population
We conducted a longitudinal cohort study using data from the California Teachers Study (CTS) which recruited participants in 1995 and 1996 by mailing questionnaires to all active and recently retired female members of the California State Teachers Retirement System. Participants who returned a self-administered questionnaire ( n = 133 479, median age at enrolment 53 years, range 22–104 years) have been followed prospectively since then, with five subsequent self-administered questionnaires. Additional details regarding CTS have been previously described. 18 , 19
For the current study, all participants who completed the baseline CTS questionnaire were eligible for inclusion from their time of enrolment in CTS to the current administrative end of follow-up (31 December 2020).

Standard protocols and approvals
Institutional Review Board approval was granted through Weill Cornell Medicine as well as the City of Hope National Medical Center to use CTS. Data and statistical code used may be made available to other investigators upon their request to the CTS. We followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines. 20
Exposure
The study exposure was any self-reported history of endometriosis on the baseline questionnaire (1995–1999) or questionnaire four (2005–2008). These two questionnaires are the only ones that asked if a participant has ever had endometriosis. A recent analysis of four international cohor"

A recent analysis of four international cohorts found that self-report of endometriosis on survey questionnaires could be confirmed by reviewing a combination of surgical, clinical, and pathological records in 84% of cases. 21 We report the number of CTS participants who answered that they had endometriosis on the baseline questionnaire and on questionnaire four. We considered participants who reported endometriosis on questionnaire four but not on the baseline questionnaire as having endometriosis throughout the study period because most patients with endometriosis have the onset of symptoms in adolescence and it is considered a disease of the entire reproductive lifespan in females despite significant diagnostic delay in many cases. 22

Results
We included a total of 120 435 participants in our final study cohort ( Figure 1 ). Of these participants, 13 754 (11.4%) reported a history of endometriosis. Compared to participants without endometriosis, those with endometriosis were slightly younger (mean age 53.0 vs. 52.3) and much more likely to have a history of migraine (18.3% vs. 28.7%) and severe anaemia (12.5% vs. 17.4%). Participants with endometriosis were also more likely to report regular use of aspirin (10.5% vs. 12.6%), statin (23.4% vs. 26%), anti-hypertensives (12% vs. 13.7%), and oral contraception (65.5% vs. 74.2%) ( Table 1 ).

Among the 13 754 participants who reported having endometriosis, 10 874 (79%) indicated this diagnosis on the baseline questionnaire and an additional 2880 (20.9%) reported it on questionnaire four. Of the 12 898 participants that reported taking aspirin on the baseline questionnaire, 5546 (43.0%) completed questionnaire four with only 686 of participants reporting that they had stopped taking aspirin on questionnaire four.

The median follow-up time was 25 years [interquartile range (IQR), 21.4–25.2] in participants with endometriosis and 25 years (IQR, 21.5–25.1) in participants without endometriosis. The incidence rate of MACE was 0.74 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.71–0.77] per 100 person-years among participants with endometriosis vs. 0.73 (95% CI, 0.72–0.75) per 100 person-years among participants without endometriosis.

In our age-stratified analysis, we found that endometriosis was most strongly associated with an elevated risk of MACE among participants under 40 years old (IP-weighted HR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.08–2.02). The incidence rate of MACE was 0.14 (95% CI, 0.11–0.19) per 100 person-years for participants with endometriosis, compared to 0.08 (95% CI, 0.07–0.09) per 100 person-years for those without it in this age group ( Table 2 ).

Out of 59 480 participants who completed both the baseline and fourth questionnaires and had no MACE before questionnaire four, 13 127 (22.8%) reported daily statin use. The median follow-up time was 15 years (IQR, 14.3–15.1). Among participants taking statin, the incidence rate of MACE was 1.52 (95% CI, 1.37–1.67) per 100 person-years for participants with endometriosis, compared to 1.55 (95% CI, 1.49–1.62) per 100 person-years for those without (IP-weighted HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.98–1.23).

In the endometriosis subgroup, aspirin use at baseline was associated with increased risk of MACE (IP-weighted HR 1.25; 95% CI, 1.11–1.41). In the non-endometriosis subgroup, aspirin use at baseline was also associated with increased risk of MACE (IP-weighted HR 1.24; 95% CI, 1.18–1.30).
In our study of 120 435 female teachers and administrators in the CTS, those with endometriosis had a higher risk of MACE, especially at younger ages, than those without endometriosis. We found that aspirin did not modify the effect of endometriosis on cardiovascular disease risk. To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to assess aspirin as a potential modifier of MACE risk in patients with endometriosis.

Multiple prior studies have shown that the risk of various adverse cardiovascular events is elevated in patients with endometriosis. 4–6 , 8–10 , 16 , 45 The HR point estimate for MACE in patients with endometriosis in our study was similar to the estimated hazard for cardiovascular disease in three studies, 5 , 8 , 9 , 45 lower than the estimated hazard for coronary heart disease in two studies, 6 , 16 and lower than the estimated hazard for stroke in one study (see Supplementary material online , Table S2 ). 10
Our finding that an increased MACE risk associated with endometriosis was highest before age 40 is also consistent with extant data, though the absolute risk is low. Three previous studies showed a higher risk of coronary heart disease at younger ages in patients with endometriosis. 4 , 6 , 16 Unlike our study, two of these studies "

A variety of mechanistic pathways have been postulated to explain the association between endometriosis and cardiovascular disease. To begin with, patients with endometriosis have cytokine and pro-angiogenic factor release leading to systemic inflammation. 49–52 This systemic inflammation can result in endothelial dysfunction which predisposes to arterial atherosclerotic changes in patients with endometriosis. 53–57 Endometriosis-related pain and stress 58 are also plausibly related to cardiovascular disease via increased inflammation and sympathetic activity. 59 , 60 Additionally, since genetic variants associated with endometriosis 61 , 62 overlap with some genetic variants associated with atherosclerosis resulting in cardiovascular disease, 11 , 63 the observed association between endometriosis and cardiovascular disease may be partially attributed to shared vascular risk factors causing both conditions. However, some vascular risk factors, like dyslipidaemia "
PMC12076410,PMC12076410_chunk_37,"sociation between endometriosis and cardiovascular disease may be partially attributed to shared vascular risk factors causing both conditions. However, some vascular risk factors, like dyslipidaemia 53 , 54 , 64 and smoking, 15 , 65 have mixed evidence for association with endometriosis. Finally, endometriosis treatments 66 , 67 may increase risk of cardiovascular disease, 4 , 9 , 10 though some data indicate that treatment lowers cardiovascular disease risk 5 , 16 or find no difference in risk. 6 , 16
We found that neither aspirin nor statin use is a modifier of the effect of endometriosis on MACE in this cohort. In fact, we found that baseline aspirin use was associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease across the cohort regardless of endometriosis. In a prior study, aspirin use was associated with a higher risk of coronary heart disease in individuals with endometriosis though the authors did not account for differences in baseline indications for aspirin use, such as hi"
PMC12076410,PMC12076410_chunk_38,"use was associated with a higher risk of coronary heart disease in individuals with endometriosis though the authors did not account for differences in baseline indications for aspirin use, such as history of stroke, between groups. 16 One potential reason for our finding is that aspirin use may be associated with severe endometriosis which itself may be associated with substantial risk of cardiovascular disease; aspirin can be used as an analgesic for endometriosis, so patients with more severe endometriosis-related pain may be more likely to use aspirin. 4 Another possibility is that individuals who are regular aspirin users simply have more cardiovascular disease risk from unmeasured confounders (e.g. family history of myocardial infarction at a young age) which we did not account for.

PMC12076410,PMC12076410_chunk_39,"One limitation of our study is a lack of information about indication and duration of aspirin use. Finally, given the unique pathway(s) through which endometriosis increases cardiovascular risk discussed above, aspirin may simply not be an effective method of primary prevention in patients with endometriosis.
Our findings regarding statin use should be interpreted cautiously because questions regarding baseline use were prone to survivorship bias. We also do not know the intensity of statins prescribed.

Participant characteristics
We included a total of 120 435 participants in our final study cohort ( Figure 1 ). Of these participants, 13 754 (11.4%) reported a history of endometriosis. Compared to participants without endometriosis, those with endometriosis were slightly younger (mean age 53.0 vs. 52.3) and much more likely to have a history of migraine (18.3% vs. 28.7%) and severe anaemia (12.5% vs. 17.4%).

Participants with endometriosis were also more likely to report regular use of aspirin (10.5% vs. 12.6%), statin (23.4% vs. 26%), anti-hypertensives (12% vs. 13.7%), and oral contraception (65.5% vs. 74.2%) ( Table 1 ). Among the 13 754 participants who reported having endometriosis, 10 874 (79%) indicated this diagnosis on the baseline questionnaire and an additional 2880 (20.9%) reported it on questionnaire four. Of the 12 898 participants that reported taking aspirin on the baseline questionnaire, 5546 (43.0%) completed questionnaire four with only 686 of participants reporting that they had stopped taking aspirin on questionnaire four.

In our study of 120 435 female teachers and administrators in the CTS, those with endometriosis had a higher risk of MACE, especially at younger ages, than those without endometriosis. We found that aspirin did not modify the effect of endometriosis on cardiovascular disease risk. To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to assess aspirin as a potential modifier of MACE risk in patients with endometriosis.
Multiple prior studies have shown that the risk of various adverse cardiovascular events is elevated in patients with endometriosis. 4–6 , 8–10 , 16 , 45 The HR point estimate for MACE in patients with endometriosis in our study was similar to the estimated hazard for cardiovascular disease in three studies, 5 , 8 , 9 , 45 lower than the estimated hazard for coronary heart disease in two studies, 6 , 16 and lower than the estimated hazard for stroke in one study (see Supplementary material online , Table S2 ). 10

It is also possible that cardiometabolic changes experienced during menopause offset endometriosis-related risk. 48
A variety of mechanistic pathways have been postulated to explain the association between endometriosis and cardiovascular disease. To begin with, patients with endometriosis have cytokine and pro-angiogenic factor release leading to systemic inflammation. 49–52 This systemic inflammation can result in endothelial dysfunction which predisposes to arterial atherosclerotic changes in patients with endometriosis. 53–57 Endometriosis-related pain and stress 58 are also plausibly related to cardiovascular disease via increased inflammation and sympathetic activity. 59 , 60 Additionally, since genetic variants associated with endometriosis 61 , 62 overlap with some genetic variants associa"

In a prior study, aspirin use was associated with a higher risk of coronary heart disease in individuals with endometriosis though the authors did not account for differences in baseline indications for aspirin use, such as history of stroke, between groups. 16 One potential reason for our finding is that aspirin use may be associated with severe endometriosis which itself may be associated with substantial risk of cardiovascular disease; aspirin can be used as an analgesic for endometriosis, so patients with more severe endometriosis-related pain may be more likely to use aspirin. 4 Another possibility is that individuals who are regular aspirin users simply have more cardiovascular disease risk from unmeasured confounders (e.g. f"

The quality and effectiveness of pharmaceutical formulations depend on precise and reliable analytical techniques. Ensuring drug safety and regulatory compliance requires robust methods for accurately quantifying active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and detecting impurities that could compromise drug stability and patient health. Simultaneously quantifying multiple APIs remains a significant challenge, particularly in drug combinations like atorvastatin (ATO) (Fig. 1 a) and aspirin (ASP) (Fig. 1 b), which are widely used for cardiovascular disease prevention 1 , 2 .

Traditional methods such as high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), spectrofluorimetry, spectroscopy, and capillary electrophoresis are commonly employed for impurity quantification. Integrating impurity profiling into analytical method development strengthens drug quality assessment and ensures adherence to regulatory standards. Recent advancements underscore the need for more sensitive and selective techniques to enhance drug purity and efficacy 3 – 7 .
This study aims to develop an accurate and efficient first-derivative synchronous fluorescence spectrofluorimetric (FDSFS) method for simultaneously determining ATO and ASP in bulk powders and pharmaceutical formulations.

These features make SFS highly effective for analyzing multi-component mixtures without requiring pre-separation steps. Combining SFS with derivative techniques further improves sensitivity and selectivity by reducing spectral overlap, a common limitation of traditional fluorescence methods. These advantages make it a promising approach for monitoring drug quality through trustworthy analytical techniques to ensure patient safety 9 – 13 .

Conventional and synchronous spectrofluorimetric methods have yet to be utilized for analyzing the binary mixture of ASP and ATO in biological fluids or pharmaceutical dosage forms due to significant fluorescence spectral overlap. This limitation makes conventional fluorometric methods unsuitable for precise estimation. However, FDSFS effectively overcomes this obstacle by utilizing derivative amplitude measurements, which provide additional advantages in selectivity and sensitivity.
Fluorometric techniques offer significant advantages over simpler and cost-effective methods, such as spectrophotometry and electrochemical analysis.

Additionally, they achieve lower detection limits and higher specificity in complex pharmaceutical matrices, making them invaluable for routine quality control 27 – 33 .
As sustainability becomes a growing priority, analytical method development must align with the principles of Green Analytical Chemistry (GAC) to minimize environmental impact. GAC emphasizes reducing hazardous chemicals, limiting waste production, and optimizing energy efficiency throughout method development. The FDSFS method exemplifies this approach by significantly minimizing the use of hazardous solvents and reducing energy consumption, making it an environmentally friendly alternative to conventional techniques.

To ensure its sustainability, standardized greenness assessment tools, including the Analytical Greenness Metric (AGREE), the Complex Multi-Objective Green Analytical Procedure Index (Complex MOGAPI), and the National Environmental Methods Index (NEMI), have been applied. These tools evaluate solvent selection, waste reduction, and energy efficiency, providing a comprehensive assessment of the method’s green profile. By integrating GAC principles and utilizing well-established assessment tools, the FDSFS method achieves a balance between analytical efficiency and environmental responsibility, paving the way for more sustainable practices in pharmaceutical and chemical analysis 34 – 41 .

By effectively addressing excipient interactions, this method guarantees reliable, interference-free drug quantification under all conditions 42 .
For any analytical technique to be widely adopted, it must demonstrate feasibility in real-world pharmaceutical applications.

Synchronous fluorescence spectra were recorded by scanning both monochromators at a constant Δλ of 80 nm. The first derivative of each synchronous spectrum was obtained using a data interval of 15 points at 384 nm and 365 nm for ATO and ASP, respectively, and the corresponding peak amplitudes were measured.

The optimal Δλ value is critical for achieving peak sensitivity, resolution, and overall performance in the synchronous fluorescence scanning (SFS) method. This parameter directly impacts both the intensity of the synchronous signal and the spectral profile. To assess its effect, a broad Δλ range (20–120 nm) was examined for ATO and ASP. The results indicated that 80 nm was the optimal Δλ, producing two well-defined peaks with ideal spectral shapes. In contrast, lower Δλ values led to reduced fluorescence intensity, while excessively low values caused spectral distortion for both drugs.

To assess the impact of pH on the fluorescence intensity of ASP and ATO (Fig. 6 b), two buffer types were tested: 0.2 M acetate buffer (pH 4.5–5.6) and 0.2 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.0–7.0). The results revealed that ASP exhibited its highest fluorescence intensity and stability in mildly acidic conditions, with a peak at pH 5.0.

Findings and discussions
In ethanol, Aspirin (ASP) and Atorvastatin (ATO) exhibit native fluorescence at 405 nm and 364 nm, respectively, when excited at 285 nm and 300 nm (Fig. 2 ). These excitation wavelengths were selected based on their intrinsic fluorescence properties, ensuring optimal excitation of each analyte to generate a strong and distinguishable emission signal. However, due to significant spectral overlap (Fig. 2 ), conventional fluorescence techniques lack sufficient selectivity for simultaneous determination.

To address this limitation, synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy (SFS) was employed to enhance selectivity and facilitate the differentiation of both drugs. Figure 3 a shows the synchronous fluorescence spectra of ATO at varying ASP concentrations, while Fig. 3 b illustrates the SFS spectra of ASP in the presence of different ATO concentrations. Despite applying SFS, considerable spectral overlap persisted, posing a challenge for independent quantification.

The first derivative synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy (FDSFS) was applied to enhance selectivity and eliminate spectral interference (Fig. 4 a, b). Under optimized conditions (Fig. 5 ), ATO was accurately determined at 384 nm, while ASP was quantified at 365 nm. The selection of Δλ = 80 nm was systematically optimized to enhance spectral resolution and minimize peak overlap. This choice provided multiple analytical advantages, including suppression of background fluorescence, improved differentiation between ATO and ASP signals, and an enhanced signal-to-noise ratio, leading to superior fluorescence intensity and analytical precision.

Robustness
The robustness of the proposed method was evaluated by making minor adjustments to the optimized conditions, including slight variations in pH (± 0.1) and phosphate buffer volume (± 0.1 mL) while maintaining all other parameters unchanged. Each factor was altered individually to assess its impact on method performance.
Notably, these small modifications did not significantly affect the fluorescence intensity, demonstrating the method’s reliability under slightly varied conditions. As shown in Table 1 , the percentage RSD remained below 2%, confirming the robustness of the proposed approach.

Outcomes after acute myocardial infarction (MI) can be improved by lifestyle changes; control of cardiovascular risk factors; and treatment with secondary preventive medications, such as aspirin, P2Y12-inhibitors, statins, beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), and/or angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs), all of which are recommended in international guidelines [ 1 – 3 ].
Suboptimal treatment after MI has been repeatedly observed, with too few patients initiated on recommended secondary preventive treatments and many patients showing insufficient adherence to medication [ 4 – 13 ]. Poor adherence to prescribed secondary preventive drugs has been found to adversely affect prognosis [ 6 , 9 – 12 ].
About 6–8% of patients who experience MI are diagnosed with myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) [ 14 , 15 ]. Although this disorder was first recognized in the early 1980’s [ 16 – 18 ], diagnostic criteria and treatment r"

Although this disorder was first recognized in the early 1980’s [ 16 – 18 ], diagnostic criteria and treatment recommendations for MINOCA have only recently been established [ 2 , 19 , 20 ]. An AHA scientific statement from 2019 suggests that secondary preventive therapies might be considered on an individual basis in patients with MINOCA [ 20 ]. The guidelines from European Society of cardiology from 2020 recommend that patients with MINOCA, of unknown cause, might be followed-up similarly to patients diagnosed with MI with obstructive coronary arteries (MI-CAD), and be treated according to secondary prevention guidelines for atherosclerotic disease (class IIb recommendation) [ 2 ]. Recommendation on duration of the treatment is however scarce. The percentage prescribed secondary preventive drugs has been shown to be lower in patients with MINOCA than in those with MI-CAD in clinical routine [ 21 ,"
PMC12101741,PMC12101741_chunk_3,"uration of the treatment is however scarce. The percentage prescribed secondary preventive drugs has been shown to be lower in patients with MINOCA than in those with MI-CAD in clinical routine [ 21 , 22 ]. However, knowledge is lacking regarding adherence to medical treatment in patients with MINOCA and whether the different medication adherence measures, including initiation, implementation, and persistence rates of secondary preventive drug treatment differ between patients with MINOCA and MI-CAD. We therefore aim to evaluate the adherence to guideline recommended medications in patients with MINOCA and MI-CAD.
Methods
The present study is a Swedish nationwide register-based cohort study, based on the 155,518 unique patients in the SWEDEHEART registry [ 23 ], who were hospitalised due to acute MI and discharged between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2017.

Patient with at least one coronary stenosis ≥50% at coronary angiography were labelled MI-CAD and patients without were labelled MINOCA. Patients were excluded if they did not undergo in-hospital diagnostic coronary angiography, if their result of the coronary angiography was unknown, died within 30 days after discharge, or were receiving automatically dispensed doses of medication before admission to hospital. Patients who previously underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) were included in the MI-CAD group independently on findings at the latest coronary angiography. The final study cohort consisted of 116,378 individuals, 9138 with MINOCA and 107,240 with MI-CAD ( Fig 1 ).

Data on medication at hospital admission and hospital discharge were retrieved from the SWEDEHEART registry. Data regarding filled prescriptions for medications 6 months before hospital admission, and 1 and 6 months and 1–3 and 5 years after hospital admission, were retrieved from the Prescribed Drug Register.
Data on prescriptions for the following pharmaceuticals were included: acetylsalicylic acid (ATC-code B01AC06); P2Y12-inhibitors (B01AC04, B01AC22 and B01AC24); statins (C10AA and C10BA); beta blockers (C07); ACEs/ARBs including fixed combinations with thiazides (C09); Vitamin K antagonists (B01AA03); and novel oral anticoagulants (B01AE07, B01AF01, B01AF02 and B01AF03).

The study was approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board in Stockholm (diary number: 2012/60–31/2) and by the Swedish Ethical Review Authority (diary number: 2020–04252).
All three constructs of adherence to medication, namely initiation, implementation and persistence, were evaluated [ 26 ]. In assessing adherence to medication only patients who received their first prescription for the above-mentioned drugs at hospital discharge were included, to minimize selection bias, as the prevalence of medications at admission differed significantly in the MINOCA and MI-CAD cohorts.

The time of follow-up was divided into six periods, 2–6 months, 6–12 months, 1–2 years, 2–3 years and 3–5 years ( Fig 2 ).
Initiation was defined as the percentage of patients who had a drug prescription from a physician and dispensed the drug at a pharmacy within 30 days after discharge. Only patients who initiated medication were included in further analyses of implementation, discontinuation and persistence of that drug class.
Drug implementation, defined as the extent to which a patient’s actual dosing regimen corresponded to the prescribed dosing regimen, was estimated by determining the medication possession ratio (MPR) [ 26 , 27 ]. Briefly, for each time-period, the number of days a drug was available was divided by the number "

Briefly, for each time-period, the number of days a drug was available was divided by the number of days in that time-period. Stockpiling was included. The proportion of days with drug available was categorized as <50%, 50–80% and 80–100%, with an MPR ≥ 80% defined as high implementation [ 6 , 9 , 11 , 12 , 26 , 28 , 29 ].
Persistence in the present study was defined as the length of time between initiation and discontinuation of medical treatment. Patients were regarded as taking a drug as long as the prescription was refilled within the estimated time of the previous prescription, including drugs carried over from previous prescriptions. A grace period of 45 days was allowed, in which patients were considered continuously exposed to a drug if they refilled a prescription within 45 days after the estimated completion of previous prescriptions ( Fig 2 ).

The 45-day grace period were used to establish a reasonable balance between the need for monitoring short-term implementation and long-term persistence [ 27 ].
Patients were allowed to switch between drugs within the same drug class and still be considered persistent. If a patient failed to fill a new prescription within a given time, the date of non-persistence was defined as the calculated end of supply from the most recent prescription, including any stockpiling. On the first day of each interval, the proportion of persistent patients was calculated by dividing the number of persistent patients by the number of patients remaining in the cohort.

Patients who discontinued treatment were labeled non-persistent. Those who restarted treatment after being considered non-persistent were followed as a separate restarter group. The group users was defined as the sum of persistent and restarting patients. This provided an opportunity to capture patients restarting treatment after non-persistence and to calculate the actual proportion of patients receiving treatment at a certain time. The proportion of persistent patients at different time points was calculated by dividing the number of persistent patients by the number of patients remaining in the cohort at the first day of each interval,

Patients with MINOCA were as expected less often prescribed and initiated on treatment with all assessed drug classes than patients with MI-CAD ( S1 Table ).
Implementation, defined as the extent to which a patient’s actual dosing regimen corresponded to the prescribed dosing regimen, was highest at the beginning of follow-up and declined slowly over time. However, the proportions of patients with high implementation to treatment with aspirin, ACEI/ARBs, and beta blockers during all time periods were high in both the MINOCA and MI-CAD groups. The proportion of patients with high implementation to treatment with statins was lower in both the MINOCA and MI-CAD groups ( Figs 3 and 4 , S2 Table ).

Patients with MINOCA had lower persistence to all studied drug classes than patients with MI-CAD ( Figs 5 and 6 , S1 Table ). The addition of restarting to persistent patients increased the rates of users of all classes of drugs, thus the difference between MINOCA and MI-CAD remained. Multivariable logistic regression analyses, after adjustment for relevant covariates, showed that persistence at 12 months remained significantly lower in the MINOCA than in the MI-CAD group ( Table 2 ).

Prescription and initiation
Patients with MINOCA were as expected less often prescribed and initiated on treatment with all assessed drug classes than patients with MI-CAD ( S1 Table ).
Implementation
Implementation, defined as the extent to which a patient’s actual dosing regimen corresponded to the prescribed dosing regimen, was highest at the beginning of follow-up and declined slowly over time. However, the proportions of patients with high implementation to treatment with aspirin, ACEI/ARBs, and beta blockers during all time periods were high in both the MINOCA and MI-CAD groups.

Persistence
Patients with MINOCA had lower persistence to all studied drug classes than patients with MI-CAD ( Figs 5 and 6 , S1 Table ). The addition of restarting to persistent patients increased the rates of users of all classes of drugs, thus the difference between MINOCA and MI-CAD remained.

Discussion
This nationwide registry-based study investigated and compared the initiation, implementation and persistence rates of secondary preventive medications in patients with MINOCA and MI-CAD. Patients with MINOCA were less frequently prescribed secondary preventive medications at discharge, showed a lower rate of filling their first prescriptions, and had lower implementation and persistence rates than patients with MI-CAD.
The proportion of patients with high implementation decreased slowly over time, although >90% of patients in both groups initiated on aspirin, beta blockers, and ACEI/ARBs maintained a MPR ≥ 80% during the entire follow-up period. The decreasing proportion of patients taking "

The decreasing proportion of patients taking these medications over time is in agreement with several previous studies in patients with MI [ 6 , 9 , 10 , 12 ]. A recent study of statin implementation among patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease showed that only 21.4% had high implementation during the first year, decreasing to 19.8% at 3 years [ 28 ]. The different results between our study and this study may be due in part to different compositions of study cohorts and methodological differences in assessing implementation. The present study only measured implementation in patients who were persistent or labeled as users both at the beginning and the end of a time period, to avoid mix up non-implementation and non-persistence, whereas previous studies did not. Furthermore, implementation in the present study was calcul"

Furthermore, implementation in the present study was calculated using shorter time intervals at the start of follow-up because change of medications, side effects, and subsequent discontinuation may be more frequent at the beginning of treatment.
The present study found that the persistence of aspirin and statins in patients with MINOCA was in agreement with the results of previous studies assessing the persistence in MI patients at 12–18 months [ 5 , 7 , 8 ]. The rates of persistence of all medications throughout the entire follow-up period were higher in the present MI-CAD cohort than in previous studies [ 5 , 7 , 8 ]. The latter results are in agreement with a previous Swedish study investigating the long-term use of low-dose aspirin for both primary- and secondary prevention, with approximately 15% of those patients discontinuing long-term asp"

In contrast, the proportion of MINOCA patients in the present study who discontinued aspirin treatment was higher. However, the previous study found that patients who discontinued aspirin had a 37% higher rate of cardiovascular events after 3 years than those who were persistent [ 30 ]. The applicability of these findings to patients with MINOCA remains to be determined.
Several principal differences between patients with MINOCA and MI-CAD may affect the initiation, implementation, and persistence of secondary preventive medical treatment. First, the uncertainty of the diagnosis of MINOCA may affect both the attending physicians and patients’ willingness to prescribe medications and follow the prescription, respectively. The cause of MINOCA remains uncl"
PMC12101741,PMC12101741_chunk_37,"ainty of the diagnosis of MINOCA may affect both the attending physicians and patients’ willingness to prescribe medications and follow the prescription, respectively. The cause of MINOCA remains unclear in many patients [ 2 , 20 , 31 , 32 ]. Thus, patients with MINOCA are less likely to be prescribed secondary preventive medications, less often undergo structured follow-up, and less frequently achieve secondary preventive targets than patients with MI-CAD [ 33 , 34 ].
As recent guidelines recommend all patients with an initial working diagnosis of MINOCA follow a diagnostic algorithm, including a cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) exam, to determine the underlying diagnosis [ 2 , 20 ] the previously experienced uncertainty should decrease with time. Henceforth, a CMR exam with an ischemic late gadolinium enhancement pattern that strengthens the indication for secondary preventive medical treatment, as it carries a more serious prognosis than a non-ischemic pattern, may improve both the "
PMC12101741,PMC12101741_chunk_38,"ate gadolinium enhancement pattern that strengthens the indication for secondary preventive medical treatment, as it carries a more serious prognosis than a non-ischemic pattern, may improve both the prescription of secondary preventive medications and follow-up [ 35 – 38 ].
Second, the characteristics of patients with MINOCA differ from those with traditional MI. MINOCA patients tend to be younger, are more often women, and have fewer traditional risk factors for atherosclerotic heart disease [ 14 , 15 , 39 ]. Women with MI have been found to be less likely than men to receive evidence-based therapies and have lower referral rates for cardiac rehabilitation [ 5 , 13 , 40 , 41 ]. Our subgroup analysis on women showed that the implementation of aspirin and statins were significantly higher in patients with MI-CAD than in those with MINOCA, whereas there was no difference in implementation rates of ACE/ARBs and beta blockers. Furthermore, persistence rates remained significantly higher i"
PMC12101741,PMC12101741_chunk_39,"in patients with MI-CAD than in those with MINOCA, whereas there was no difference in implementation rates of ACE/ARBs and beta blockers. Furthermore, persistence rates remained significantly higher in women with MI-CAD than in women with MINOCA, indicating that factors other than gender are important. Gender, however, may have a larger impact on the implementation and persistence of statins as perceived muscle symptoms associated with statin use are more common in women than in men [ 42 , 43 ].
None of the MINOCA patients in the present study had undergone a coronary intervention. MI patients treated without PCI are less frequently prescribed secondary preventive drugs than patients who undergo PCI (7). Prior cardiovascular treatment has also been associated with high long-term implementation of secondary preventive treatment [ 44 ]. In contrast, patients with asymptomatic disease may be less adherent [ 13 , 45 ].
Psychosocial factors may differ in patients with MINOCA and MI-CAD. Pre"

Psychosocial factors may differ in patients with MINOCA and MI-CAD. Previous Swedish studies have indicated that pre-existing psychiatric disorders are more common in patients with MINOCA [ 46 , 47 ]. Moreover, patients with MINOCA were found to have lower rates in the dimensions of vitality and mental health at 3 months follow-up than patients with MI-CAD [ 46 , 47 ]. Other psychosocial factors, such as perceived social support and sense of coherence, have been associated with long-term adherence to secondary preventive measures in patients with MI [ 48 ]. Psychological belief and attitude are important in unintentional non-adherence, and beliefs about medication are important in intentional non-adherence [ 49 ].

A recent consensus document discussing adherence to secondary preventive therapy after cardiovascular diseases, recommended focus on all the five dimensions of adherence to therapy simultaneously; including the patient, the disease, the therapy, the healthcare provider and the healthcare system [ 13 ]. Thus, improving medical adherence requires both time and commitment. Novel interventions like digital health tools and follow-up programs that are both structured and individualized may contribute to an improvement of future secondary preventive medical treatment after both MINOCA and MI-CAD, but should preferably be studied in randomized trials.

Furthermore, restricting the assessment of implementation and persistence only to patients who had a de novo prescription for each indicated class of drugs reduced the influence of on-going prescriptions on long-term persistence.
However, this registry-based analysis had several limitations. The analysis relied on ICD-codes and the possibility of coding errors cannot be ruled out.

On the first day of each interval, the proportion of persistent patients was calculated by dividing the number of persistent patients by the number of patients remaining in the cohort. Only patients with a de novo prescription of a drug class were included in analysis of that drug class. Patients with ongoing treatment or a prescription 6 months prior to myocardial infarction were excluded from analysis of that drug class.

The mean overall DPI treatment duration in the HF cohort was 437.1 ± 177.9 (median 443; IQR, 371-550) days. In the no HF cohort the DPI duration was similar with a mean of 450.0 ± 202.37 (median 470; IQR, 365-583) days. There was no important difference in the proportion of patients of patients who permanently discontinued DPI therapy (HF, 19.6%; no HF, 21.9%). Of the remaining, the proportion of patients without interruption to their DPI therapy was similar in the HF and no HF cohorts (92.2% vs 92.3%).
During the study period, 4.9% (n = 43) of the HF cohort experienced a major adverse coronary event compared with 2.4% (n = 77) in those without HF, with an adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of 1.57 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-2.41; Table 2 ; Fig. 1 ).

The mean overall DPI treatment duration in the HF cohort was 437.1 ± 177.9 (median 443; IQR, 371-550) days. In the no HF cohort the DPI duration was similar with a mean of 450.0 ± 202.37 (median 470; IQR, 365-583) days. There was no important difference in the proportion of patients of patients who permanently discontinued DPI therapy (HF, 19.6%; no HF, 21.9%). Of the remaining, the proportion of patients without interruption to their DPI therapy was similar in the HF and no HF cohorts (92.2% vs 92.3%).
Clinical events
During the study period, 4.9% (n = 43) of the HF cohort experienced a major adverse coronary event compared with 2.4% (n = 77) in those without HF, with an adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of 1.57 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-2.41; Table 2 ;"

Discussion
Patients with ASCVD and concomitant HF who are treated with DPI therapy show twice the rate of MACE, driven by an increase in MI and CV death, compared with those without HF. Treatment with DPI therapy was not associated with an increased risk of major bleeding between patients with and without HF.
Historical trials that examined the use of vitamin K antagonists in patients with HF without evidence of atrial fibrillation, showed a lack of clinical benefit and increased risk of bleeding. 15 In the COMPASS trial, participants with chronic coronary artery disease or peripheral artery disease were randomized to rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily with 100 mg of aspirin, rivaroxaban 5 mg twice daily, or aspirin 100 mg alone.

In the trial, 5902 patients had a history of HF, of whom 12 had an EF of ≤ 40% with EF ≤ 30% as an exclusion criterion. This substudy showed that although patients with and without HF showed a similar relative risk reduction for MACE, there was a considerably larger absolute risk reduction of 2.4% in the HF cohort and 1.0% in the no HF cohort. 11 They also showed no significant difference in major bleeding among patients with or without HF (3.3% vs 1.9%).
The treatment arm of the COMPASS trial is the only relevant comparator to the presented registry study, which includes a similar population of patients with stable ASCVD ( Table 4 ). Among patients with HF in the XATOA registry, we observed a similar rate of MACE compared with patients with HF in the COMPASS trial (5.0% over 15 months vs 5.5% over 23 months) and a lower risk of major bleeding (0.9% vs 2.5%; "

This is despite that the XATOA registry included more symptomatic HF patients, a greater proportion of patients with an EF ≤ 40%, and those with more comorbidities. The results of the present XATOA registry analysis and subgroup analysis of the COMPASS trial show that patients with an EF ≤ 40% who are receiving DPI therapy have a higher rate of MACE compared with those with an EF > 40% (COMPASS: EF ≤ 40% = 10.2%; EF > 40% = 4.8%; XATOA: EF ≤ 40% = 8.8%, EF > 40% = 3.5%).

However, the XATOA registry included more symptomatic patients with HF and a higher burden of comorbidities compared with those in the COMPASS trial, suggestive against the presence of a significant selection bias. However, it is important to highlight that those in the COMPASS trial and XATOA registry are patients with ASCVD who initiate DPI therapy. This population varies significantly from traditional HF cohorts, which exclude patients with an alternative indication for anticoagulation such as atrial fibrillation and have more stable HF. This makes it challenging to contrast our cohort with other HF cohorts and partially explains why a paucity of HF events were observed. Compared with clinical trials, observational cohorts such as XATOA are at risk of lower ascertainment of bleeding events.

PMC12105749,PMC12105749_chunk_49," of lower ascertainment of bleeding events. Although this might lead to an underestimation of bleeding results in the overall cohort, it is less likely to detract from an analysis comparing subgroups in the cohort. Additionally, pragmatic cohorts without event and/or clinical adjudication are susceptible to higher rates of missing data (such as EF). Despite a nearly equal distribution of ASCVD in men and women, women are under-represented in the XATOA registry (21.8%), highlighting the continued need for focused efforts to improve diversity in CV research. 16 Our results should be interpreted in the context of these limitations.
Overall, we showed that in a generalizable population of patients with coronary artery disease or peripheral artery disease and concomitant HF, the rates of adverse clinical events and bleeding are similar to those in recent clinical trials.

Although patients with an EF of ≤ 40% who are receiving DPI therapy have higher rates of CV events with DPI therapy compared with those with an EF > 40%, previous studies have suggested they might also receive a greater benefit from the use of DPI therapy. On the basis of the cumulative experience from the current study and previous trials, DPI therapy should be strongly considered in patients with ASCVD and concomitant HF.

PMC12121825,PMC12121825_chunk_1,"Introduction
Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide [ 1 ]. International guidelines recommend secondary preventive treatment, including control of cardiovascular risk factors; lifestyle changes; and secondary preventive medications to improve outcome after acute myocardial infarction (MI) [ 2 , 3 ].
Poor medication adherence to secondary preventive therapy with aspirin, P2Y12-inhibitors, statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs)/angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) and beta blockers have repeatedly been demonstrated [ 4 – 7 ] and shown to unfavourably affect the prognosis [ 4 , 5 , 8 ]. According to a large meta-analysis, approximately 9% of all cardiovascular events in Europe may have been caused by poor medication adherence [ 4 ].
Myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) affect approximately 6–8% of all patients with MI [ 9 , 10 ]. Specific secondary preventive strategies for MINOCA were propos"

Myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) affect approximately 6–8% of all patients with MI [ 9 , 10 ]. Specific secondary preventive strategies for MINOCA were proposed recently by both the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) [ 11 ] and the American Heart Association (AHA) [ 12 ]. In the guidelines from ESC, patients with MINOCA of unknown cause may be treated according to secondary prevention guidelines for atherosclerotic disease (class IIb recommendation) and followed-up in the same way as patients diagnosed with MI with obstructive coronary arteries (MI-CAD). Hence, antiplatelet agents should be used to reduce risk for thrombotic events, statins to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (LDL-C) to a sufficient level and blood-pressure agents to target age appropriate blood-pressure levels [ 3 , 11 ].

The scientific statement from AHA also recommends that all modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease should be treated aggressively in MINOCA patients with any evidence of atherosclerosis [ 12 ]. Furthermore, previous observational studies indicate long-term beneficial effects of treatment with secondary preventive medications, achieving target range LDL-C and participation in exercise training programs [ 13 – 16 ].
The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between persistence to secondary preventive medications and long-term prognosis in patients with MINOCA and MI-CAD.
Methods
In this nationwide, observational, registry-based cohort study all patients diagnosed with acute MI and registered in the Swedish Web-system for Enhancement and Development of Evidence-based care in Heart disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapies (SWEDEHEART) registry [ 17 ] between January 1, 2006 and Decemb"

This large nationwide registry-based study demonstrated for the first time a strong association between the persistence to secondary preventive medication and prognosis in patients with MINOCA. The risk reducing effect is in the same magnitude for patients with MINOCA as for patients with MI-CAD, further strengthening the indications for secondary preventive medical treatment in MINOCA.
International guidelines from both the ESC [ 3 ] and AHA [ 2 ] have advocated the importance of secondary preventive medical treatment after MI, including aspirin, beta blockers, ACEI/ARI and statins. Since these guidelines mainly apply to patients with MI-CAD, the secondary preventive medical treatment of patients with MINOCA has been more arbitrary and dependent on individual physicians’ considerations. However, since 2019 there are recommendations from both ESC and AHA proposing MINOCA specific secondary preventive treatments with focus on reducing risk factors for cardiovascular disease [ 11 , "

In the present study persistent use of the secondary preventive medications aspirin, ACEI/ARB, beta blockers and statins, were associated with a decrease in the risk of the composite endpoint (MACE) in both MINOCA and MI-CAD patients. The results for MI-CAD is in concordance with several previous observational studies [ 4 , 5 , 8 ].
A strong covariation in persistence to one or more secondary preventive medications was demonstrated in the present study. To distinguish the prognostic effect of one individual group of drugs among the use of several others may therefore be challenging. Furthermore, patients who are persistent to secondary preventive drugs are also adherent to other secondary preventive interventions as well. In this study, patient with long-term persistence to statins t"
PMC12121825,PMC12121825_chunk_32,"hermore, patients who are persistent to secondary preventive drugs are also adherent to other secondary preventive interventions as well. In this study, patient with long-term persistence to statins tended to cease smoking, participate in physical activities and reach desired LDL-C goals at 12 months to a larger degree. This is in agreement with previous studies showing that patients initiating and adhering to secondary preventive treatments for lowering LDL-C and blood-pressure are more likely to engage in other health-promoting behaviors [ 23 – 25 ]. It is therefore always important to acknowledge the “healthy adherer” effect in studies evaluating the effects of therapies on health outcomes [ 26 ].
The differences between studies in the method used to measure persistence may make comparing results more complex [ 27 ]. The present study applied a strict initial definition, measuring persistence only in patients with primary adherence to treatment, and a less rigid follow-up approach i"

The present study applied a strict initial definition, measuring persistence only in patients with primary adherence to treatment, and a less rigid follow-up approach including patients who restarted treatment in the user group. Both of these factors may have resulted in higher levels of persistence at later time points than observed with other approaches, but may better reflect real world conditions.
However, the results are in agreement with a previous review of five adjusted observational studies, which indicated survival benefits of statins, beta blockers and dual antiplatelet therapy and reduced risk for MACE of ACEI/ARB among patients with MINOCA [ 13 ]. Similar positive effects were found in a small observational study suggesting longer survival in MINOCA patients treated with statin and ACEI/ARB [ 16 ] and in large observational study indicating long-term beneficial effects of treatment with statins and ACEI/ARB on MACE in patients with MINOCA an"

In this nationwide registry-based study, almost all patients hospitalized in Sweden for acute MI in 2006–2017 were included allowing analyses of large and unselected patient cohorts. The results reflect real-life practice as contrary to the setting of randomized controlled trials, thereby enhancing the generalizability. A nationwide registry with consecutive enrollment reduced the selection bias associated with studies of patients at selected hospitals or subscribed in a particular health care insurance system.

With today’s increased availability to cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), had some patients likely been diagnosed with an alternative diagnose such as myocarditis and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Secondary preventive treatments specific for MINOCA were not proposed until year 2019 (AHA) and 2020 (ESC) and the prescription of secondary preventive drugs before then are unsystematic. However, the MINOCA patients evaluated in the present study were prescribed secondary preventive medications based on the assessment of the physician in charge of discharge.
Conclusions
Persistence to secondary preventive medications after MI is associated with a reduction in the risk for MACE in both patients with MINOCA and MI-CAD. Continuous efforts to improve adherence to evidence-based medications in general to all patients with MI should be a priority.

STOPDAPT-3 ( NCT04609111 ) was a physician-initiated, prospective, multicenter, open-label, adjudicator blinded randomized clinical trial where we compared the bleeding and cardiovascular outcomes between an experimental group of 1-month prasugrel monotherapy without aspirin and a control group of 1-month DAPT with aspirin and prasugrel in patients planned for PCI using cobalt-chromium everolimus-eluting stent (CoCr-EES: Xience TM series, ABBOTT Vascular) implantation. The detailed study protocol and main results are reported elsewhere. 11 The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the Ethical Guidelines for Medical and Health Research Involving Human Subjects in Japan. In brief, a total of 6,002 patients with acute coronary syndrome regardless of Academic Research Consortium high bleeding risk (ARC-HBR) or non-acute coronary syndrome with high bleeding risk were enrolled between January 2021 to April 2023 from 72 centers in Japan, and were rando"

After randomization, a loading dose of prasugrel 20 mg was administered in both groups. A loading dose of aspirin 162–200 mg was also administered in aspirin-naïve patients in the DAPT group. Prasugrel 3.75 mg/day in the no-aspirin group, and aspirin 81–100 mg/day and prasugrel 3.75 mg/day in the DAPT group were continued up to 1 month after PCI. At the 1-month (30–59 days) visit, prasugrel was switched to clopidogrel and was continued up to 1 year in the no-aspirin group, while prasugrel was discontinued and aspirin monotherapy was continued up to 1 year in the DAPT group.

Multivessel PCI targets were presented in 92.6% of patients with a mean number of target lesions of 2.4, and 10.0% of patients had a chronic total occlusion target. Intravascular imaging was used in 93.1% of patients. Baseline characteristics were well balanced between the no-aspirin and DAPT groups, except for the higher prescription rate of proton-pump inhibitors in the DAPT group compared with the no-aspirin group.

Baseline Characteristics
There were 401 patients in the no-aspirin group and 413 patients in the DAPT group ( Figure 1 ). In the total study population, the mean age was 71.0 years, 78.6% of the patients were men, and 83.7% of the patients presented as acute coronary syndrome ( Table 1 ). The mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 58.3 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , and the prevalence of moderate (eGFR 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) and severe (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 or hemodialysis) chronic kidney disease was 40.5% and 10.0%, respectively.

Multivessel PCI targets were presented in 92.6% of patients with a mean number of target lesions of 2.4, and 10.0% of patients had a chronic total occlusion target. Intravascular imaging was used in 93.1% of patients. Baseline characteristics were well balanced between the no-aspirin and DAPT groups, except for the higher prescription rate of proton-pump inhibitors in the DAPT group compared with the no-aspirin group.

Discussion
The main findings of the present STOPDAPT-3 subgroup analysis are as follows: (1) an aspirin-free prasugrel monotherapy relative to DAPT failed to reduce major bleeding within 1 month in patients undergoing staged PCI; and (2) an aspirin-free prasugrel monotherapy relative to DAPT had a numerically higher incidence of cardiovascular events within 1 month in patients undergoing staged PCI.

P2Y 12 inhibitor monotherapy after very short DAPT (1–3 months) compared with standard DAPT reduced major bleeding events without increasing cardiovascular events after PCI in several randomized clinical trials. 19 – 23 However, if patients required staged PCI procedures, they were enrolled after the completion of the final staged PCI procedures, and therefore, those who experienced bleeding or ischemic complications at the staged PCI were often not enrolled in these trials. Therefore, data of the optimal duration of DAPT in patients requiring staged PCI were scarce.

The removal of aspirin might be ineffective in reducing procedure-related bleeding.
Several single-arm studies reported that an aspirin-free strategy immediately after PCI was not associated with any spontaneous myocardial infarction or stent thrombosis in selected low-risk patients. 8 – 10 However, because patients requiring staged PCI were not enrolled in these studies, the safety of an aspirin-free strategy for patients undergoing staged PCI has not been evaluated so far.

Conclusions
An aspirin-free prasugrel monotherapy relative to DAPT had numerically higher risks of cardiovascular and major bleeding events in patients undergoing staged PCI at 1 month. The findings of the present study should be considered as hypothesis generating because of the post hoc and underpowered subgroup analyses of the overall STOPDAPT-3 trial, which was negative for the co-primary bleeding endpoint. Further investigations of an aspirin-free prasugrel monotherapy relative to DAPT should be mandatory for these patients.

PMC12223531,PMC12223531_chunk_1,"Introduction
Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of mortality worldwide [ 1 ], responsible for over 17.3 million deaths annually, a number projected to increase to 23.6 million by 2030 [ 2 ]. Coronary artery and peripheral vascular disease are the primary contributors to the global burden of CVD [ 3 ]. Projections from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 study estimated a 90 % increase in cardiovascular prevalence, a 73.4 % rise in crude mortality, and a 54.7 % growth in crude disability-adjusted life years between 2025 and 2050, with cardiovascular deaths anticipated to climb from 20.5 million in 2025 to 35.6 million by 2050 [ 4 ]. In Europe, CVD account for 39 % of all deaths in men and 46 % of all deaths in women [ 5 ], whereas in the United States, coronary heart disease causes one in seven deaths [ 6 ], with heart failure responsible for one in nine [ 6 ]. Despite reductions in overall CVD mortality in South Korea, ischemic heart disease remains a growing conce"

Despite reductions in overall CVD mortality in South Korea, ischemic heart disease remains a growing concern [ 7 ]. The primary driver of these diseases is arterial thrombosis resulting from atherosclerosis, often triggered by plaque rupture [ 8 ]. While platelets are critical for maintaining hemostasis under normal conditions, they can become hyperactivated, leading to thrombotic complications [ 9 , 10 ]. Such complications including ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction underscore the importance of targeting platelet activation and thrombus formation to prevent and manage CVD [ 11 , 12 ].
In recent years, natural compounds have been recognized as safer alternatives to traditional synthetic drugs for managing inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases [ [13] , [14] , [15] , [16] , [17] ]. Among these, ginseng, particularly Panax ginseng , has been particularly valued for its well-documented"
PMC12223531,PMC12223531_chunk_3,"rugs for managing inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases [ [13] , [14] , [15] , [16] , [17] ]. Among these, ginseng, particularly Panax ginseng , has been particularly valued for its well-documented health benefits [18] , [19] , [20] . Ginsenosides, the active saponins derived from ginseng, are known for their anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and cardioprotective properties [ 18 , 21 ]. Ginseng can improve endothelial function [ 22 ], reduce oxidative stress [ 23 ], and regulate lipid metabolism [ 24 ], all of which are beneficial for heart health. On the other hand, the utility of current synthetic antiplatelet therapies, such as aspirin and P2Y12 inhibitors, although effective, is often limited by adverse effects such as gastrointestinal bleeding, platelet resistance, and increased bleeding risks, especially with long-term use [ 25 ]. These adverse effects underscore the need for safer and more effective alternatives. Therefore, ginseng and its constituents, such as ginsenoside Rg5,"
PMC12223531,PMC12223531_chunk_4,"ding risks, especially with long-term use [ 25 ]. These adverse effects underscore the need for safer and more effective alternatives. Therefore, ginseng and its constituents, such as ginsenoside Rg5, may offer promise in terms of its ability to enhance cardioprotection while causing minimal adverse effects compared to its conventional synthetic counterpart treatments.
Rg5 is a minor ginsenoside, resulting from the deglycosylation of Rb1 and dehydration at carbon position 20 of Rg3 [ 26 ]. Unlike major ginsenosides, Rg5 exhibits enhanced pharmacological properties, including antitumor, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, neuroprotective, and cardioprotective activities [ 26 ]. Rg5 enhances vascular health by promoting neovascularization and vasorelaxation through insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) activation, which triggers angiogenic signaling, thereby improving endothelial function under pathological conditions [ 27 ]. Additionally, it protects cardiomyocytes from ischemic i"

Additionally, it protects cardiomyocytes from ischemic injury by modulating mitochondrial dynamics via hexokinase-II (HK-II) and dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), suppressing Drp1 activation and promoting HK-II binding through Akt activation [ 28 ]. Rg5 has been reported to inhibit arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation, highlighting its potential as an antiplatelet agent [ 29 ]. However, while previous studies have screened Rg5 for its antiplatelet activity, we provide the first mechanistic evidence of its specific antiplatelet effects (Graphical abstract). These findings support the hypothesis that Rg5 may offer a promising therapeutic option, providing enhanced cardioprotection while potentially reducing the adverse effects associated with conventional synthetic treatments.

Results
Fig. 1 A illustrates the molecular structure of ginsenoside Rg5. Light transmission aggregometry was performed by incubating hPRP with Rg5 at concentrations of 35, 50, 75, and 100 μM, in the presence of collagen (2.5 μg/mL) ( Fig. 1 B), thrombin (2.5 U/mL) ( Fig. 1 C), and U46619 (200 nM) ( Fig. 1 D). Rg5 significantly inhibited collagen-induced platelet aggregation at 35 μM and fully inhibited it at 100 μM.

In contrast, Rg5 at 35 μM did not significantly affect thrombin (2.5 U/mL), and U46619 (200 nM) induced platelet aggregation but significantly inhibited aggregation at concentrations between 50 and 100 μM. These results suggest that Rg5 strongly inhibits platelet aggregation through the collagen receptor (GPVI) pathway. The IC 50 of Rg5 was calculated to be 42.5 μM ( Fig. 1 E). This value indicates the potency of Rg5 in inhibiting platelet aggregation in our experimental setup. The cytotoxicity of Rg5 was evaluated using an LDH leakage assay ( Fig. 1 F). Our results demonstrated that Rg5 at 35–100 μM concentrations did not induce significant cytotoxicity in platelets, indicating its safety at these concentrations.

Rg5 (35–100 μM) strongly inhibits collagen-induced platelet granular release and related signaling pathways in human platelets ( Fig. 2 ). The results highlight the dose-dependent modulation of calcium mobilization, granular secretion, and the expression of associated proteins. A significant and dose-dependent reduction in intracellular calcium levels was observed ( Fig. 2 A), indicating a direct impact on platelet activation signaling. Further, our results show that Rg5 significantly suppresses serotonin release with stronger inhibition at higher doses ( Fig. 2 B).

The inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type I (InsP 3 R) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) regulate intracellular Ca 2+ concentration [ 30 ]. Myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS), binds to actin and is phosphorylated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a PKC activator and plays a role in platelet exocytosis [ 31 ]. Our Western blot results indicated the molecular changes induced by Rg5, including the upregulation of p-InsP 3 R and the downregulation of p-ERK and p-MARCKS, relative to β-actin ( Fig. 2 E). These findings suggest that Rg5 strongly modulates critical signaling pathways involved in platelet activation.

Discussion
Rg5 inhibited collagen, thrombin, and U46619-induced platelet aggregation, with the strongest effect on collagen-induced aggregation via the GPVI receptor ( Fig. 1 ). These results suggest that Rg5 preferentially targets GPVI-mediated signaling pathways, which are critical for platelet activation and thrombus formation [ 33 , 34 ]. Further, our data reveal that Rg5 significantly inhibits intracellular calcium mobilization ([Ca 2+ ]i), a key secondary messenger in platelet activation [ 35 , 36 ]. The observed reduction in calcium signaling by Rg5 affects InsP3R function and suppresses upstream signaling proteins, such as p-cPLA 2 and p-p38 ( Fig. 2 A and E). These molecules are critical regulators of calcium release from intracellular stores, and their inhibition by Rg5 suggests a direct interference with pathways essential for platelet activation as reported pr"
PMC12223531,PMC12223531_chunk_50,"olecules are critical regulators of calcium release from intracellular stores, and their inhibition by Rg5 suggests a direct interference with pathways essential for platelet activation as reported previously and recently [ [37] , [38] , [39] ]. Furthermore, Rg5 reduced ATP and serotonin release, key markers of dense granule secretion, in a dose-dependent manner ( Fig. 2 B and C). This indicates suppression of platelet degranulation, an essential step for sustained platelet activation and recruitment. The reduction in CD62P (P-selectin) expression further confirms the inhibition of α-granule release ( Fig. 2 D). This plays a significant role in platelet-platelet and platelet-endothelium interactions during thrombus formation [ 40 ].
Rg5 significantly inhibited TXB 2 production, a stable metabolite of TXA 2 , an inducer of platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction [ 41 ]( Fig. 3 ). The downregulation of p-cPLA 2 , a key enzyme in TXA 2 synthesis, further supports the ability of Rg5 to i"
PMC12223531,PMC12223531_chunk_51,"tabolite of TXA 2 , an inducer of platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction [ 41 ]( Fig. 3 ). The downregulation of p-cPLA 2 , a key enzyme in TXA 2 synthesis, further supports the ability of Rg5 to inhibit TXA 2 signaling [ 42 ]. Rg5 also inhibited thrombin-induced clot retraction, an integrin αIIbβ3-mediated process that contributes to thrombus stabilization [ 43 ]( Fig. 4 ). This effect was accompanied by an increase in clot area, indicating that it disrupts the final common pathway of platelet aggregation, which involves these molecules bridging activated platelets [ 44 ].
Western blot analysis revealed that Rg5 downregulated key signaling proteins involved in platelet activation, including p-ERK, p-p38, p-Syk, and p-GSK-3α/β ( Fig. 5 A). These kinases are critical mediators of GPVI, thrombin, and TX receptor signaling [ 45 ]. Notably, the inhibition of p-Syk and p-ERK highlights the ability of Rg5 to interfere with the early stages of GPVI-mediated signaling cascades. Interestingl"

Notably, the inhibition of p-Syk and p-ERK highlights the ability of Rg5 to interfere with the early stages of GPVI-mediated signaling cascades. Interestingly, Rg5 upregulated the phosphorylation of VASP at Ser157 and Ser239, which are associated with increased cAMP and cGMP signaling, respectively. One possible explanation is that Rg5 may modulate VASP phosphorylation through alternative pathways, such as inhibition of phosphodiesterase enzymes or direct effects on PKA and (PKG ( Fig. 5 B). Rg5 inhibited collagen + oxLDL-induced CD162 (PSGL-1) expression ( Fig. 5 C). This is a critical finding because CD162 is involved in platelet-leukocyte interactions, playing an important role in inflammation and atherothrombosis [ 46 ]. OxLDL is known to enhance platelet activation through pathways involving CD162 and other adhesion molecules [ 46 , 47 ]. By inhibiting platelet-leukocyte aggregation, Rg5 not only attenuates platelet aggregation but also r"
PMC12223531,PMC12223531_chunk_53,"nce platelet activation through pathways involving CD162 and other adhesion molecules [ 46 , 47 ]. By inhibiting platelet-leukocyte aggregation, Rg5 not only attenuates platelet aggregation but also reduces the inflammatory component of thrombus formation.
I n vivo, FeCl 3 -induced thrombosis model in mice provided further evidence of its antithrombotic potential, with 20 mg/kg Rg5 significantly prolonging occlusion time and reducing thrombus formation more effectively than aspirin ( Fig. 6 ) [ 10 , 48 ].
Rg5 inhibits platelet activation and thrombus formation while demonstrating no cytotoxicity, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic agent for thrombotic cardiovascular diseases. Compared to conventional antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin, Rg5 offers a broader spectrum of activity with potentially fewer adverse effects.

Furthermore, it is crucial to identify the specific molecular targets of Rg5 and its interactions with other signaling pathways for advancing the clinical development of this compound. In conclusion, this study provides novel mechanistic insights into the antiplatelet activity of Rg5, demonstrating its potential as a safer and more effective therapeutic agent to prevent thrombotic disorders.

Immediate transition to double therapy was associated with similar in‐hospital mortality, major bleeding, ICH, and NACEs compared with those receiving an initial course of triple therapy post‐PCI, although we did observe a signal for a slightly higher incidence of stent thrombosis (absolute difference 0.3%) in those transitioning to a single antiplatelet agent on day 1 post‐PCI. This higher risk appeared to be driven by patients with STEMI. Although an immediate double therapy approach appears safe in select patients, randomized controlled trials are required to definitively answer this question.

Although statistically nonsignificant, nearly all the point estimates in our study favored an initial course of triple therapy, and more studies will be needed to examine whether such concern is valid. We observed a small but statistically significant increase in stent thrombosis among those receiving immediate double therapy, driven by a difference in patients with STEMI. This difference was preserved even after IPTW was performed, suggesting stronger evidence. A trend toward increased risk of stent thrombosis in patients receiving double therapy was observed in some, but not all, randomized trials on this topic. 5 , 6 , 7 However, meta‐analyses have found that the modest increase in ischemic risk is generally outweighed by the significant reduction in bleeding risk. 12 , 13 , 14 This suggests that the highest risk subgroup of patients, such as those presenting with STEMI, may benefit from an init"

The strengths of our study include a large sample size from >1000 US hospitals. However, its limitations include the observational design, which may introduce confounding and bias when attempting to draw conclusions around causal inference. Additionally, 31.5% of patients were excluded due to missing medication data, which could introduce selection bias. The complexity of intervened lesions, severity of comorbid conditions, and duration of triple therapy were not accounted for in our analysis because of lack of granular details.

In conclusion, many cardiologists are transitioning their patients with AF to double therapy immediately following PCI, despite the lack of randomized controlled evidence for this approach. Our study suggests that this is likely safe for select patients with AF following PCI. However, we observed a signal for increased risk of stent thrombosis with immediate double therapy in select populations, specifically those presenting with STEMI. This suggests that the highest risk subgroups of patients likely benefit from an initial course of triple therapy before transitioning to double therapy. Future randomized trials are needed to determine which patients require an initial short course of triple therapy before transitioning to double therapy in patients with AF post‐PCI and, if so, to establish the optimal duration.

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) is a common, costly, and potentially life-threatening disease [ 1 ]. It must be managed promptly and appropriately to prevent adverse outcomes [ 1 ]. Peptic ulcer bleeding is the most common type of UGIB, accounting for 31–67% of all cases, followed by erosive disease, variceal bleeding, esophagitis, malignancies, and Mallory-Weiss tear [ 1 , 2 ]. In the U.S., the annual rate of hospitalization for peptic ulcer disease and UGIB is estimated to be 165 per 100,000 in 1999—more than 300,000 hospitalizations per year, at a cost of $2.5 billion [ 3 , 4 ]. After antimicrobial drugs became available to eradicate H. pylori, the hospitalization rate for peptic ulcer disease decreased to 56.5/100,000 in 2005 (95% CI 54.6–58.3) [ 5 ]. Furthermore, despite advances in therapy, the mortality rate has remained unchanged at 7–10% [ 6 ]. This may be because today’s patients are older and have more comorbidities than did patients in the past [ 7 ].

UGIB can produce hypovolemia, hypotension, and diminished oxygen-carrying capacity, which causes myocardial ischemia and necrosis [ 8 – 11 ]. Prior studies of UGIB and AMI are small, and long-term effects of UGIB on AMI have not been delineated. In addition, all the previous studies focused on the simultaneous presentation of AMI and UGIB [ 8 – 11 ], and the subacute and long-term effects of UGIB on the subsequent risk of AMI in CAD patients were still unclear, even though the impact of UGIB is expected to be larger in CAD patients [ 9 , 10 ]. Therefore, we did a population-based, nested case-control study to investigate UGIB and the subsequent AMI risk in CAD patients.

To prevent AMI and subsequent mortality and morbidity, early referral of CAD patients with UGIB for additional evaluation and treatment may be needed.
Other studies have reported that the prevalence of AMI in patients with UGIB ranges from 1% to 14% [ 8 – 11 ]. There is no general agreement about risk stratification of AMI in patients with UGIB. Some studies [ 8 – 11 , 13 , 14 ] suggest that those with a greater number of coronary risk factors, a history of CAD, lower blood pressure on admission, older age, severe illnesses, or lower hemoglobulin have a greater risk of AMI.
There are two scenarios between UGIB and AMI. The first one is that UGIB predisposes a patient to develop AMI, and the second is that AMI predisposes a patient to develop UGIB. Cappell (2000) suggested that when UGIB precipitates an AMI, it tends to be acute and massive, whereas UGIB precipitat"
PMC4631331,PMC4631331_chunk_22,"to develop AMI, and the second is that AMI predisposes a patient to develop UGIB. Cappell (2000) suggested that when UGIB precipitates an AMI, it tends to be acute and massive, whereas UGIB precipitated after an AMI has been treated tends to be self-limited and often resolves with the reversal of underlying coagulopathy [ 15 ]. We found that UGIB has a continuing potential to induce a subsequent AMI in CAD patients. This may be because of (i) anemia and hypoperfusion: AMI secondary to ischemia may be due to a decrease in the body’s oxygen supply. Bellotto (2005) showed that hemoglobin ≤ 8.2 g/dL was a significant risk factor for myocardial necrosis [ 8 ]. Activating the sympathetic nervous system can increase demand for myocardial oxygen and worsen ischemia; or (ii) discontinuing of antiplatelet use: antiplatelet drug therapy, such as aspirin and clopidogrel, should be continued to reduce the risk of plaque rupture and recurrent AMI. In the present study, UGIB [+] AMI [+] patients used"
PMC4631331,PMC4631331_chunk_23,"atelet use: antiplatelet drug therapy, such as aspirin and clopidogrel, should be continued to reduce the risk of plaque rupture and recurrent AMI. In the present study, UGIB [+] AMI [+] patients used less aspirin than did UGIB [+] AMI [−] patients. Aspirin was always discontinued after UGIB because aspirin doubles the risk of bleeding ulcers, even at doses as low as 75 mg daily [ 16 ]. Aspirin is first-line, because of its low cost and comparable efficacy, and clopidogrel is reserved for patients who cannot tolerate aspirin [ 17 ]. The combination of clopidogrel and aspirin may reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, but it raises the risk of hemorrhage [ 17 ]. In total, 64.7% AMI [+] patients have antiplatelet therapy (aspirin, clopidogrel, or both), which was a relative low percentage. There was no report about the compliance of antiplatelet therapy in patients with CAD in Taiwan. However, a study about antihypertensive medication compliance in Taiwan reported only 53% of the pati"
PMC4631331,PMC4631331_chunk_24,". There was no report about the compliance of antiplatelet therapy in patients with CAD in Taiwan. However, a study about antihypertensive medication compliance in Taiwan reported only 53% of the patients had high compliance with antihypertensive medication [ 18 ], which may be due to the characteristics of this population. The present study also showed UGIB [+] AMI [+] patients took more proton pump inhibitors and more H 2 receptor blockers than did UGIB [+] AMI [−] patients, which suggested that both of these two drugs may not reduce the AMI risk in UGIB [+] patients.
In the subgroup analysis, we found that women and patients < 65 years old had twice the risk of developing an AMI than did CAD patients without UGIB, which has never been reported before. Other studies [ 8 – 11 , 13 , 14 ] reported that older age is a risk factor and simultaneous UGIB and AMI occurred most often in men.

PMC4631331,PMC4631331_chunk_25,"reported that older age is a risk factor and simultaneous UGIB and AMI occurred most often in men. Although our data do not give us sufficient information to explain this apparent discrepancy, we hypothesize that women and patients < 65 have fewer comorbidities than do men and the elderly; therefore, UGIB is the most likely factor that contributes to AMI.
This study has some limitations. First, the comorbidities relied on the claims data and ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes, which may have resulted in disease misclassification. However, many studies have validated that ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes of NHIRD have a high sensitivity and specificity for the actual diagnosis [ 19 – 21 ]. Second, the NHIRD contains no information on the severity of UGIB and AMI; therefore, we were unable to evaluate the severity association between them. Third, some important laboratory data, such as hemoglobin concentrations, and drugs, such as NSAIDs (nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs) and SSRI (selective serotonin r"

Third, some important laboratory data, such as hemoglobin concentrations, and drugs, such as NSAIDs (nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs) and SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), were not available in the NHIRD, therefore, we could not interpret the available results fully and adjust for these variables as contributing factors in this study. Further study about this issue is warranted. Fourth, whereas we observed a temporal association between UGIB and AMI, we were unable to provide the risk estimates of AMI within certain periods of time (e.g. 1, 6, or 12 months of the bleed) and what percentage of patients discontinued aspirin or changed antiplatelet therapy which may affects subsequent AMI. However, this study showed that AMI [+] patients who were also UGIB [+] took less aspirin and less aspirin + clopidogrel than did AMI [+] patients who were UGIB [−] , which was an indirect evidence of discontinue for aspirin.

In addition, while diminished oxygen carrying capacity following UGIB is a plausible explanation, the presentation of AMI in such cases would be acute rather than subacute. A cohort study that recruits a group of CAD patients who have UGIB and follows them over time for AMI episodes after the UGIB including discontinue of aspirin is needed to obtain such estimates. Fifth, we did not identify the origin of UGIB and recurrent UGIB. However, the aim of this study was to evaluate whether CAD patients have a higher risk of developing AMI after UGIB, and therefore further studies that identify the origin of UGIB and recurrent UGIB are warranted for developing more specific prevention strategies.

This is the first nationwide population-based, nested case-control study to clarify that CAD patients, especially women and those < 65 years old, have twice the risk of developing an AMI after UGIB than do CAD patients who do not have UGIB. Therefore, early referral of CAD patients who develop UGIB for additional evaluation and treatment, including a modification of antiplatelet therapy, is needed to lower the risk of developing AMI."
PMC4691662,PMC4691662_chunk_1,"Introduction
While non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the most widely used drugs, especially among the elderly, who frequently use them on a long-term basis, the benefit–risk balance of individual NSAIDs is chiefly driven by their gastrointestinal and cardiovascular (CV) safety profile, and there have been many studies regarding each outcome. In a recent meta-analysis, the pooled adjusted rate ratio of gastrointestinal complications ranged from 1.81 to 4.22, while the rate ratio for CV complications was estimated around 1.3 among NSAIDs including celecoxib. 1 However, diabetes is a well-known risk factor for CV outcomes which has also been suggested to be an independent risk factor for peptic ulcer bleeding, contributing a population attributable fraction of 4%. 2 Moreover, the 2014 Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes recommend aspirin as a primary prevention for those with increased CV event risk. 3 However, according to the American College of Gastroenterology Guide"
PMC4691662,PMC4691662_chunk_2," the 2014 Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes recommend aspirin as a primary prevention for those with increased CV event risk. 3 However, according to the American College of Gastroenterology Guidelines for Prevention of NSAID-Related Ulcer Complications (ACG Guideline), concurrent use of any one drug among aspirin, corticosteroids, or anticoagulants with NSAIDs is one of the indicators applied to define the group at higher risk of NSAID-induced gastrointestinal toxicity regardless of doses. 4 Therefore, patients with diabetes, who receive prophylactic aspirin, are inevitably at risk of both gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and CV events caused by NSAIDs.
However, beyond the risks from the unavoidable use of aspirin among patients with diabetes with high CV event risk, such patients are at further risk of negative CV outcomes from the use of NSAIDs other than aspirin. The safety profile of different NSAIDs among the group of those at high risk of CV events is not clear and difficult "
PMC4691662,PMC4691662_chunk_3,"at further risk of negative CV outcomes from the use of NSAIDs other than aspirin. The safety profile of different NSAIDs among the group of those at high risk of CV events is not clear and difficult to study by clinical trial due to ethical issues. Furthermore, even though celecoxib was determined to be safe with regard to CV complications, unlike rofecoxib, 5 the association between cyclooxygenase (COX) 2 selectivity and NSAID complications in real-world settings among those at high risk of CV events is an issue that requires further study. Moreover, NSAIDs known to have stronger COX-2 selectivity than celecoxib, such as meloxicam and nimesulide, as well as new COX-2 inhibitors such as etoricoxib, are currently on the market. There are earlier studies looking for an association of aspirin use with CV events among patients with and without diabetes, but none have evaluated the use of other NSAIDs. 6 7 Therefore, we conducted a cohort study on elderly patients with diabetes to assess G"
PMC4691662,PMC4691662_chunk_4,"n use with CV events among patients with and without diabetes, but none have evaluated the use of other NSAIDs. 6 7 Therefore, we conducted a cohort study on elderly patients with diabetes to assess GIB and CV outcomes of NSAID users compared to non-users, and to identify differences in the risk of each outcome associated with different kinds of NSAIDs.
Methods
Ninety-seven percent of citizens of the Republic of Korea (hereafter, Korea) are covered by the national health insurance system and therefore have equal access to healthcare services. The Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA) database, which contains all the reimbursed claims of medication and medical procedures between January 2008 and December 2012 of the 50 million total residents of Korea, was used.

We identified new users and non-users of NSAIDs (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical code M01A) among patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (ICD-10 code E10-14) in the claims database between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2011.

Patients in both groups had to be at least 65 years old on the index date with no prescription of NSAIDs in the previous year to apply a new-user design in order to control for prevalent user bias such as underestimating early events and altering disease risk factors related to the study drugs. 8 Therefore, NSAID users were selected from the year 2009 to 2011, and among these users, those who had received NSAID prescriptions in 2008 were excluded ( figure 1 ). The risk of GIB among NSAID users is reported to decrease markedly 7 days after cessation, owing to the reversibility of the COX inhibition by NSAIDs. 9 However, since elderly patients often receive NSAIDs occasionally, NSAID u"

The event rates during exposed and non-exposed periods in NSAID users and non-users were calculated applying exposed periods of users to the matched non-users. Multiple prescriptions of different NSAIDs were regarded as exposure to each different NSAID at that time when the risks of outcomes were compared among different kinds of NSAIDs.

In Korea, one's diagnosis is cumulatively recorded in the claims database, making it difficult to determine whether or not the outcome is secondary.

CV events included acute myocardial infarction (I21) and ischemic stroke (I63). Outcomes were assessed from the index date until the last day of the study, assigning a range of 1–4 years of follow-up.

Recent use of the following medications was identified: antihypertensive agents, anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, aspirin, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), gastroprotective agents (GPAs), corticosteroids, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).

GPA included H2 receptor antagonists (H2RA), sucralfate, misoprostol, and rebamipide, the last of which is a cytoprotectant commonly used in Asian countries but not approved in the USA. Comorbidity was defined as having been diagnosed at least 1 year prior to the index date, and recent medication use was defined as having been prescribed no more than 1 year prior to the index date and during the follow-up period before the event occurred.

In order to select comparable participants from the NSAID user and non-user groups as well as from users of COX-2 selective inhibitors (coxibs) among NSAIDs, propensity score matching on a 1-to-1 basis was used. Covariates proven to be adequate for propensity score matching in the association between NSAIDs and upper gastrointestinal toxicity such as prior use of warfarin or oral steroids and a history of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, heart failure, and coronary artery disease were included on the basis of an earlier study, and other factors that are potential covariates in the relationship between NSAID use and CV events such as a history of dyslipidemia or atrial fibrillation, and previous use of aspirin, antiplatelets, and SSRIs were also included. 11 The variables previously used to calculate the propensity score of selecting coxibs and NSA"

The balance after matching was evaluated by methods such as histogram plots, c-statistics, and the standardized differences between the two groups. Among these, standardized difference is known as the most effective way to measure balance considering differences <10% to be well balanced. 13 Also, the event rates during non-exposed periods in NSAID users and non-users using the exposed periods of the matched users were compared in order to clarify residual confounding after propensity score matching.

The incidence rate (IR) with a 95% CI per 1000 person-years and incidence rate ratio (IRR) of GIB and CV events were estimated.

GIB was defined as gastric, duodenal, peptic, or gastrojejunal ulcer with hemorrhage or perforation (ICD-10 code K250, K251, K252, K254, K255, K256, K260, K261, K262, K264, K265, K266, K270, K271, K272, K274, K275, K276, K280, K281, K282, K284, K285, K286), acute hemorrhagic gastritis (K290), hematemesis (K920), melena (K921), or unspecified GI hemorrhage (K922). CV events included acute myocardial infarction (I21) and ischemic stroke (I63). Outcomes were assessed from the index date until the last day of the study, assigning a range of 1–4 years of follow-up. Death was treated as a competing risk s"

Death was treated as a competing risk since it could happen before the outcome of interest in the elderly population. Only the first events were identified among multiple events, and when the two events occurred on the same day, they were both counted. Previous diagnosis of the following diseases was noted: hypertension, dyslipidemia, coronary artery disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation/flutter, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, liver disease, and renal failure. Recent use of the following medications was identified: antihypertensive agents, anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, aspirin, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), gastroprotective agents (GPAs), corticosteroids, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).

In case of patients with diabetes who regularly visit clinics for their antidiabetics, NSAIDs including aspirin are generally obtained not over the counter but from their physicians due to their cheaper cost under national insurance coverage. Liver disease included alcoholic liver disease, toxic liver disease, hepatic failure, chronic hepatitis, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (K70, K71, K72, K73, K76), and renal failure included acute renal failure, chronic kidney disease, and unspecified kidney failure (N17, N18, N19). GPA included H2 receptor antagonists (H2RA), sucralfate, misoprostol, and rebamipide, the last of which is a cytoprotectant commonly used in Asian countries but not approved in the USA.

Comorbidity was defined as having been diagnosed at least 1 year prior to the index date, and recent medication use was defined as having been prescribed no more than 1 year prior to the index date and during the follow-up period before the event occurred.
Statistical analyses
In order to select comparable participants from the NSAID user and non-user groups as well as from users of COX-2 selective inhibitors (coxibs) among NSAIDs, propensity score matching on a 1-to-1 basis was used. Covariates proven to be adequate for propensity score matching in the association between NSAIDs and upper gastrointestinal toxicity such as prior use of warfarin or oral steroids and a history of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, heart failure, and coronary artery disease were included on the basis of an earlier study, and other factors that are potential covariates in the relationship between NSAID use and CV events such as a history of dyslipidemia or atrial fibrilla"

The balance after matching was evaluated by methods such as histogram plots, c-statistics, and the standardized differences between the two groups. Among these, standardized difference is known as the most effective way to measure balance considering differences <10% to be well balanced. 13 Also, the event rates during non-exposed periods in NSAID users and non-users using the exposed periods of the matched users were compared in order to clarif"

We treated death as a competing risk to model the subdistribution hazard function. 14 There were a total of 504 patients who died during the study period before the outcome occurred with an all-cause mortality of 4290 per million. The incidence rate (IR) with a 95% CI per 1000 person-years and incidence rate ratio (IRR) of GIB and CV events were estimated. The crude and adjusted HRs (aHRs) and 95% CIs of both outcomes were calculated for NSAID users versus non-users using univariate and multivariate Cox regression models.

The aHRs were adjusted for age, sex, comorbid conditions, and recent medications, all of which are listed in the tables. In the case of PPI and GPA users, early signs of GIB such as gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, peptic ulcer, gastritis, epigastric pain, or dyspepsia were additionally adjusted for to prevent protopathic bias. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS Enterprise Guide, V.6.1 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina, USA).
Results
From the 1.7 million patients with diabetes aged over 65 years among the entire national population, 206 591 patients were eligible to be in the NSAID user group and 145 850 patients to be non-users. After following the exclusion criteria described previously, the two groups had 151 790 and 92 343 patients, respectively. By 1-to-1 propensity score matching, 58 805 patients i"

By 1-to-1 propensity score matching, 58 805 patients in each group were selected, comprising a total of 117 610 study subjects ( figure 1 ). Before propensity score matching, the NSAID users and non-users differed in age, comorbidities, and recent medications, while the propensity score-matched cohort resulted in a good balance in all characteristics according to histograms and standardized mean differences <0.1 with a c-statistic of 0.763 ( table 1 ).

During 4 years of follow-up, 2184 first episodes of GIB (1354 in NSAID users vs 830 in non-users) and 9333 episodes of myocardial infarction or stroke (5043 in NSAID users vs 4290 in non-users) were identified.

Discussion
Even though coxibs are known to have a low risk of GIB among NSAIDs, their CV risk must also be taken into account. However, diabetes is a well-known risk factor of CV diseases, and thus patients with diabetes often receive prophylactic aspirin, which increases the risk of GIB. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the risk of both GIB and CV outcomes among patients with diabetes, comparing NSAID users to non-users, and also to discover different risks among different NSAIDs. All of the IRRs of GIB and CV events exceeded 1 and were at least marginally significant among aged patients with diabetes with various comorbidities and recent medications, indicating a higher risk of both outcomes within patients with diabetes, except for CV events in patients with rheumatoid arthritis where the IRR was not significant due to the small number of patients in this g"
PMC4691662,PMC4691662_chunk_32,"a higher risk of both outcomes within patients with diabetes, except for CV events in patients with rheumatoid arthritis where the IRR was not significant due to the small number of patients in this group. This implies the need to assess the additional risk of both CV events and GIB in patients with diabetes who were being prescribed NSAIDs.
The risk of GIB was higher among patients with liver disease and renal failure. Patients with cirrhosis may develop GIB resulting from esophageal or gastric varices. However, patients with non-cirrhosis liver disease as defined in this study, who probably would have no varices, were also vulnerable to GIB, which indicates that patients with liver disease have a higher risk of non-variceal GIB when treating NSAIDs. Also, in another study, patients with hepatic disease and renal disease had a higher risk of upper gastrointestinal complications from peptic ulcer disease caused by NSAIDs. 15 However, patients with end-stage renal disease are documented"
PMC4691662,PMC4691662_chunk_33,"hepatic disease and renal disease had a higher risk of upper gastrointestinal complications from peptic ulcer disease caused by NSAIDs. 15 However, patients with end-stage renal disease are documented to have a higher risk of peptic ulcer bleeding owing to mechanisms such as platelet dysfunction and blood coagulation abnormalities, 16 and acute renal failure is also proposed to be associated with upper GIB. 17 According to the ACG Guideline, users from the elderly population of any one of anticoagulants, aspirin, and corticosteroids are classified as a group at high risk of NSAID toxicity, while the aHR of GIB was higher only in anticoagulant users. Antiplatelet agents can give rise to GIB by producing ulcers and erosions, while anticoagulants might precipitate bleeding from pre-existing lesions. Even though the preventive effect of PPI or GPA in GIB is well known among NSAID and aspirin users from a variety of studies, it did not show statistical significance. 18 In fact, among 7977 p"
PMC4691662,PMC4691662_chunk_34,"esions. Even though the preventive effect of PPI or GPA in GIB is well known among NSAID and aspirin users from a variety of studies, it did not show statistical significance. 18 In fact, among 7977 patients who received PPI, a total of 67% were prescribed with at least one of the medications among anticoagulants, aspirin, and corticosteroids. Thus, PPI users eventually became more vulnerable to NSAID toxicity and showed a non-significance in GIB despite the prevention of protopathic bias by adjustment of early symptoms of GIB such as gastritis and epigastric pain.
When there are high risks of CV diseases or GIB, the ACG Guideline recommends prescribing PPI with NSAIDs or choosing COX-2 inhibitors. Since the study population is elderly patients with diabetes who are certainly at high risk of both events, the protective effects of the two treatments were compared. Among NSAID users, the aHR of celecoxib use was 1.09 (95% CI 0.79 to 1.50) while that of PPI + NSAID use was 1.10 (95% CI 0."

Among NSAID users, the aHR of celecoxib use was 1.09 (95% CI 0.79 to 1.50) while that of PPI + NSAID use was 1.10 (95% CI 0.93 to 1.31) (data not shown). In other words, the risks of GIB in celecoxib users and PPI + NSAID users were similar, with overlapping CIs without substantial protective effect. While the CONDOR (celecoxib vs omeprazole and diclofenac in patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis) study found results in celecoxib's favor, the main cause behind this result was anemia, whereas the rates of actual upper GIB did not differ between the two groups of celecoxib and PPI + NSAID. 19 This could explain the similar risk between the two groups in this study since each event was counted from the diagnosis of individuals.

Even though aspirin is known to increase GIB risk by direct injury to the gastrointestinal mucosa, this group did not show a significant GIB risk after adjustment. Furthermore, in a former study, while the baseline risk of GIB in the absence of aspirin was higher among patients with diabetes, the use of aspirin was associated with a greater GIB risk only among individuals without diabetes, 6 and the benefit of aspirin was reported to be similar in patients with and without diabetes in a meta-analysis of primary prevention of CV events. 20 The inter-individual variability in drug response or inadequate thromboxane inhibition by aspirin, known as “resistance,” due to the variable turnover of the thromboxane in platelets could describe this, which may be related to glycemic control in patients with diabetes. 21 22 However, the inhibitory effect of aspirin by other NSAIDs is not likely in this study since recent medication use was detected during the follow-up pe"

In another study, the relative risk of upper GIB in patients taking aspirin was higher when used for primary prevention than for secondary prevention, but this difference was more than compensated for by the lower baseline risk in the primary prevention population. Therefore, since aspirin was used for primary prevention of CV events in this study, the protective effect from GIB of aspirin could have been concealed.
The higher risk of CV events among those with coronary artery disease or heart failure and users of anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, or even aspirin use can be explained by the higher probability of developing myocardial infarction or stroke among these groups. However, even though aspirin is a "
PMC4691662,PMC4691662_chunk_38,"anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, or even aspirin use can be explained by the higher probability of developing myocardial infarction or stroke among these groups. However, even though aspirin is a well-known primary prevention strategy in those with diabetes at increased CV risk, it resulted in a higher risk of CV events. Among 43 758 aspirin users, 83.4% were diagnosed with hypertension, 91% were being prescribed antihypertensive medication, and 53.5% were patients with dyslipidemia, who are inevitably considered to be a high-risk group for CV events, especially when combined with diabetes. Thus, confounding by indication is another explanation. However, SSRI users had an unexpectedly high risk of a CV event, while the well-known GIB risk was not shown. An earlier study reported the beneficial evidence of SSRIs in CV events, 23 whereas another study did so only with long-term use. 24 However, depression itself is regarded as a cause of coronary heart disease by two mechanisms: beha"

When each was compared to celecoxib, nimesulide increased the risk of GIB and ketorolac increased the risk of CV events. Nimesulide is a COX-2 selective NSAID and manifested a coxib-like benefit in another study, 30 but this has not been consistent, showing a higher risk of GIB than other non-selective NSAIDs in another study. 31 It is not approved in the USA and was withdrawn in many countries due to its hepatotoxicity. In 2011, the European Medicines Agency made a recommendation that nimesulide be prescribed in acute pain or dysmenorrhea but not in osteoarthritis. However, it is still on the market in Korea as in a few other countries, and 1.6% of the GIB cohort and 2.2% of the CV cohort received it, which corresponds well with 2% use among orthopedic patients in Korea in another study. 32 Even though it could have been prescribed to patients with a higher risk of GIB, thus resulting in a higher risk in this study, lack of evidence on safety so far and the "

The CV risk of ketorolac, a non-selective NSAID, was marginally higher than that of other NSAIDs in this study, which is similar to the findings of other studies both in cases of myocardial infarction 33 and ischemic stroke, 34 with ORs of 2.02 and 1.90, respectively. Naproxen may be the agent of choice among patients with high CV risk, but only 1.8% among the cohort was found to have received it. Specifically, prescribing NSAIDs only by the COX-2 selectivity determined in vitro by the IC50 ratios of COX-1 and COX-2 should be avoided since COX-2 selectivity is not directly correlated with risky outcomes in real life. 35 This could be explained by the kinetic diversity in the COX inhibition mechanism, wi"
PMC4691662,PMC4691662_chunk_42,"and COX-2 should be avoided since COX-2 selectivity is not directly correlated with risky outcomes in real life. 35 This could be explained by the kinetic diversity in the COX inhibition mechanism, with which IC50 values are not related, and the COX-independent physiochemical properties of NSAIDs. 36 This also means that the current hypothesis of unbalance in thromboxane A2 (TXA2) and prostacyclin (PGI2) as the mechanism of CV risk of coxibs might not be a possible explanation for elderly patients with diabetes. 37
This study has some limitations. First, the claims database does not include diagnostic laboratory findings, a family history, or lifestyle factors such as smoking or obesity. Therefore, the reason for higher risk of CV events in aspirin users cannot be interpreted as the risk of the medication itself, but as an indicator of a high-risk group since these prescribers must have a clinical background for prescription and the drugs were being prescribed for reduction of potentia"

Nevertheless, one study showed that a failure to adjust a few potential confounders did not cause notable bias in an example of coxibs and myocardial infarction. 38 Moreover, it was reported in another study that non-gastrointestinal comorbidity is an independent risk factor for GIB and contributes even more than aspirin or NSAIDs. 39 Thus, we used various relevant comorbidities in generating propensity scores for matching NSAID users to nonusers and adjusting the Cox regression models. Second, we identified outcomes and comorbidities by ICD-10 codes.

However, in order to increase the validity, the codes were used throughout four digits in detecting GIB events, and outcomes such as myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke are regarded as difficult to misdiagnose. Third, NSAIDs including aspirin are frequently obtained over the counter. However, due to the national health insurance system in Korea, patients receive most of their medication including aspirin or NSAIDs through prescriptions from clinicians since that is cheaper than purchasing over-the-counter drugs making it possible to detect the use of aspirin or NSAIDs in the claims data. Therefore, misclassification is unlikely to be significant.
