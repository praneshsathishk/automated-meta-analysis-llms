However, the target group may have varied preferences. In this study, we aimed to evaluate whether men aged 65 to 74 years requested a CT-based cardiovascular screening examination and to assess its impact on outcomes determined by their preferences.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods and findings</title><p>This is a post hoc study of the randomised DANCAVAS trial. All men 65 to 74 years of age residing in specific areas of Denmark were randomised (1:2) to invitation-to-screening (16,736 men, of which 10,471 underwent screening) or usual-care (29,790 men). The examination included among others a non-contrast CT scan (to assess the coronary artery calcium score and aortic aneurysms). Positive findings prompted preventive treatment with atorvastatin, aspirin, and surveillance/surgical evaluation. The usual-care group remained unaware of the trial and the assignments. The user-defined outcome was based on patient preferences and determined through a survey sent in January 2023 to a random sample of 9,095 men from the target group, with a 68.0% response rate (6,182 respondents). Safety outcomes included severe bleeding and mortality within 30 days after cardiovascular surgery. Analyses were performed on an intention-to-screen basis. Prevention of stroke and myocardial infarction was the primary motivation for participating in the screening examination. After a median follow-up of 6.4 years, 1,800 of 16,736 men (10.8%) in the invited-to-screening group and 3,420 of 29,790 (11.5%) in the usual-care group experienced an event (hazard ratio (HR), 0.93 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.88 to 0.98; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.010); number needed to invite at 6 years, 148 (95% CI, 80 to 986)). A total of 324 men (1.9%) in the invited-to-screening group and 491 (1.7%) in the usual-care group had an intracranial bleeding (HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.35; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.029). Additionally, 994 (5.9%) in the invited-to-screening group and 1,722 (5.8%) in the usual-care group experienced severe gastrointestinal bleeding (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.95 to 1.11; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.583). No differences were found in mortality after cardiovascular surgery. The primary limitation of the study is that exclusive enrolment of men aged 65 to 74 renders the findings non-generalisable to women or men of other age groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this comprehensive population-based cardiovascular screening and intervention program, we observed a reduction in the user-defined outcome, stroke and myocardial infarction, but entail a small increased risk of intracranial bleeding.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Trial registration</title><p>ISRCTN Registry number, <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN12157806" ext-link-type="uri">ISRCTN12157806</ext-link>

A systematic review from Cochrane suggests that health checks have little or no effect on ischemic heart disease, stroke, and mortality [<xref rid="pmed.1004403.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The use of imaging to quantify coronary artery calcification (CAC) score is emerging as a new way of identifying patients with increased risk as the images reflect the presence of early disease [<xref rid="pmed.1004403.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The Danish cardiovascular screening (DANCAVAS) trial is, to our knowledge, the first population-based randomised clinical trial including CAC score in risk stratification. Men aged 65 to 74 years were invited to a comprehensive, advanced cardiovascular screening examination, or usual care. The screening did not result in a decrease in all-cause mortality, although a clinically important benefit could not be ruled out [<xref rid="pmed.1004403.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>In primary prevention, it may no longer be sufficient to focus only on all-cause mortality, as morbidity and treatment costs are increasing. In addition, it is noteworthy that preferences to avoid death compared to avoid nonfatal events appears to be highly age dependent. Individuals below 65 years of age weigh avoiding death highest, while individuals above 65 years of age prioritise avoiding myocardial infarction or stroke higher than death [<xref rid="pmed.1004403.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Thus, patient preferences are critical important for well-informed shared decision-making.</p><p>In the DANCAVAS trial, the primary outcome, all-cause mortality, was defined without involvement from the target group. In this study, we aimed to assess the community interest in cardiovascular screening, user preferred outcomes for such screening, and the effects of screening on these outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec009"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec010"><title>Trial design</title><p>This is a post hoc analysis of the DANCAVAS trial.

From September 2014 through September 2017, a computer-based algorithm randomised these men 1:2 to invitation-to-screening (16,736 men, of which 10,471 underwent screening) or usual-care (29,790 men) (<xref rid="pmed.1004403.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). The randomisation procedure was stratified according to geographic area. Immediately after the randomisation, participants in the invited-to-screening group were invited to the screening examination by a digital mail in e-Boks, an online mailbox used by Denmark&#8217;s municipalities and state authorities. By definition, participants in the invitation-to-screening group became aware of the trial-group assignments, while participants in the usual-care group, including their physicians, were not notified about the trial and thus were unaware of the assignment. Treatment in the usual-care group relies on the individual person, but risk assessment, including measurement of blood pressure, lipids, and HgbA1c, at the primary physician is a free and common service.

Thus, based on participation versus non-participation in the invitation-to-screening group, we calculated the probability of participation. This calculation was based on our knowledge of the baseline characteristics of each person in the invitation-to-screening group. Taking selection bias into account, we used the inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) method [<xref rid="pmed.1004403.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The IPTW method used propensity score to balance the baseline patient characteristics, including age, prior diagnoses, cohabiting status, ethnicity, educational level, income, and employment status, in the invitation-to-screening and usual-care groups by weighting each individual in the analysis by the inverse probability of attending screening. The propensity score p(X) is the conditional probability of attending screening given pre-screening characteristics. The IPTW was calculated as 1 for screened individuals, and p(X)/(1-p(X)) for controls, and truncated to the 1st and 99th percentile [<xref rid="pmed.1004403.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].

The user-defined outcome was established based on patient preferences, determined through a survey to the target group. The intervention led to a reduction in the user-defined composite outcome, stroke, and myocardial infarction.</p><p>As DANCAVAS investigators, we defined the primary outcome to be all-cause mortality. However, recognising that the target group may have differing preferences, we conducted a survey to ascertain their preferences. The response rate was 68.0%, with the vast majority expressing a keen interest in the screening examination. Notably, the actual participation rate in the DANCAVAS trial was 62.6%. Therefore, we believe that the interest of the respondents and the underlying reasons are both reliable and relevant. The majority of the target group prioritised prevention of stroke and myocardial infarction, while a smaller proportion prioritising the prevention of heart failure, aortic dissection/rupture, amputation due to peripheral artery disease, and cardiovascular death. As older patients assign importance to avoiding myocardial infarction or stroke over mortality, these preferences were not unexpected [<xref rid="pmed.1004403.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Nevertheless, these results emphasise the need of patient (or user) involvement when defining outcomes in clinical trials. While the survey achieved a high response rate, it should be noted that it did not include arguments for and against cardiovascular screening examination. Thus, the answers may differ if potential benefits and harms were described.</p><p>The user-defined primary outcome, stroke and myocardial infarction, was reduced with 7% in the intention-to-screen analysis. As we offered a complex intervention, we do not know the effects of the individual interventions. However, in the invited-to-screening group use of antiplatelet and lipid-lowering agents were increased and elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repair were more common, while there was no difference in prescription of anticoagulants, antihypertensive, and antidiabetics. Notably, there were no more revascularisations in the invited-to-screening group. The curves separates after 3 years, thus the effect might be due to increased use of lipid-lowering agents in the invited-to-screening group, as the effect of antiplatelet treatment is not presumed to be delayed. While the risk of the composite outcome was reduced, we found an increased risk of intracranial bleedings. Opposed to this, there was no differences in severe gastrointestinal bleedings.</p><p>These findings are in agreement with recent randomised trials. Prescribing aspirin to middle-aged or elderly persons did not reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, but entailed a higher risk of major haemorrhage among the elderly [<xref rid="pmed.1004403.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004403.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, according to US guideline from 2019, aspirin may be considered for primary prevention in patients 40 to 70 years that are at higher risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [<xref rid="pmed.1004403.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], while the European guideline from 2021, state that aspirin may be considered in patients with definitive evidence of coronary artery disease on imaging [<xref rid="pmed.1004403.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Modelling studies from Dallas Heart and Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) suggest that participants with CAC&#8805;100 Hounsfield Units (HU) have favourable risk/benefit ratios for aspirin use [<xref rid="pmed.1004403.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004403.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The Nice guidelines from 2023 discuss these findings, but due to lack of randomised trials, aspirin is not recommended despite CAC&gt;100 [<xref rid="pmed.1004403.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In the DANCAVAS trial, we recommended aspirin, if the CAC score was above the median score for sex and age. As the median CAC score in Danish men aged 65 to 74 years is 161 HU, the vast majority of those recommended aspirin had scores above 100 HU [<xref rid="pmed.1004403.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. According to the findings in our trial, treatment with aspirin, in agreement with the Nice guidelines, may not be indicated solely based on presence of CAC.</p><p>The main analyses were intention-to-screen; however, non-attendance to screening was more than one out of 3 invited, and this may have attenuated the effect. Due to high likelihood of healthy user selection bias, unadjusted comparison of outcomes among those who actually attended the screening and those randomised to usual-care would be highly inappropriate. Instead, we used the IPTW method. With this method, we balanced all available baseline characteristics (including socioeconomic status) in the invited-to-screening and usual-care groups. As expected, the benefits of the screening examination were amplified. However, this attempted per-protocol analysis should be interpreted with caution, as the model to predict attendance evaluated by ROC curve analysis was poor. Causes such as unmatchable better health and higher personal health literacy among attenders may cause better outcomes in the attended-to-screening group and overestimate the benefits seen in the per-protocol analysis.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first population-based, randomised, cardiovascular screening and intervention trial including CAC score in risk stratification. However, there are several limitations. First, when we planned the DANCAVAS trial in 2013, we were unaware of the importance of user involvement. Consequently, the survey, including the user-defined outcome, was not prespecified. It is crucial to note that, by definition, we as investigators did not define the outcome. Additionally, the statistical analysis plan was completed before data collection. Second, a significant limitation is the exclusive inclusion of men in the trial. Nonetheless, we conducted a pilot study involving 1,044 men and 1,016 women aged 65 to 74 years [<xref rid="pmed.1004403.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Notably, in this pilot study, significant screening findings such as a severely increased CAC score and aortic aneurysms were much lower among women. Consequently, we decided to focus on men, as the purpose was to identify those with severe imaging-based cardiovascular conditions likely to benefit from preventive treatments. Third, we only included men aged 65 to 74 years, and they were mainly Caucasian. Thus, restricting external validity and generalisability. Fourth, the participation rate was relatively poor, and this may have deteriorated the intention-to-screen analyses. In this manuscript, we attempt to address this through a per-protocol analysis, but this model also has its flaws, as the model to predict attendance was poor. Also, inclusion of men with prior cardiovascular diseases may have impaired the intention-to-screen analyses. Fifth, since the screening and intervention were multifaceted, we are unable to determine which components were beneficial and which were harmful. Sixth, information about outcomes were retrieved from administrative registries, but we consider it unlikely that misclassification of outcomes was dependent on randomisation status.</p><p>Based on these results, it seems possible that this comprehensive cardiovascular screening and intervention program would reduce the user-defined outcome, stroke and myocardial infarction, but with an increased risk of intracranial bleedings. Thus, this screening and intervention program is not yet matured to implement to prevent cardiovascular diseases. Future cardiovascular screening programs should encompass both sexes and accommodate patient preferences. Additionally, they might consider excluding aspirin from the intervention arm.</p></sec><sec id="sec024" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pmed.1004403.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S1 Supplementary Material</label><caption><p>Fig A.

</p><p>*Please note: If your article is accepted, you may have the opportunity to make the peer review history publicly available. The record will include editor decision letters (with reviews) and your responses to reviewer comments. If eligible, we will contact you to opt in or out.</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Editorial comments:</p><p>1) We really appreciate the premise of your study, and we agree with the reviewers that the &#8220;user-defined&#8221; outcome is innovative. However, we have some concerns regarding the potential for introducing unintended bias given the approach taken to determine the outcome. Please include a copy of the survey that was sent to the participants to complete as supporting information when you re-submit your manuscript. Further, when considering that the primary trial demonstrated a significant reduction in MACE, we have some concerns regarding novelty of the outcome data presented here. </p><p>2) Please be explicit in the title and the abstract that is a post-hoc sub-study/follow-on study of the primary trial. We suggest reporting in-line with CONSORT explicitly stating the sub-study nature and ensuring that the abstract details the main trial items in 2-3 sentences, including the study population, dates, intervention and primary outcome. The majority of the abstract should then describe the complete details of this sub-study. Please complete the CONSORT checklist and ensure that all components of CONSORT are present in the manuscript as well as clearly defined details of this sub-study. When completing the checklist, please use section and paragraph numbers, rather than page numbers as these often change in the event of publication.</p><p>3) We agree with the academic editor (please see below) that there is a lack of clarity regarding how participants were recruited for this sub-study and request that additional details are included. We think that the respondents were an entirely different group of men but please clarify and be explicit in your methods.</p><p>4) You refer to &#8216;prespecified secondary outcomes&#8217; in your methods section including MACE which, as noted above, have already been reported in the primary trial as such we are confused about the use of &#8216;prespecified&#8217; here. Are these the same secondary outcomes as the detailed in the primary trial? Please clarify.</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Comments from the reviewers:</p><p>Reviewer #1: This is a well conducted and well written study and the topic is both interesting and innovative in its use of a "user defined" end-point. The paper is given extra importance that the overall endpoint of the original study was neutral but the screening programme did reduce the combined end-point of MI and stroke, as chosen by the target population. This is very useful data to inform the design of potential future CV screening programmes. The fact that the adverse event of intra-cranial bleeding was also increased gives particular importance to the debate as to whether aspirin should be included in primary prevention programmes - even if screening has documented asymptomatic vascular disease. The authors do discuss this, but perhaps this section could be somewhat expanded given that there is real disagreement in different guidelines around the use of aspirin, although all guidelines concur on the use of statins.</p><p>Reviewer #2: This is an excellent piece of work examining the preferred patient outcome for CV screening and then the effects of screening with CT, ABBP and bloods on this outcome in Danish males. The effects of aspirin are salutary but those of statins seem impressive </p><p>I have very few comments.</p><p>1. The assertion in line 2 that 'cardiovascular diseases remain the most frequent cause of death and is associated with a reduction in disability-adjusted life years.1' needs qualifying. In many parts of the world this is not the case and in some parts of Europe cancer is now more common.Perhaps 'cardiovascular diseases remain the most frequent cause of death in adults living in middle and high income countries'? </p><p>2. At the end of the introduction the last sentence is unclear. 'In this study, we aimed to assess whether the comprehensive DANCAVAS screening is requested and leads to a reduction in a user-defined outcome'. Perhaps ..'aimed to assess the community interest in CV screening, patient preferred outcomes for such screening and the effects of screening on these outcomes. </p><p>3. 'e-Boks' page 8 requires explanation for non Danish readers</p><p>4. 'at the time of postal' should read 'at the time of posting'. </p><p>5. On page 12 Prevention of stroke and myocardial infarction was selected by 4,593 (50.5%) and 4,948 (54.4%), respectively, as the primary motivation for participating in the screening examination' underestimates the popularity of the end points. % Figures for those replying would be equally valuable and give a better insight in to the popularity of the end point. These could easily be added. The views on the preferred end point of those who didnt reply or who were not interested in screening anyway are of limited interest. </p><p>6. The HRs for the outcomes are heavily dependent on the care offered as 'usual care'. Can the authors provide any data on how well or how badly CV risk is addressed in Danish primary care? Are men of this age routinely offered risk assessment using Q-risk or similar Framingham type assessments of risk? What is the ppn of Danish men of this age being treated with cholesterol and BP lowering drugs? The better this 'usual' care, the more difficult it will be to detect the effect of screening...</p><p>7. How were men with existing CVD handled? Were they included in DANCANVAS in which case the effects of the intervention will be diluted. </p><p>Reviewer #3: Alex McConnachie, Statistical Review</p><p>Diederichsen et al present a secondary analysis of the DANCAVAS trial in which men were randomly assigned to receive the offer of a detailed cardiovascular screen or not. This paper is looking at a composite outcome of incident MI or stroke, since these two outcomes were selected as being of most importance to the target population. The choice of primary outcome is a clear strength of this paper, giving primacy to the outcomes that patients themselves are most keen to see prevented. This review considers the use of statistics in the paper.</p><p>Generally, I think these are very good. Main analyses are done on an intention to screen basis; there is a separate per-protocol analysis, though not a naive analysis, but done using inverse probability weighting. Outcomes are compared using Cox regression (with the proportional hazards assumption appropriately checked), and the number needed to invite (NNI) for screening to prevent one event is reported. Various secondary and explanatory outcomes are reported, in addition to the patient-selected primary outcome. I do have a few comments, but these are all quite minor.</p><p>The analyses use Cox models without adjustment, though one could argue that analyses should adjust for geographic region, since this was included as a stratification variable in the randomisation.</p><p>The statistical methods say that both relative and absolute risk estimates are reported, though I did not see anything in the results in terms of absolute risk differences. I think this would help when judging the benefit of screening in relation to the primary outcome, versus the increase in intracranial bleeding. The NNI is related to absolute risk differences, but it is not clear over what time frame these NNI estimates relate to. Note, the methods section talks of the NNI to save one life, even though this paper is reporting mainly non-fatal events as outcomes.</p><p>There is also mention of RMST analysis in the methods section, but again, I saw nothing in the results about this. RMST was to be used if there was evidence of non-PH in the Cox models. Perhaps this never occurred? If so, maybe this does not need to be mentioned in the methods section. I do not recall seeing anything about the PH assumption in the results. Perhaps this could be clarified.</p><p>This IPTW analysis is good to see, though the reference provided (number 10) is for the use of IPTW in observational studies. The only good reference I have found on the use of IPTW in randomised trials is Jo and Stuart (2009) (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1002/sim.3669" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1002/sim.3669</ext-link>), which describes how to estimate the CACE (complier average causal effect), which I think is what is being estimated in this study. They suggest using the odds of compliance (screening) to weight the control group, rather than the inverse probability of not being screened, which I believe is the same as using stabilised weights in standard IPTW, which may be slightly better. Also, in Jo and Stuart (2009), it is clear that non-compliers in the intervention group are excluded from the analysis (given a weight of zero) - that is not explicitly stated in the current paper, though I believe it was done.</p><p>Reviewer #4: Thank you for this very important study, which is part of the larger DANCAVAS study. The manuscript is written in a clear, concise and informative manner. I have no major comments to make, but I just wanted to ask whether your data would allow you to identify or suggest ways to adjust for the slightly increasing risk of intracranial haemorrhage with intensive medical prophylaxis (which is what you have found in this post-hoc analysis)? However, I realise that this is probably beyond the scope of the paper presenting the results of this study, and I congratulate you on your important work.</p><p>Any attachments provided with reviews can be seen via the following link:</p><p>[LINK]</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Comments from the academic editor:</p><p>I am familiar with the DANCAVAS trial. A few comments and questions:</p><p>1. The authors write that the user-defined outcome "was defined as a composite of reasons chosen by more than 50% of the population." Was this prespecified before the survey was done or post-doc? I think this is important to describe to readers because it was already known from DANCAVAS that the composite from stroke/MI/death has a p-value of &lt;0.05. So there could have been an unintentional temptation ("researcher degrees of freedom) to develop a user outcome that was a "significant" result.</p><p>2. I would like more details on sampling of the target group. Were the men sampled using the same eligibility criteria and underlying registry from which the original participants were sampled? What is e-Boks? How do they know the men were not aware of DANCAVAS? What were the characteristics of men invited in the survey and how did those who participated differ from those who did not participate?</p><p>3. In addition to the IPTW analysis, I wonder if a useful complementary method to get at the effect size of screening itself (rather than the invitation to screen) would be to use an instrumental variable approach. Some experts use the phrase "Contamination adjusted intention to treat" for this approach; see the below citation. This isn't a requirement for me for publication, but I do wonder if it would strengthen the paper in giving clinicians an answer to the question that is most directly relevant to them, i.e., what is the effect size and NNT of screening for this patient in front of me.</p><p>Sussman JB, et al. BMJ 2010;340:c2073.</p><p>Cuzick J, et al. Statistics in Medicine 1997;16:1017-29.</p><p>This approach has been used a several important screening/invitation trials recently, for example, the recent colonoscopy trial in NEJM:</p><p>Bretthauer M, et al. N Engl J Med 2022;387:1547-56.</p><p>4. One thing that gives me pause is how the user-centered outcome was chosen.</p><p>The justification and methods feel very slender. There are lots of different consensus and deliberation methods to work with patients; why not choose one of those methods? Why are no other studies cited that build a background texture for this approach (i.e., like a formative paper or something, even an a priori protocol). How did theory guide this? It just feels a bit ad hoc as written currently.</p><p>This user-centered outcome is really the thing that advances science, yet there are minimal details on this. The outcome data has essentially already been published in the NEJM where MI/CVD/death was already reported as a "significant" secondary outcome (p. 7 of the NEJM paper).</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------</p><p>General editorial requests:</p><p>1.

Please see below for further comments which we require that you address in full. </p><p>Many of the requirements pertain to formatting and some may not apply or may have been incorporated adequately already but please check ensure that each item is included as necessary.</p><p>DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT</p><p>Please provide a URL for inquiries to &#8216;Danish Statistics&#8217;.</p><p>STATISTICAL REPORTING</p><p>When reporting p values please report as &lt;0.001 and where higher as p=0.002, for example. Please check and amend throughout all sub-sections of the manuscript and supporting files as relevant.</p><p>ABSTRACT</p><p>Please remove all current subheadings and revise as follows ensuring that your abstract reads as continuous prose. </p><p>Suggest referring to the DANCAVAS trial in the past tense &#8211; &#8216;was&#8217; as opposed to &#8216;is&#8217;.</p><p>Please structure your abstract using the PLOS Medicine headings (Background, Methods and Findings, Conclusions).</p><p>Please combine the Methods and Findings sections into one section, &#8220;Methods and findings&#8221;.</p><p>Abstract Background: Please provide context of why the study is important. The final sentence should clearly state the study question. The &#8216;user-defined&#8217; outcome is a really novel part of this study and it would be worth elaborating a little on exactly what this means, for those less familiar. A reference to &#8216;patient preferences&#8217; as per your introduction might be helpful.</p><p>Page 3 line 3 &#8211; please revise the phrase &#8216;reduce a user-defined outcome&#8217; and be explicit as to what your study investigates, &#8216;&#8230;impacts an outcome determined by patient preferences&#8230;&#8217; perhaps instead.</p><p>Please also replace &#8216;elderly&#8217; with &#8216;older&#8217; or simply state the age range without applying vintage to it.

(example for absolute risks: PMID: 28399126). </p><p>Please include a summary of adverse events if these were assessed in the study.</p><p>In the last sentence of the Abstract Methods and Findings section, please describe the main limitation(s) of the study's methodology.</p><p>Abstract Conclusions:</p><p>Please address the study implications without overreaching what can be concluded from the data; the phrase "In this study, we observed ..." may be useful.</p><p>Please interpret the study based on the results presented in the abstract, emphasizing what is new without overstating your conclusions.</p><p>Please avoid vague statements such as "these results have major implications for policy/clinical care". Mention only specific implications substantiated by the results.</p><p>Please avoid assertions of primacy ("We report for the first time....") which can be risky!</p><p>AUTHOR SUMMARY</p><p>At this stage, we ask that you include a short, non-technical Author Summary of your research to make findings accessible to a wide audience that includes both scientists and non-scientists. The authors summary should consist of 2-3 succinct bullet points under each of the following headings:</p><p>&#8226; Why Was This Study Done?

</p><p>Dear Dr Diederichsen,&#160;</p><p>On behalf of my colleagues and the Academic Editor, Dr. David Flood, I am pleased to inform you that we have agreed to publish your manuscript "User-defined outcomes of the Danish Cardiovascular Screening (DANCAVAS) trial: a post hoc analyses of a population-based, randomised controlled trial" (PMEDICINE-D-24-00161R3) in PLOS Medicine.</p><p>Prior to publication please address the following revisions:</p><p>1) ABSTRACT</p><p>Page 3, line 1 &#8211; please amend to read as follows, &#8216;The Danish cardiovascular screening (DANCAVAS) trial, a nationwide trial designed to investigate the impact of cardiovascular screening in men, did not&#8230;&#8217;</p><p>Page 4, line 3 &#8211; please amend to read as follows &#8216;The primary limitation of the study is that exclusive enrolment&#8230;renders&#8230;&#8217;</p><p>Page 14, line 16 &#8211; please remove &#8216;Tweet&#8217; we have recorded this for you.</p><p>2) AUTHOR SUMMARY</p><p>Please revise as follows for improved grammar and accessibility.</p><p>Why Was This Study Done? </p><p>&#8226; Stroke and heart attack remain a prevalent cause of decreased quality of life and premature death.</p><p>&#8226; Coronary atherosclerosis serves as an important risk modifier and is easily identifiable by cardiac imaging.</p><p>&#8226; Despite this, screening for cardiovascular disease by cardiac CT in the Danish cardiovascular screening (DANCAVAS) trial, did not lead to a decrease in death from cardiovascular causes.</p><p>&#8226; However, it is essential to recognize that patients may have preferences other than death, and these preferences play a critically important role in informed and shared decision-making between caregivers and patients.</p><p>Line 16 &#8211; please replace &#8216;aneurisms&#8217; with &#8216;aneurysms&#8217;.</p><p>Line 17 &#8211; please revise to read as follows, &#8216;Here, the study outcomes were determined&#8230;&#8217; as currently written the text suggests that for the primary trial outcomes were determined by patient preference.</p><p>Line 21 &#8211; suggest, &#8216;intracranial haemorrhage&#8217;.</p><p>What do these findings mean?</p><p>Line 2 &#8211; please replace, &#8216;meet&#8217; with &#8216;met&#8217;.</p><p>Line 3 &#8211; please replace &#8216;brain&#8217; with &#8216;intracranial&#8217;.</p><p>Line 4 &#8211; please revise as follows, &#8216;These data suggest that there is limited benefit to the widespread implementation of cardiovascular screening programmes.&#8217;</p><p>It would be helpful to include an additional point explaining what needs to happen next. Can we improve CV screening programmes? Should we focus on screening differently? Or should we focus on healthy life-style interventions instead? Or a combination of the above? Please be brief but clear.</p><p>3) INTRODUCTION</p><p>Line 3 &#8211; please change &#8216;is&#8217; to &#8216;are&#8217;.</p><p>4) TABLES </p><p>Table 2 &amp; 3 &#8211; incidence risk difference column. To improve reader accessibility it would be helpful to place the 95% CIs below the RD to prevent splitting across rows. </p><p>It seems evident only where you present negative values. You could reduce the size of column 1 to give you more space.</p><p>Please also revise as relevant in the supporting information tables &#8211; for example supplementary table 2.</p><p>5) DISCUSSION </p><p>Page 16, Line 15 &#8211; note the citation in superscript &#8211; please follow referencing guidance detailed below (and throughout).</p><p>Page 17, line 6 &#8211; sentence beginning &#8216;Aspirin&#8230;&#8217; please revise to read as follows, &#8216;Prescribing aspirin to&#8230;&#8217;</p><p>Page 17, line 12 &#8211; please define &#8216;MESA&#8217; apologies if I have missed it.</p><p>Page 17, line 21 &#8211; please replace &#8216;diluted&#8217; with &#8216;attenuated&#8217;.</p><p>Page 18, line 18 &#8211; please replace &#8216;restrict&#8217; with &#8216;Thus restricting external validity and generalisability&#8217;.</p><p>Page 18, line 21 &#8211; it would be helpful to (briefly) define the &#8216;flaws&#8217; you refer to here.</p><p>Page 19, line 3 &#8211; please remove the sub-heading &#8216;Conclusion&#8217;.</p><p>Page 19, line 6 &#8211; as for the author summary above, a point about what could or should be done next to move things forward would be helpful.</p><p>Page 19, line 7 &#8211; please replace &#8216;jet&#8217; with &#8216;yet&#8217;.</p><p>6) REFERENCES</p><p>For in-text reference callouts please place citations in square parentheses separate by commas and preceding punctuation. For example, &#8216;[1,3,6].&#8217; or &#8216;[1-3].&#8217; Please check and amend throughout all sub-sections of the manuscript and supporting files.</p><p>Before your manuscript can be formally accepted you will need to complete some formatting changes, which you will receive in a follow up email.
