Their generation in arterial disease, and their modulation by cardiovascular therapies is unknown. Furthermore, the Lands cycle acyl-transferases that catalyze their formation are unidentified. eoxPL were measured in platelets and leukocytes from an atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) cohort and retrieved human arterial thrombi from three anatomical sites. The impact of age, gender, and aspirin was characterized in platelets from healthy subjects administered low-dose aspirin. The role of lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3 (LPCAT3) in eoxPL biosynthesis was tested using an inhibitor and a cell-free assay. Platelets from ASCVD patients generated lower levels of COX-derived eoxPL but elevated 12-LOX-diacyl forms, than platelets from healthy controls. This associated with aspirin and was recapitulated in healthy subjects by aspirin supplementation. P2Y12 inhibition had no impact on eoxPL. LPCAT3 inhibition selectively prevented 12-LOX-derived diacyl-eoxPL generation. LPCAT3 activity was not directly altered by aspirin. P2Y12 inhibition or aspirin had little impact on eoxPL in leukocytes. Complex aspirin-dependent gender and seasonal effects on platelet eoxPL generation were seen in healthy subjects. Limb or coronary (ST-elevation myocardial infarction, STEMI) thrombi displayed a platelet eoxPL signature while carotid thrombi had a white cell profile. EoxPL are altered in ASCVD by a commonly used cardiovascular therapy, and LPCAT3 was identified as the acyltransferase generating aspirin-sensitive 12-LOX diacyl forms. These changes to the phospholipid composition of blood cells in humans at risk of thrombosis may be clinically significant where the procoagulant membrane plays a central role in driving elevated thrombotic risk.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical" id="abs0015"><title>Graphical abstract</title><fig id="undfig1" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="ga1.jpg"/></fig></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Supplementary key words</title><kwd>lipidomics</kwd><kwd>thrombosis</kwd><kwd>phospholipids</kwd><kwd>acute coronary syndrome</kwd><kwd>platelets</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><def-list><title>Abbreviations</title><def-item><term id="kwrd0040">AAA</term><def><p>abdominal aortic aneurysm</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd0050">ACD</term><def><p>acidified citrate dextrose</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd0060">ACS</term><def><p>acute coronary syndrome</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd0070">ACSL</term><def><p>acyl-CoA synthetase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd0080">ASCVD</term><def><p>atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd0090">CAD</term><def><p>coronary artery disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd0100">COX</term><def><p>cyclooxygenase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd0110">eoxPL</term><def><p>enzymatically oxygenated phospholipid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd0120">HC</term><def><p>healthy controls</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd0130">HETE</term><def><p>hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd0140">IS</term><def><p>internal standards</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd0150">LOQ</term><def><p>limit of quantitation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd0160">LOX</term><def><p>lipoxygenase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd0170">LPLAT</term><def><p>lysophospholipid acyl transferase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd0180">LPCAT3</term><def><p>lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd0190">MRM</term><def><p>multiple reaction monitoring</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd0200">PC</term><def><p>phosphatidylcholine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd0210">PE</term><def><p>phosphatidylethanolamine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd0220">PS</term><def><p>phosphatidylserine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd0221">RF</term><def><p>risk-factor controls with no significant CAD</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd0230">STEMI</term><def><p>ST-elevation myocardial infarction</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd0240">TXA2</term><def><p>thromboxane A2</p></def></def-item></def-list></front><body><p id="p0010">Coagulation factor activity, to form an occlusive thrombus, requires the presence of an electronegative procoagulant membrane, comprising phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). In this model, resting cells maintain PS and PE on the inner plasma membrane leaflet, but on activation (eg thrombin activation of platelets) they externalize up to 7%&#8211;10% via scramblase (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Through associating with calcium and supported by PE, the PS headgroup supports binding and activity of coagulation factors, ultimately enabling formation of thrombin from prothrombin (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). In recent years, a role for &#8220;enzymatically oxidized phospholipids&#8221; (eoxPL), in particular hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) attached to PE or phosphatidylcholine (PC) in coagulation has been shown (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). HETE-PL are acutely generated in ng amounts on platelet or leukocyte activation and a proportion become externalized at the outer membrane (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Mechanistic studies demonstrated that eoxPL act to support PS on the membrane surface through mediating biophysical changes (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Calcium binding is increased and accessibility of the PS headgroup to interact with factors appears to be enhanced, supporting increased thrombin generation (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The role of eoxPL in driving coagulation in&#160;vivo has only been examined in a small number of studies so far. These include venous thrombosis in mouse models and antiphospholipid syndrome in humans (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Mice lacking the lipoxygenase (LOX) enzymes that generate eoxPL (either <italic toggle="yes">Alox15</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">Alox12</italic>) generate smaller venous clots and bleed longer in challenge models (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Recently, a role for the LOX enzymes that generate eoxPL in promoting abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in mice was demonstrated, and eoxPL were detected in human and murine AAA lesions (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p id="p0015">Up to now, the generation and action of eoxPL in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), particularly in human coronary disease, has not been studied, and their role in regulating coagulation in this disease is unknown. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a common manifestation of ASCVD. It leads to ischemic heart disease and is associated with high rates of mortality, recurrent infarction, and other complications (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>; <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://heartuk.org.uk/press/press-kit/key-facts-figures" id="PC_linkNM3HqveoR2">https://heartuk.org.uk/press/press-kit/key-facts-figures</ext-link>). Inflammation is a central feature of ACS, where plaque rupture occurs along with recruitment of platelets (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), leukocytes (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) and tissue factor upregulation (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). During thrombo-inflammation, coagulation leads to an occlusive arterial thrombus (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Despite the use of antiplatelet therapy, rates of stroke, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death remain relatively high during the first year following diagnosis (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). This suggests that there are other factors involved beyond platelets (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). A potential player is the coagulation cascade which causes formation of thrombin (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), driven by procoagulant membranes containing eoxPL.</p><p id="p0020">While it is known that Lands cycle enzymes play a role in generation of eoxPL, to date, the specific acyl-CoA synthetases (ACSLs) and lysophospholipid acyl transferases (LPLATs) involved are so far uncharacterized (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>).

Patients were identified by the collaborating vascular/cardiology teams from their operating patient lists. There were no changes to the standard operating procedure and no additional surgical/interventional steps were carried out. Some procedures were time-critical, and ethical approvals allowed the research team to seek retrospective consent in the 48&#160;h after the procedure. This was in the form of written informed consent which included permission to record participants&#8217; medical history from hospital notes. If consent was declined, stored samples were discarded. Inclusion criteria were &gt;18&#160;years and undergoing vascular surgery or percutaneous transluminal intervention to treat arterial thrombotic disorders, where there was a clinical indication to remove diseased tissue. Exclusion criteria were inability to consent within specified time frame. Thrombi were obtained from patients as follows: (i) Coronary thrombi were collected from patients presenting with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) to the Cardiology Department in Cardiff and Vale University Health Board who underwent emergent percutaneous coronary intervention. Patients were diagnosed on arrival based on electrocardiographic features of ST-segment elevation in more than two leads corresponding to a myocardial muscle territory. Following this, patients were immediately prepared for coronary angioplasty. A thrombus aspiration catheter (Export Advance&#8482;, Medtronic, Ireland) was advanced through the peripheral vascular access (radial artery) to the coronary artery and the thrombus retrieved. This was washed with saline using a cell sieve, transferred to a sterile cryovial and immediately snap-frozen on dry ice prior to transfer to&#160;&#8722;80&#176;C. (ii) carotid thrombi were collected from patients at the Vascular Department at Aneurin Bevan University Health Board identified from routine operating lists, who were undergoing carotid endarterectomy, typically following an ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack with evidence of &gt;50% stenosis of the appropriate internal carotid artery on duplex ultrasonography. (ii) Limb thrombi were taken from patients with acute limb ischemia requiring either embolectomy, thrombectomy, arterial bypass, or amputation. For carotid and limb clots, the clot was retrieved using standard open surgical techniques, placed into cryovials and immediately snap-frozen on dry ice prior to transfer to&#160;&#8722;80&#176;C freezer for storage. <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">supplemental Tables&#160;S2</xref> and <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">S3</xref> show clinical demographics of patients including biochemical and hematological characteristics.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.5"><title>Expression of LPLAT12 (LPCAT3) in CHO-K1 cells</title><p id="p0060">After 48&#160;h of transfection with each empty and FLAG-human LPCAT3 (LPLAT12) complementary DNA in pCXN2 by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), cells from 10-cm dishes were scraped into 1&#160;ml of ice-cold buffer containing 100&#160;mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 300&#160;mM sucrose, and a proteinase inhibitor mixture, Complete (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN), and then sonicated three times on ice for 30&#160;s.

In contrast, in both the RF and CAD groups, a small number were not on aspirin allowing direct comparison within these groups. Although patient numbers in some groups were relatively low, a significant suppressive effect of aspirin on both 11- and 15-HETE-PL generation was clearly observed, while for participants not on aspirin in the HC, RF, and CAD groups, there were no significant differences (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#160;1</xref>G&#8211;J).

Next, the individual isoforms of 12-HETE-PL in the RF&#160;+&#160;CAD groups were measured.

Last, since all female RF and CAD patients were on aspirin, to test the effect of gender, males only were compared. As seen above, aspirin significantly increased platelet generation of diacyl 12-HETE-PL for RF&#160;+&#160;CAD males (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">supplemental Fig.&#160;S4</xref>).

These data indicate that altered platelet eoxPL generation in ASCVD is driven by aspirin. This idea will be further tested in a healthy cohort, later.

Previously, in platelets from three unrelated healthy human donors, we found that &#8764;100 eoxPL were generated acutely on thrombin activation (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Some of these were already structurally characterized eoxPL, but many remain incompletely annotated with only partial structural information, eg specifying the chain length, number of rings/double bonds, and oxygenation (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Taking this further, we expanded the study up to 28 subjects (50:50 male:female), to test the impact on eoxPL generation of (i) aspirin, (ii) gender, and (iii) seasonality. Subjects first provided a baseline blood sample following a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug washout, and the generation of the 48 most abundant eoxPL was measured (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Lipids were putatively assigned as either COX-1 or 12-LOX-derived based on known sources of free oxylipins in platelets, eg 12-HETE (12-LOX), or DiEHEDA (COX-1) (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). We also considered oxylipins containing 20:4;3O as being likely prostaglandins, e.g. PGE<sub>2</sub>, which are known to be generated in eoxPL forms by platelets (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Across the panel, 38 out of 48 lipids were significantly elevated on thrombin activation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#160;3</xref>A). Next, to analyze the impact of aspirin on thrombin stimulation of eoxPL generation, platelets were obtained after 1&#160;week on 75&#160;mg/day aspirin in the same individuals. Most lipids we had proposed to originate from COX-1 were significantly suppressed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#160;3</xref>B, orange markers). This data confirm the enzymatic origin of putative COX-1 derived eoxPL. The 12-HETE-containing eoxPL increased following aspirin supplementation, although this did not reach significance (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#160;3</xref>B, blue markers). When analyzed for gender differences, the median diacyl 12-HETE-PL were consistently elevated in males following aspirin treatment, although this was only significant for PC 18:1_12-HETE (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">supplemental Fig.&#160;S8</xref>B, C). In contrast, aspirin had no discernible effect on diacy-12-HETE-PL generation in females (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">supplemental Fig.&#160;S9</xref>A). This small increase in diacyl-12-HETE-PL in males is similar to that seen in the clinical cohort, further supporting the idea that it relates to aspirin. Unfortunately, plasmalogen forms of 12-HETE-PL were below LOQ for these samples and could not be compared. The small elevations of diacyl-12-HETE-PL could result from either higher generation of free 12-HETE or increased rates of esterification of 12-HETE into lysoPL, by ACSL/LPLAT enzymes (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). To test this, levels of 12-HETE and TXB2 were analyzed in activated samples, however while TXB2 generation was suppressed around 95% by aspirin, there was no elevation in free 12-HETE for either males or females (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#160;3</xref>C, <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">supplemental Fig.&#160;S9</xref>B). This suggests that esterification of 12-HETE to form diacyl, but not plasmalogen-HETE-PL is enhanced by aspirin, supporting our observations in the cardiovascular cohort earlier.<fig id="fig3" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig.&#160;3</label><caption><p>Thrombin stimulates generation of many eoxPL in platelets from healthy subjects, while aspirin supplementation reduces COX-derived eoxPL.

Chiral analysis of carotid clot lipids showed that 12-, 15-, and 5-HETEs were all slightly more prominent as <italic toggle="yes">S</italic> isomer forms (55%&#8211;60%) while both 8- and 11-HETEs were around 50% <italic toggle="yes">S/R</italic>. Coupled with the higher levels of 15-HETE-PL versus 12- or 8-HETE-PL, we suggest that 15-HETE-PL originates from both leukocyte 15-LOX (<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>) and COX (<italic toggle="yes">S/R</italic>), while some of the 5-HETE-PL is from neutrophil 5-LOX (<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#160;6</xref>B). The other HETE-PL, 12-, 8-, and 11- may be nonenzymatically derived. There was notable absence of 12-HETE-PL in carotid clots, suggesting little or no platelet involvement (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#160;6</xref>A). In contrast, STEMI and limb clots were characterized by higher levels of 12-, followed by 15-, and 11-HETE-PL, then lower amounts of 5- and 8-HETE-PL. This indicated a platelet signature, largely dominated by 12-LOX (12-HETE-PL) with some COX-1-derived eoxPL (11-, 15-HETE-PL). As confirmation, limb and STEMI clots contained around 95% 12<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>-HETE (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#160;6</xref>B). In limb clots, 11-HETE was around 75% the <italic toggle="yes">R</italic> isomer, consistent with COX-1, although in STEMI, it was around 50% (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#160;6</xref>B). Subsequently, 8-HETE in limb and STEMI clots was around 75% or 60% <italic toggle="yes">R</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#160;6</xref>B). Although nonenzymatic oxidation would predict 50% S/R for 8-HETE, a similar predominance of the <italic toggle="yes">R</italic> enantiomer in serum from clotted blood was previously shown (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>), and 8<italic toggle="yes">R</italic>-HETE is a known side product of platelet 12-LOX (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). In limb and STEMI clots, 5-HETE-PL were relatively low in comparison to other positional isomers and were around 50%&#8211;60% <italic toggle="yes">S</italic> isomer (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#160;6</xref>B). Thus, they may be primarily nonenzymatic, with a small involvement of neutrophil 5-LOX. Notably, clots contain large amounts of hemoglobin which could directly contribute to nonenzymatic oxidation, either in&#160;vivo or during lipid extraction, despite inclusion of antioxidants and metal chelators.<fig id="fig6" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig.&#160;6</label><caption><p>eoxPL profiles of limb and STEMI clots show a strong platelet signature and carotid clots are more abundant in white cell isoforms. Panel (A): The profile of arterial thrombi eoxPL shows site-specific signatures. Arterial thrombi were extracted, snap-frozen on dry ice, and frozen at&#160;&#8722;80&#176;C from patients undergoing angioplasty for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI, n&#160;=&#160;6), carotid endarterectomy (carotid n&#160;=&#160;8) or peripheral vascular embolectomy (limb n&#160;=&#160;6).

Panel (B): Chiral analysis confirms the platelet signature of limb and STEMI clots based on high S/R ratio of 12-HETE.

The relatively higher abundance of 12- and 15-HETE-PL in STEMI and limb clots, and the contribution of individual lipids can be seen. Next, a principal component analysis was undertaken, to confirm which lipids contributed most strongly to the phenotype of the clot types. This demonstrated separation of the STEMI and limb embolectomy samples in the PC1 direction (responsible for 65% of the variance) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#160;6</xref>D). The loadings plot demonstrates that the HETE-PL lipids most responsible for this separation in PC1 are three containing 12-HETE, namely two diacyl and one plasmalogen (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#160;6</xref>E).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Discussion</title><p id="p0180">How procoagulant membranes of blood cells are altered in cardiovascular disease is poorly understood, along with how they contribute to thrombotic risk, and also their involvement in formation of human clots in situ. Previously, eoxPL were shown to be elevated in blood cells from patients with venous thrombosis, and are procoagulant in&#160;vitro and in&#160;vivo (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). However, up to now, their formation in ASCVD has not been investigated. Herein, using lipidomics, we characterized eoxPL in human ASCVD in blood cells and retrieved clots, as well as in platelets from a healthy cohort. In ASCVD patients, platelet eoxPL generation showed complex changes that primarily were associated with aspirin supplementation, findings which were then confirmed in a healthy cohort. Complex impacts of aspirin on eoxPL generation were uncovered that can be summarized as follows: (i) inhibition of COX-1 derived eoxPL generation, (ii) elevation of Lands cycle-dependent diacyl-12-HETE-PL generation in platelets, via LPCAT3, (iii) abrogation of gender and seasonal impacts on eoxPL generation in healthy volunteers. These data show that aspirin&#8217;s impact on bleeding/thrombosis may move beyond platelet aggregation blockade, into modulation of membrane-dependent coagulation. How eoxPL modulation by aspirin impacts thrombotic risk via coagulation in humans in health and disease warrants further study.</p><p id="p0185">Our study found that LPCAT3 mediates diacyl-12-HETE-PE/PC generation in platelets, providing the first direct evidence of a specific acylation enzyme forming eoxPL. Up to now, the particular Lands cycle enzymes catalyzing oxylipin esterification have remained unknown. The expression and activity of LPCAT3, and other LPAT isoforms in platelets is currently unknown and requires further study. The lack of involvement of LPCAT3 in esterification of 11- or 15-HETEs generated by COX-1 suggests there maybe compartmentalization of 12-HETE-PL biosynthetic enzymes within platelets, specifically phospholipaseA<sub>2</sub>, 12-LOX, ACSL, and LPCAT3. This is further supported by our previous observations that exogenously-added 12-HETE-<italic toggle="yes">d8</italic> is not esterified into eoxPL following acute platelet activation to form 12-HETE-<italic toggle="yes">d8</italic>-PE, in place of endogenously-generated 12-HETE (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Also, the lack of esterification of monohydroxy-oxylipins from longer chain unsaturated PUFA by LPCAT3 is consistent with the known substrate preference of this enzyme for 20:4.</p><p id="p0190">Low-dose aspirin increased platelet generation of diacyl 12-HETE-PL. Although this could be due to increased availability of arachidonate substrate when COX-1 is inhibited (<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>), free 12-HETE generation by platelets was not elevated by aspirin in the healthy cohort, and only eoxPL which we found are formed by LPCAT3 were affected. This indicates that generation of eoxPL is also controlled at the level of esterification, suggesting LPCAT3 is somehow modulated by aspirin indirectly. Further studies are needed to determine the mechanism. In contrast, inhibition of COX-derived eoxPL by aspirin is expected to be due to direct inhibition of the enzyme. No difference in eoxPL generation was seen for the small number of patients on P2Y12 inhibitors. This receptor is the target of ADP activation of platelets, and we previously found that ADP is unable to induce 12-HETE generation by platelets providing a potential explanation for this finding (<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>).</p><p id="p0195">As 12-HETE-PL are the most quantitatively abundant positional isomers of HETE-PL, the overall impact of aspirin appears to result in higher total levels of platelet eoxPL in platelets from patients taking this drug. Importantly, resting platelets contain little or no eoxPL, with these lipids being generated following agonist challenge. This means that, in&#160;vivo, while a patient is otherwise healthy, eoxPL in the circulation should be very low, unless a challenge occurs, eg through trauma, infection, or plaque rupture. Where 12-LOX-derived lipids are elevated by aspirin, they could potentially antagonize the antithrombotic impact of thromboxane A2 (TXA<sub>2</sub>) inhibition, through promoting the procoagulant impact of the platelet membrane. The clinical impact of aspirin has always been considered to be primarily via its antiplatelet effects, not via modulation of coagulation per se. In support, washed platelets from patients on aspirin therapy still mount a procoagulant phenotype in&#160;vitro (<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>, <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>, <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). However, this does not exclude that eoxPL may influence coagulation under the conditions under which they are generated within the complex milieu of a thrombus in&#160;vivo. In line with this, a strong signature of platelet derived eoxPL was seen in retrieved human STEMI and limb clots, although it is not known at what stage of thrombus formation they were generated (eg early or late). Agreeing with the proposed role of these lipids in driving arterial coagulation in&#160;vivo, <italic toggle="yes">Alox15</italic><sup><italic toggle="yes">&#8722;/&#8722;</italic></sup> mice, which lack many eoxPL, generated smaller thrombi in an arterial model of AAAs (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), and higher levels of eoxPL are associated with prothrombotic autoimmunity (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Furthermore, we previously showed that both <italic toggle="yes">Alox15</italic><sup><italic toggle="yes">&#8722;/&#8722;</italic></sup> and <italic toggle="yes">Alox12</italic><sup><italic toggle="yes">&#8722;/&#8722;</italic></sup> mice form smaller venous thrombi in&#160;vivo and have a hemostatic defect that can be corrected using eoxPL administration (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p id="p0200">Leukocyte generation of eoxPL was also modulated in patients with arterial disease, specifically increased neutrophil 5-HETE-PL were detected, combined with moderate reductions in other isoforms. Decreased 11- and 15-HETE-PE could result from inhibition of white cell COX-1 by aspirin; however, due to the small patient numbers a clear effect was not obvious, and also, 15-HETE-PL in leukocytes can also come from eosinophil 15-LOX which is not sensitive to aspirin (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). In white blood cell (WBC) samples, a likely source of 12-HETE-PL is platelet-leukocyte aggregates, since human WBC do not generally express 12-LOX. These are elevated in ASCVD, and aspirin can dampen their formation (<xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,&#160;<xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). Overall, the detailed reasons for WBC eoxPL changing in disease are not clear and require further study.</p><p id="p0205">To test our hypothesis that aspirin regulated eoxPL in ASCVD, we next analyzed samples from a healthy cohort. Here, complex gender and seasonal differences in platelet eoxPL formation were seen. First, platelets from females tended to mount a stronger response to thrombin in relation to eoxPL formation. This finding agrees with numerous previous studies showing that platelets from females aggregate more robustly to several agonists in&#160;vitro (<xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>, <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>, <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>). The rather small gender difference was largely abrogated by aspirin supplementation, suggesting that it may somewhat rely on secondary activation triggered by TXA<sub>2</sub>. A second gender difference was seen for LPCAT3-dependent formation of diacyl 12-HETE-PL, which tended to be elevated in males by aspirin, but not females. This mirrored the significant elevations in males in the clinical cohort and showing a gender-specific effect of aspirin on a subgroup of eoxPL by human platelets. How hormones regulate the procoagulant membrane, specifically via LPCAT3, is currently unknown, despite the well-known gender bias for thrombotic risk in men, which increases in women post menopause. We note that in our clinical cohort, the small number of females would be expected to be post menopausal, while in the health cohort, they were all younger than age 50. Last, the relative expression of LOX, COX, and LPATs in males versus females is unknown.</p><p id="p0210">Unexpectedly, while most eoxPL were relatively stable across the three sampling periods, COX-1 and LOX derived eoxPL steadily increased throughout, peaking in spring. Although only a relatively small increase of 1.5&#8211;3 fold, it was consistently observed for &#8764;15 individual lipid species. The seasonal change for COX-1-derived eoxPL was blunted by aspirin. The basis of this fluctuation is unknown, and we found no reports of seasonal variation in platelet activities in the literature. Unfortunately, a fourth sample per patient was not obtained during the study period and so eoxPL generation could not be followed further. Although samples were in storage for different times, we do not expect this to have selectively led to changes in only some eoxPL versus others as storage time was overall less than a year.</p><p id="p0215">We previously used chiral chromatography to evidence the direct enzymatic involvement of LOX enzymes in generating platelet and Th2 macrophage eoxPL (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Taking this further, here, limb or STEMI clots were characterized by a strong platelet eoxPL signature, while white cell or nonenzymatic eoxPL dominated the composition of carotid thrombi. Although these clots were formed in&#160;vivo under flow, the content of the clot could be influenced by other anatomical/pathological factors. For instance, carotid clot may be contaminated by significant amount of plaque lipid relative to clot. This is due to the nature of the surgical extraction technique which may also explain the lower total amounts of oxPL. Consistent with this, a predominance of 15-HETE-PL was seen in carotid samples which may originate from macrophages/foam cells in plaque lesions (<xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>). Free 15-HETE has previously been reported as a component of human carotid plaques, but was deemed to be nonenzymatically generated (<xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>). Our chiral analysis agrees with this, since it indicated relatively similar proportions of <italic toggle="yes">S</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">R</italic> stereoisomers in carotid plaque. This is consistent with studies examining the enantiomeric composition of hydroxyoctodecadienoic acids within advanced atherosclerotic plaques (<xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>). The physiological age of the analyzed clots may also contribute differences. STEMI clots were retrieved within a short time from formation (&lt;3&#160;h) compared to carotid clots (days/weeks). Thus, the 12<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>-HETE-PL dominant profile in STEMI clots may relate to an acute burst of platelet activation in the first few hours of thrombosis, compared to the carotid clots where time has passed since formation which allows for clot metabolism to take place by the generation of an organized fibrin scaffold, modification to the cellular components and possible PL degradation (<xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>, <xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>, <xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>). This could also contribute to higher observed amounts of HETE-PL seen owing due to a level of inflammatory cell activation in the acute phase (<xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>). Clots collected from limb embolectomies varied in retrieval time (&#8220;age&#8221;), and this may explain the mixed picture observed in the multivariate analysis where despite an overall similar profile to STEMI, at least two of the &#8220;oldest&#8221; clots were behaving in a way closer to carotid clots. Other factors that may explain the variability include interindividual variability, comorbidity profile, medications, or lifestyle choices. However, the current sample size is not sufficiently powered to investigate this in depth.</p><sec id="sec3.1"><title>Study limitations</title><p id="p0220">While cells from patients with ACS demonstrated lipidomic and biological differences, it is not possible to determine causality since it is not possible to predict when an ACS event will occur (<xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>). Furthermore, the use of A23187 (a nonphysiological agonist of leukocytes) was to assess the ability and capacity of WBC to generate more eoxPL on stimulation compared with resting states, and given its nonphysiological nature, it would not be valid to use this to test how differences in HETE-PL on the surface of stimulated WBC affect coagulation in health and disease. Moreover, it is difficult to disentangle the contribution of free 15-HETE and esterified 15-HETE to thrombosis in&#160;vivo given the ability of 12/15-LOX to directly esterify AA-containing PL and the untested potential of LPCAT3 inhibitors to be used in-vivo (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). This will form part of future plans for follow-on studies which could also include creating conditional or megakaryocyte specific knockouts to test the role of LPCAT3. Finally, the cross-sectional design of the clinical cohort and the absence of longitudinal sampling time points (particularly for the acute phase of ACS) may be confounded by interindividual variations which may reduce statistical power. This, alongside the relatively small sample size, and low levels of some lipids makes further validation and replication in a larger cohort desirable.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="p0225">In summary, procoagulant eoxPL generation is altered in platelets and leukocytes from patients with ASCVD, potentially contributing to thrombotic risk. Aspirin is the most widely prescribed drug globally for secondary vascular prevention (<xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>, <xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>), with its primary effect being inhibition of the platelet lipid, thromboxane A2 (TXA<sub>2</sub>) (<xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>). Clinically, aspirin is generally used as an antiplatelet agent in arterial disease, versus anticoagulants like warfarin which predominate clinically in venous thrombosis (<xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>). Here, aspirin but not P2Y12 inhibitors had a complex and selective impact on eoxPL generation in both health and disease, thus its influence on the procoagulant membrane needs to be considered. The identification of LPCAT3 as a regulator of the procoagulant membrane which is influenced by aspirin identifies a potential target which deserves further characterization in relation to thrombotic risk.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="sec5"><title>Data availability</title><p id="p0230">All processed data are available as a supplementary file with the manuscript.
