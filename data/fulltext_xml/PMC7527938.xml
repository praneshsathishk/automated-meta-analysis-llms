The 30-month Kaplan-Meier incidence risk of MACE or MALE, including major amputation, was 22.6% in those with prior amputation (this outcome was observed in 54 patients), 17.6% (n&#8201;=&#8201;15) in those with Fontaine III or IV symptoms, and 11.8% (n&#8201;=&#8201;142) in those with previous peripheral artery revascularization, classifying these features as high-risk limb presentations. The 30-month incidence risk of MACE or MALE, including major amputation, was 14.1% (n&#8201;=&#8201;118) in those with kidney dysfunction, 13.5% (n&#8201;=&#8201;67) in those with heart failure, 13.4% (n&#8201;=&#8201;199) in those with diabetes, and 12.8% (n&#8201;=&#8201;222) in those with polyvascular disease, classifying these features as high-risk comorbidities. Among patients with either high-risk limb presentations or high-risk comorbidities, treatment with rivaroxaban and aspirin compared with aspirin alone was associated with an estimated 4.2% (95% CI, 1.9%-6.2%) absolute risk reduction for MACE or MALE, including major amputation, at 30 months. Although the estimated absolute risk increase of major bleeding was higher with rivaroxaban and aspirin in combination than aspirin alone (2.0% [95% CI, 0.5%-3.9%]) for patients with either high-risk limb presentation or high-risk comorbidity, the estimated absolute risk increase of fatal or critical organ bleeding was low in this high-risk group (0.4% [95% CI, 0.2%-1.8%]), such that the net clinical benefit was estimated to be 3.2% (95% CI, 0.6%-5.3%).</p></sec><sec id="ab-hoi200066-10"><title>Conclusions and Relevance</title><p>Patients with LE-PAD with high-risk limb presentations or high-risk comorbidities had a high incidence of major vascular events.
