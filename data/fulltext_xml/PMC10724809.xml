Service coverage related to cardiovascular health (CVH) risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and smoking is also below the global average; there was no improvement between 2000 and 2019 [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Of the 4 noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) most common among Mongolian adults aged 30-70 years, cardiovascular disease (CVD) accounted for the largest proportion (17.3%) of deaths [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In a cross-sectional study that examined a nationally representative sample of 70,380 people aged 35-75 years in Inner Mongolia, 25% of the study participants were at high-risk for CVD, with more than 10% at risk of developing CVD after 10 years [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, Mongolian adults&#8217; low rates of hypertension control treatment, along with high rates of smoking, sodium intake, and obesity, indicate that CVH is not adequately managed in Mongolian adults [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>There is substantial evidence for the effectiveness of individual lifestyle changes to reduce CVH risk [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]; nevertheless, it is necessary to examine situations such as the structural social determinants of health (SDH) in Mongolia, where essential service coverage is not guaranteed. SDH, such as education and health insurance coverage, can be more important than lifestyle choices in influencing population health and health equity because of their connection to CVD pathogenesis. Chronic psychosocial stress can be induced among individuals who are susceptible to SDH, and this stress can lead to chronic inflammation by activating the sympathetic nervous system linked to altered stress hormone. For example, glucocorticoid receptor resistance due to chronic activation of the sympathetic nervous system blunts the anti-inflammatory response; it could contribute to enabling CVD development and progression. [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Further, the Denmark study showed that a low education level was independently associated with a higher risk of CVD among 1.6 million Danish employees [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In Colombia, people with lower education levels have a higher risk of dying prematurely from CVD, and these education inequalities affect female individuals more than male individuals [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. A prospective cohort study that examined 390,881 Chinese adults aged 18-64 years with a mean follow-up of 10.4 years revealed that having private health insurance coverage was associated with a 21% lower risk of CVD mortality compared to being uninsured [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>However, there are insufficient studies showing the influence of SDH on CVH among Mongolian adults. Thus, the identification of SDH should be the foundation for developing strategies that promote CVH and reduce long-term health inequality [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Research on this topic can provide critical information that can be used for evidence-based planning and decision-making based on priorities regarding CVH equity. As prevalence of CVD risk differed according to sex and age among Mongolian adults [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], the population group characteristics should be considered when confirming the influence of SDH on CVH. Thus, this study aimed to explore the sex and age differences in the independent associations between SDH (educational level and health insurance) and CVH among Mongolian adults.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Data and Study Participants</title><p>Data were obtained from the 2019 Mongolia STEPwise approach to noncommunicable disease risk-factor surveillance (STEPS). The World Health Organization (WHO) initiated STEPS in various countries, recognizing a need for standardized worldwide risk-factor data on NCD risk factors for surveillance systems [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. STEPS was conducted in Mongolia to assess the impact and effect of the integrated national program on &#8220;NCD Prevention and Control&#8221; [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. STEPS is a repeated household survey that is population based and cross-sectional. It uses multistage cluster sampling to extract and investigate a nationally representative sample [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The fourth Mongolia STEPS survey was carried out using 377 sampling clusters selected from 21 provinces and 9 districts of Ulaanbaatar in 2019 [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Of the 6654 people who participated in the 2019 Mongolia STEPS, participants aged younger than 18 years (n=173, 2.6%) and those who had missing data on key variables (n=790, 11.9%) were excluded and 5691 (85.5%) participants were finally included in this secondary data analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical Considerations</title><p>All participants provided written informed consent prior to participating in the 2019 Mongolia STEPS. This study was granted an exemption by the institutional review board (4-2021-1341) of Severance Hospital at Yonsei University College of Medicine, Republic of Korea, which allows secondary analyses without additional consent.</p></sec><sec><title>SDH Factor</title><p>Information about education level, possessing health insurance, and average household earnings in the past year were assessed through face-to-face interviews [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Educational attainment was categorized into 2 groups: &lt;12 years of education and &#8805;12 years of education (reference group). Current health insurance was assessed using the question &#8220;Do you currently have any kind of health insurance or health care coverage?&#8221; [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The average monthly household income was calculated by dividing the average household income in the previous year by 12. Equivalized household income was defined as the average monthly household income divided by the square root of the number of household members [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The study participants were divided into 4 groups according to the quartiles of equivalized household income.</p></sec><sec><title>CVH Factor</title><p>We used the modified Life&#8217;s Simple 7 by the American Heart Association to measure CVH. It addresses 4 health behaviors, including BMI, smoking, physical activity, and diet, and 3 health risk factors, including blood pressure, fasting glucose levels, and total cholesterol [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. A cutoff of 23 kg/m<sup>2</sup> for BMI, which has been validated for the Asian population, was used in this study [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Smoking, physical activity, and diet were assessed through face-to-face interviews using standardized questionnaires [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Salt consumption for diet was used instead of the American Heart Association&#8217;s guidelines [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Blood pressure was measured 3 times for 3-minute intervals. Each measurement was taken on the left arm, with the participants in a seated posture [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The mean of the last 2 measurements was used in the analysis [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Overnight fasting blood samples were collected at a local clinic or health center [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. CVH metrics were scored as poor (0 points), intermediate (1 point), and ideal (2 points). The total CVH scores were calculated as the sum of the scores for each component for a possible range of 0-14 (Table S1 in <xref rid="app1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Multimedia Appendix 1</xref>). Scores of 0-7 were considered as poor, 8-11 as intermediate, and 12-14 as ideal for CVH [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Covariates</title><p>We adjusted for sex, age (18-39, 40-59, and &#8805;60 years), work status (employee, self-employed, or others), area (rural or urban), history of myocardial infarction or stroke (yes or no), use of aspirin (yes or no), and use of statin (yes or no). The history of myocardial infarction or stroke was investigated using the question &#8220;Have you ever had a heart attack or chest pain from heart disease (angina) or a stroke (cerebrovascular accident or incident)?&#8221; The use of aspirin or statin was assessed using the questions &#8220;Are you currently taking aspirin regularly to prevent or treat heart disease?&#8221; and &#8220;Are you currently taking statins (Lovastatin/Simvastatin/Atorvastatin or any other statin) regularly to prevent or treat heart disease?&#8221; respectively. The covariate data were collected by self-reporting.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Descriptive values were calculated for the total participant group as well as the male and female groups, represented as a weighted mean (95% CI) and number (weighted proportion). The differences in variables according to CVH categories in male and female participants were calculated using ANOVA for continuous variables and the chi-square test for categorical variables. Independent associations between SDH (education level and health insurance) and CVH were assessed through multinomial logistic regression analyses between the sexes after adjusting for covariates. Subgroup analyses regarding associations between SDH and CVH according to monthly equivalized household income were conducted among the total participants. This subgroup analysis according to monthly equivalized household income was also performed by sex and age to identify different sex and age associations between SDH and CVH by household income. The period of public education in Mongolia gradually changed from 10 years in 2004 to 12 years in 2013; students who graduated in 2013 were the first to have received 12 years of public education. Therefore, sensitivity analyses were conducted by defining low education level as less than 11 years of education and examining the association between education level and CVH according to monthly equivalized household income. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were calculated using the PROC SURVEYLOGISTIC procedures to apply population weights, and all statistical tests were performed using SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute Inc).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The general characteristics of study participants by sex according to CVH are described in <xref rid="app2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Multimedia Appendix 2</xref>. Of the total 5691 participants, 29.6% (n=1685), 56.4% (n=3208), and 14% (n=798) showed poor, intermediate, and ideal CVH, respectively. The mean CVH score of study participants was 8.80 (SD 2.46). The weighted mean age of study participants was 37.5 (SE 0.26) years, and more than two-thirds (2888/5691, 69.3%) were aged 18-44 years. Approximately half (n=3075, 49.6%) of the participants had less than 12 years of education, and one-fifth (n=888, 19.5%) had no health insurance. In male participants, 41.1% (n=1036), 50.2% (n=1265), and 8.7% (n=220) showed poor, intermediate, and ideal CVH, respectively.

These CVH disparities were more pronounced among female individuals and young adults. This study contributes to establishing policies implementation that reduces the disparity of CVH, the most notable cause of disease burden, by presenting the basis for prioritizing a vulnerable population. For example, health service delivery guidelines should include consideration of the link between SDH and CVD, and training for health care providers should emphasize this. Low levels of education may be associated with low levels of health literacy for CVD prevention and management practices [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Therefore, health care providers should assess the health literacy levels of their target population and provide interventions that take this into account.</p><p>There was a gap in the prevalence of CVD risk factors according to the WHO region or income level; Mongolia is a country with a high prevalence of CVD risk factors <bold>[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</bold>. For example, nonelevated blood pressure, one of the tracer indicators for calculating the universal health coverage service coverage index, was 29, indicating the low coverage of blood pressure management in Mongolia <bold>[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</bold>. Further, the linear trends in cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking, obesity, and elevated blood pressure among Mongolian adults are all projected to be significantly higher than the global target by 2025 <bold>[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</bold>. Thus, there is a need for the adoption and dissemination of cardiovascular risk-factor management guidelines. The WHO-initiated STEPS in 2002 is practical and helpful in monitoring the status of CVH and can identify the achievement rate for each cardiovascular risk factor, thereby aiding the formulation of effective health policies for managing risk factors at a country level <bold>[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</bold>. Establishing a high-vulnerability priority population in population health is essential for ensuring universal health in which no one is excluded.</p><p>The association between education level and CVH is inconsistent in previous studies. A cross-sectional study of 7771 nationally representative participants aged &#8805;25 years in the United States reported that participants with at least a college degree were 4.12 times more likely to have ideal CVH status than participants with less than a high school education <bold>[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</bold>. However, a recent cross-sectional study of 1634 Asian American adults aged &#8805;20 years in the United States revealed that low educational attainment was associated with a low likelihood of having ideal CVH compared to high educational attainment after adjusting for age and sex; however, this association became nonsignificant after additionally adjusting for income category and nativity status <bold>[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</bold>. Further studies are needed to comprehensively understand the relationship between educational attainment and CVH in the contexts of including other SDH, such as income and race, for health equity in populations that are vulnerable to CVH problems.</p><p>Mongolia implemented a social health insurance system in 1994 to maintain equity in access to health care. Consequently, 95.6% of the population has been covered by social health insurance since 2017 <bold>[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</bold>. Despite this high health insurance coverage rate, health expenses are significantly related to poverty in Mongolia, with pronounced consequences in households with patients with NCD <bold>[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</bold>. Our study also showed that the population without health insurance had a higher risk of poor CVH status in the lowest income group than in the higher income groups, which is consistent with the previous study <bold>[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</bold>.</p><p>In this study, the CVH disparities according to SDH were predominant in female individuals and young adults. Mongolia is ranked 69th out of 156 countries in the global gender gap index, and the score of estimated earned income among the subitems measuring this index was 0.67 (0.00=imparity, 1.00=parity) <bold>[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</bold>. Numerous previous studies support the sex differences in cardiovascular risk factors and diseases <bold>[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>-<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]</bold>. Our study revealed that low education level or lack of health insurance contributed more to poor CVH, especially among low-income female individuals. Furthermore, a history of CVD in Mongolians currently appears in relatively young population groups; an increase in CVD at a young age is a remarkable health issue <bold>[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</bold>. Therefore, efforts to promote CVH that consider sex and age, such as interventions for modifying CVH for young adults or creating strategies that target gender equality, might be needed to achieve health equity in Mongolia. In countries with limited universal health coverage such as Mongolia, a strategy of using text messages to target younger populations may be useful in managing hypertension to prevent CVD, as identified in a previous research review [<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>The strength of this study was that, to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to identify the sex and age differences in the association between SDH and CVH according to income among Mongolian adults. Further, we used nationally representative Mongolian data to minimize external validity threats.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>This study has some limitations. First, it is possible that participants who had less than 12 years of education but completed all public education courses were grouped together with those who did not complete public education courses. This can be attributed to the gradual change of public education in Mongolia from 10 years in 2004 to 12 years in 2013. Thus, we performed the sensitivity analysis by dividing the education level based on 11 years and confirmed that the results were similar to our primary results. Second, we measured salt consumption as the diet component of CVH, which is not a guideline in Life&#8217;s Simple 7. Third, there is a possibility of misclassification of self-reported variables. Fourth, we used the most recent fourth survey to determine the latest findings on the association between SDH and CVH. The STEPS Mongolia cross-sectional survey began in 2005 and has been conducted 4 times every 4 to 6 years. Further research is needed to identify trends in CVH following structural SDH in order to prioritize risk factors that have not been improved over time. Fifth, the STEPS data did not provide information on individual residence, limiting our ability to determine the impact of residence on health. Although we found that living in a rural area was associated with lower CVH compared with urban area, we suggest including variables related to residence because even within the same rural area, there may be differences in the environment in which people live (Table S5 in <xref rid="app1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Multimedia Appendix 1</xref>). Lastly, although we adjusted potential cofounders, there might still be a chance of residual confounding we did not control for.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, we confirmed that in Mongolia, where universal health coverage is low, the population group that has low structural socioeconomic levels and health care coverage is more vulnerable to CVH problems. As in other low-income countries, female individuals are more vulnerable to poor CVH than male individuals, suggesting that this vulnerability can only be improved when fundamental problems such as structural health determinants are addressed. Strategies and interventions aimed at reducing the CVH disparity in the Mongolian population should be prioritized for female individuals and young adults (aged 18-44 years) with low socioeconomic status and without health insurance.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>This paper uses data from the Mongolia 2019 STEPwise approach to noncommunicable disease risk-factor surveillance survey, implemented by the Minister of Health, Mongolia, with the support of the World Health Organization.
