Background
</title><p>While coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery is effective in reducing the risk of myocardial infarction and subsequent cardiac events by improving myocardial perfusion, the risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) remains notable.</p></sec><sec id="sec041"><title>
Methods
</title><p>This retrospective observational study evaluated the efficacy of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in preventing sudden cardiac death (SCD) among patients undergoing CABG surgery at a major U.S. cardiac center (2012&#8211;2015). Data was manually extracted from electronic medical records between 23/04/2017 to 30/03/ 2018 and verified for accuracy, with patients categorized into DAPT or aspirin monotherapy groups based on discharge prescriptions.</p></sec><sec id="sec042"><title>
Results
</title><p>Of 2,476 patients followed in this post-CABG study, the analysis included 1,005 patients who received aspirin monotherapy (AMT) and 1,458 patients who received dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). AMT group had a significantly higher incidence of SCD compared to those on DAPT (3.1% vs 0.8%; OR&#8201;=&#8201;3.831, 95% CI: 1.961&#8211;7.519; p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.001). The binary regression model indicated that a higher BMI was associated with an increased risk of SCD (HR&#8201;=&#8201;1.064, 95% CI: 1.012&#8211;1.118, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.014). However, patients prescribed P2Y12 antagonists (HR&#8201;=&#8201;0.285, 95% CI: 0.135&#8211;0.603, p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.001), those with a GFR &gt;&#8201; 60&#8201;ml/min (HR&#8201;=&#8201;0.314, 95% CI: 0.158&#8211;0.624, p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.001), and those with a higher ejection fraction (HR&#8201;=&#8201;0.962, 95% CI: 0.939&#8211;0.986, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.002) were less likely to experience SCD following CABG. A 1&#8201;kg/m2 increase in BMI is associated with a 6.4% increase in the risk of SCD. Morbidly obese patients with BMI &gt;&#8201; 35 were more likely to have experienced SCD than those with BMI &lt; 35 (HR&#8201;= 2.400, 95% CI: 1.204&#8211;4,787; p =&#8201; 0.013). Similarly, patients with EF &gt; 40% had decreased incidence of SCD compared to those with EF &lt; 40% (HR 0.347, 95% CI:0.158&#8211;0.763; p&#8201;= 0.008). Patients on AMT had higher all-cause (OR&#8201;=&#8201;2.136, 95% CI 1.502&#8211;3.038; p&#8201;&lt; 0.001) and CV mortality (OR&#8201;=&#8201;3.731, 95% CI 2.233&#8211;6.235; p&#8201;&lt; 0.001) but had lower incidence of major bleeding (by drop in hemoglobin criteria) (OR&#8201;=&#8201;0.704, 95% CI: 0.595&#8211;0.833; p&#8201;&lt; 0.001) compared to the DAPT group.</p></sec><sec id="sec043"><title>

SCD represents a significant public health concern due to its sudden onset and often unpredictable occurrence, impacting individuals across a wide range of ages and health conditions. The incidence of SCD varies significantly based on factors such as patient demographics, comorbidities, quality of surgical and postoperative care, and duration of follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Current knowledge</title><p>While coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery is effective in reducing the risk of myocardial infarction and subsequent cardiac events by improving myocardial perfusion, the risk of SCD remains notable, with reported rates ranging from less than 1% to over 5% per year [<xref rid="pone.0319292.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0319292.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This persistent risk is likely due to factors such as incomplete or failed revascularization, progression of native vessel disease, and the presence of myocardial scars, which can create a substrate for arrhythmogenic activity. A study analyzing a large database of patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or CABG identified several independent predictors of SCD in patients with chronic heart disease. These predictors included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &#8804;&#8201; 30%, chronic total occlusion of a coronary artery, diabetes requiring insulin therapy, chronic renal disease, and peripheral artery disease [<xref rid="pone.0319292.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Thus, managing cardiovascular (CV) risk factors has remained the focus of preventive strategy for improving clinical outcomes after CABG.</p><p>The CABG Patch Trial further underscored the complexity of SCD prevention by demonstrating that while implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy reduced arrhythmic deaths by 45%, it did not significantly affect non-arrhythmic deaths, resulting in no significant reduction in total mortality, as 71% of the deaths were non-arrhythmic [<xref rid="pone.0319292.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. A nationwide database from Sweden reported that 58% of all deaths following CABG were cardiac in origin, with heart failure being the most common cause (65% within 30 days post-CABG and 36% beyond 30 days), followed by myocardial infarction (56% and 29%, respectively) [<xref rid="pone.0319292.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These two studies suggest failure of revascularization may be a bigger factor in this patient population leading to adverse clinical outcomes than arrhythmogenic substrate from scarring. Evidence has shown that CABG can reduce the incidence of SCD more effectively than PCI, with improved revascularization status and by preventing myocardial ischemia [<xref rid="pone.0319292.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. While patients with persistent low ejection fraction despite optimal GDMT are recommended to have ICD implant [<xref rid="pone.0319292.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]; it is not recommended for patients undergoing CABG as a prophylaxis.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Gap in knowledge</title><p>Complete surgical revascularization through CABG and optimal management of CV risk factors may be the most effective strategy for preventing fatal cardiac events leading to SCD. Therefore, it is vital to optimize medical therapy including antiplatelet therapy to sustain revascularization status after CABG. In recent years more evidence has emerged supporting dual antiplatelet therapy&#8217;s (DAPT) clinical benefits in CABG patients [<xref rid="pone.0319292.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0319292.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. DAPT&#8217;s role in preventing acute graft occlusion, improving graft patency, and thereby maintaining revascularization and reducing the risk of fatal cardiac events could be of vital importance. Although most studies have not specifically evaluated the impact of DAPT on SCD and compared it with aspirin monotherapy, Kulik et al. demonstrated a reduced incidence of SCD in patients treated with ticagrelor compared to those receiving clopidogrel [<xref rid="pone.0319292.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Recent literature suggests that DAPT could be an important and underexplored strategy in preventive medicine especially after surgical revascularization as compared to PCI.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Hypothesis</title><p>In this study, we hypothesize that DAPT could potentially decrease the incidence of ischemic events and fatal myocardial infarction by enhancing graft survival thus lowering the risk of SCD after CABG.

This finding is critical, as it suggests that DAPT may offer substantial protective effects against SCD in the post-CABG setting. The adjusted odds ratio (OR&#8201;=&#8201;3.831) indicates that patients on AMT were nearly four times more likely to experience SCD than those on DAPT, highlighting the potential benefit of DAPT beyond its established role (see <xref rid="pone.0319292.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). While several randomized trials and metanalyses have demonstrated significant survival benefits with the use of DAPT in patients undergoing CABG after ACS [<xref rid="pone.0319292.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0319292.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The benefit of DAPT has not been reported or highlighted as potential treatment to prevent risk of SCD after CABG. Currently most guidelines focus on conventional therapies and general guidelines for managing patients with CAD, such as lifestyle modification, medical management of cardiovascular risk factors. Post-hoc analysis reporting on SCD after CABG showed that the numerically greatest monthly rate of SCD was in the 31- to 90-day time period [<xref rid="pone.0319292.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. For those with depressed left ventricular ejection fraction, defibrillator is not recommended until 90 days after CABG. It is crucial to identify potential treatments that can lower the risk of SCD or any death in general in this time. Perhaps DAPT therapy is one such treatment strategy and merits further research to address this question more definitively. DAPT appears to reduce early mortality within the first 3 months post-CABG by preventing thrombotic graft occlusion, a key mechanism underlying the observed survival benefit and the primary objective of this treatment strategy. The AMT group demonstrated a lower incidence of major bleeding compared to the DAPT group (OR: 0.704, 95% CI: 0.595&#8211;0.833, p &lt; 0.001), indicating a more favorable bleeding profile. However, there was no significant difference in transfusion requirements between the two groups, with rates of 9.9% in the AMT group and 15.6% in the DAPT group (OR: 1.11, 95% CI: 0.85&#8211;1.45, p =&#8201; 0.48). Importantly, no cases of cardiac tamponade or CNS bleeding were reported in either group, though one patient in the DAPT group died due to bleeding complications. These findings highlight the generally acceptable safety profile of DAPT after CABG, despite a slightly higher bleeding risk.</p></sec><sec id="sec022"><title>Binary regression model</title><p>The binary regression model further elucidates factors associated with a reduced risk of SCD, showing that the use of P2Y12 antagonists, better renal function (GFR &gt; 60&#8201;mL/min), higher ejection fraction (EF), and lower body mass index (BMI) are all protective against SCD (<xref rid="pone.0319292.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). While obesity and depressed ejection fraction has been reported as predictors of SCD previously, this study presents some interesting insights relevant to this topic.</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>a)</label><p>
<bold>Obesity:</bold>
</p></list-item></list><p>These findings of our study underscore the strong association between higher BMI and increased risk of SCD in post-CABG patients. Specifically, each 1&#8201;kg/m&#178; increase in BMI was linked to a 6.4% rise in SCD risk, highlighting the incremental effect of excess weight on adverse cardiovascular outcomes (<xref rid="pone.0319292.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). Furthermore, patients categorized as morbidly obese (BMI &gt; 35) were significantly more likely to experience SCD compared to those with a BMI below 35, with a hazard ratio of 2.4 (95% CI: 1.204&#8211;4.787; p =&#8201; 0.013) (<xref rid="pone.0319292.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Although there has been extensive research regarding the contribution of smoking to the pathogenesis of CAD and SCD the contribution of obesity is less understood. Blood volume and cardiac output increase with BMI, and obesity is known to affect diastolic function and to be associated with left ventricular hypertrophy (particularly when BMI is &gt;&#8201;30&#8201;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and a prolonged QT-interval. This association suggests that extreme obesity may intensify underlying cardiovascular risks, likely through mechanisms such as increased inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and heightened arrhythmic potential and place patients at much higher risk of SCD. These findings reinforce the need for targeted interventions to manage obesity in post-CABG patients and align with existing literature on obesity and its association with adverse cardiovascular outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0319292.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0319292.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Our study also contrasts with the obesity paradox theory [<xref rid="pone.0319292.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], which suggests better survival in obese patients with acute cardiovascular decompensation.</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>b)</label><p>
<bold>Ejection fraction:</bold>
</p></list-item></list><p>As previously reported, we observed a significant protective role of higher ejection fraction in reducing the risk of SCD following CABG. Specifically, each unit increase in EF was associated with a 3.8% reduction in SCD risk (HR =&#8201; 0.962, 95% CI: 0.939&#8211;0.986, p =&#8201; 0.002), suggesting that better cardiac function mitigates mortality risk in this patient population (<xref rid="pone.0319292.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). Additionally, patients with an EF above 40% had significantly lower SCD incidence than those with an EF below 40% (HR =&#8201; 0.347, 95% CI: 0.158&#8211;0.763; p =&#8201; 0.008) (<xref rid="pone.0319292.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). This marked reduction underscores that preserved left ventricular function may act as a critical determinant of post-CABG survival. The findings align with existing evidence indicating that reduced EF heightens vulnerability to arrhythmias and other adverse events. Emphasizing ejection fraction as a risk stratifier could enhance clinical decisions regarding post-CABG management, guiding interventions such as medical optimization or monitoring to support improved long-term outcomes. While patients with persistent low ejection fraction despite optimal GDMT are recommended to have ICD implant [<xref rid="pone.0319292.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]; it is not recommended for patients undergoing CABG as a prophylaxis. Perhaps more research and evidence are needed to address these important questions.</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>c)</label><p>
<bold>Chronic kidney disease:</bold>
</p></list-item></list><p>Higher renal function, as indicated by a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) above 60&#8201;ml/min, is associated with a significantly lower risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) following CABG (<xref rid="pone.0319292.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). The binary regression model revealed that patients with GFR &gt;&#8201; 60&#8201;ml/min were approximately 69% less likely to experience SCD compared to those with lower GFR values (HR =&#8201; 0.314, 95% CI: 0.158&#8211;0.624; p &lt; 0.001) (<xref rid="pone.0319292.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). This association highlights the importance of preserved kidney function in improving survival outcomes post-CABG. Impaired renal function is known to exacerbate cardiovascular risk by contributing to chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and dysregulation of electrolytes, which can increase susceptibility to arrhythmias and SCD [<xref rid="pone.0319292.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>d)</label><p>
<bold>P2Y12 antagonist:</bold>

This strong reduction effect is supported by a highly significant p-value (p &lt; 0.001) and a narrow CI (0.135&#8211;0.603), which suggests robust evidence that P2Y12 antagonist use is protective against SCD (<xref rid="pone.0319292.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). Kulik et al. demonstrated a decreased incidence of SCD with ticagrelor compared to clopidogrel, suggesting that the prescription of P2Y12 antagonist after CABG can impact mortality outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0319292.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. As novel P2Y12 inhibitors, such as ticagrelor, continue to yield superior clinical outcomes in managing chronic coronary artery disease, there is a growing expectation of similar benefits in CABG patients [<xref rid="pone.0319292.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0319292.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Our study&#8217;s findings underscore the need for further research to confirm the potential advantages of P2Y12 antagonists specifically within the post-CABG population.</p><p>Among these factors, prescription of P2Y12 antagonists and GFR &gt;&#8201; 60&#8201;ml/min demonstrate the greatest reduction in SCD risk. Higher ejection fraction also contributes to risk reduction, though to a lesser degree, while higher BMI is associated with increased risk. Each factor shows a statistically significant relationship with SCD risk, highlighting their importance in patient management following CABG.</p><p>This study reinforces previous findings that AMT carries a higher risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality than DAPT, with ORs of 2.136 and 3.731, respectively (<xref rid="pone.0319292.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). It highlights the need to explore novel pharmacotherapies and understand their impact on survival, underlying mechanisms, and clinical implications. Current literature and guidelines primarily focus on established medical therapies, with limited attention to newer antiplatelet agents and their role in preventing SCD. While guidelines recommend defibrillator placement in chronic heart disease patients with reduced ejection fraction to prevent SCD, patients who undergo CABG with low ejection fraction must wait 90 days post-surgery to qualify for a defibrillator [<xref rid="pone.0319292.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0319292.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], during which time guideline-directed medical therapy is emphasized to improve cardiac function [<xref rid="pone.0319292.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0319292.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. These patients face risks of fatal arrhythmic events within the first 90 days and SCD from non-arrhythmic mechanisms, thereafter, posing a significant challenge. With novel antiplatelet therapies emerging in post-CABG care [<xref rid="pone.0319292.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0319292.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], pharmacotherapies such as DAPT hold promise as strategies to mitigate SCD risk in CABG patients. Our findings support DAPT&#8217;s potential role in improving graft patency and preventing coronary ischemia that can lead to fatal arrhythmias, particularly in high-risk patients. Given DAPT&#8217;s substantial impact on mortality outcomes, further studies are warranted to refine patient selection and optimize DAPT duration in the post-CABG setting.</p></sec><sec id="sec023"><title>Limitations and future research</title><p>Some of the unwitnessed deaths could have been due to non-cardiac causes and we cannot for certain say that these deaths are cardiac. Judgement was made by chart review, death certificate and in some case by phone interview with family member. The different causes of sudden cardiac death are outlined in <xref rid="pone.0319292.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. This study&#8217;s retrospective design and single-center setting may limit the generalizability of the findings. A notable limitation of the study is the unavailability of lipid profile data, which prevented the analysis of its potential impact on outcomes. Another limitation of this study is that, apart from antiplatelet therapy, which was carefully verified for both type and duration of treatment, most other medications, such as statins and beta blockers, were recorded based on the discharge medication list at the time of surgery. Consequently, there may be cases where patients initially prescribed lower-intensity statins were later switched to high-intensity therapy, or where patients were not prescribed statins or had their statin therapy discontinued due to intolerance. Additionally, observational design, the lack of matching between groups precludes establishing a direct cause-and-effect relationship between DAPT and clinical outcomes such as survival and complete revascularization.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="pone.0319292.t005" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0319292.t005</object-id><label>Table

You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#160;I thank the authors for the quality of the manuscript providing an interesting single-center analysis upon a well-known topic, which&#8217;s characteristics, physiopathology and pharmacology prevention are far from being completely understood.</p><p>The manuscript is written in good English without major grammatical errors.</p><p>No problems emerged in the structure of the manuscript.</p><p>The similarity index is close to 3% with no major limitations for publishing.</p><p>Limitations could be represented by the retrospective form of the study, the single center experience and some possible bias about the correct identification of SCD in AMT group correctly defined and described in the manuscript.</p><p>Other possible limitations can be represented by the absence of groups matching between the AMT and DAPT group.</p><p>The statistical analysis is correctly mad. No specific suggestions to report.</p><p>The results found with statistical analysis support the conclusion made by the colleagues with HR, p values and confidence interval correctly reported and enlightened in the manuscript.</p><p>I&#8217;d suggest magnifying the tables and graphics references in the results part if the manuscript, permitting the reader to rapidly identify the references.</p><p>For these reasons I&#8217;d suggest a minor review before publication.</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#160;The authors performed a retrospective observational study as &#8220;Sudden Cardiac Death After Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery and Role of Antiplatelet Therapy&#8221; including total of 2,476 patients followed in this post-CABG study, the analysis included 1,005 patients who received</p><p>aspirin monotherapy (AMT) and 1,458 patients who received dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). They concluded that DAPT prescription after CABG improves survival and lowers risk of sudden cardiac death.</p><p>The topic is currently interesting and I think this study and article had good clinical value.</p><p>Comments:</p><p>1. This study concluded DAPT presents potential benefits in reducing SCD post-CABG. My main questions are what kinds of SCD reduced by DAPT and the mechanism? In comparison of AMT, the main benefit of DAPT can possibly reduce acute major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE), defined as a composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or repeat revascularization but not death caused by heart failure and arrhythmia. In a previous propensity-matched analysis, DAPT did not confer any advantage in terms of improved survival or freedom from MACCE compared to aspirin monotherapy following isolated CABG(1). In this study, the authors didn&#8217;t demonstrate the difference of Post-CABG acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and myocardial infarction(MI) between AMT and DAPT groups, which are possible main reasons of reducing sudden cardiac death by DAPT and P2Y12 antagonist.</p><p>2. In addition, the level of low density lipoprotein (LDL) and the significant different proportion of statin and AAD administration are also important confounding factors for sudden cardiac death, I suggest listed it and do univariate and multivariate cox regression analysis.</p><p>(1)Reference: Hess NR, Sultan I, Wang Y, Thoma F, Kilic A.

</p><p>Dear Editor and Reviewers,</p><p>We sincerely thank you for your detailed and constructive feedback, which has been invaluable in improving the clarity and rigor of our manuscript. Below, we address each reviewer&#8217;s comments and outline the revisions made. We did not identify any retracted studies among the cited references at this time. However, please let us know if we have inadvertently overlooked any retracted references.</p><p>________________________________________</p><p>Reviewer 1</p><p>Q1:</p><p>I&#8217;d suggest magnifying the tables and graphics references in the results part of the manuscript, permitting the reader to rapidly identify the references.</p><p>Response:</p><p>Thank you for this valuable suggestion. We have revised the manuscript to ensure that references to tables and graphics in the results section are now more prominent and easily identifiable.</p><p>________________________________________</p><p>Reviewer 2</p><p>Q2:</p><p>What kinds of sudden cardiac death (SCD) are reduced by DAPT, and what is the mechanism? In comparison to aspirin monotherapy (AMT), the main benefit of DAPT can possibly reduce acute major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE), defined as a composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or repeat revascularization, but not death caused by heart failure and arrhythmia. In a previous propensity-matched analysis, DAPT did not confer any advantage in terms of improved survival or freedom from MACCE compared to aspirin monotherapy following isolated CABG.</p><p>Response:</p><p>We appreciate the reviewer&#8217;s insightful comments. DAPT appears to reduce early mortality within the first 3 months post-CABG by mitigating thrombotic graft occlusion, a critical mechanism underlying the observed survival benefit. Unlike the referenced study, which relied solely on discharge records and didn&#8217;t ensure compliance, we manually reviewed patient charts and confirmed antiplatelet prescription compliance during follow-ups. Additionally, we employed stricter and clinically relevant exclusion criteria, excluding only deaths within 48 hours post-surgery, whereas the referenced study excluded all in-hospital deaths, potentially underestimating DAPT's benefits. While Hess et al. did not demonstrate significant MACCE benefits, their data showed a trend toward better survival with DAPT. Current ACC/AHA guidelines support DAPT post-CABG in ACS patients, aligning with our findings of improved early postoperative survival. We have clarified this in the revised manuscript. Additionally in our discussion we have provided citations to several studies proving survival benefit of DAPT after CABG including study by Sorenson et al and various other studies (refer to citations 10-14) have shown promising results with DAPT treatments.</p><p>Reference: S&#248;rensen R, Abildstr&#248;m SZ, Hansen PR, Hvelplund A, Andersson C, Charlot M, Fosb&#248;l EL, K&#248;ber L, Madsen JK, Gislason GH, Torp-Pedersen C. Efficacy of post-operative clopidogrel treatment in patients revascularized with coronary artery bypass grafting after myocardial infarction. Journal of the American College of Cardiology. 2011 Mar 8;57(10):1202-9.</p><p>Q3:</p><p>In this study, the authors didn&#8217;t demonstrate the difference in post-CABG acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and myocardial infarction (MI) between the AMT and DAPT groups, which are possible main reasons for reducing SCD by DAPT and P2Y12 antagonists.</p><p>Response:</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that sudden cardiac deaths due to VT/VF or unwitnessed SCD are likely attributable to fatal MI and/or ischemic events. However, in our study, no significant differences were observed between the AMT and DAPT groups in the incidence of non-fatal MI, CVA, or the composite of these events as MACE.</p><p>Q4:</p><p>The level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and the significant proportion of statin and anti-arrhythmic drug (AAD) administration are also important confounding factors for SCD. I suggest listing these and performing univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis.</p><p>Response:</p><p>We conducted multivariate analysis and found that neither statins nor AADs showed significant protective effects warranting inclusion in the final hazard ratios. We focused on clinically meaningful covariates in the analysis. Unfortunately, DAPT appears to reduce early mortality within the first 3 months post-CABG by preventing thrombotic graft occlusion, a key mechanism underlying the observed survival benefit and the primary objective of this treatment strategy</p><p>We have added the following statement to the manuscript:</p><p>&#8220;Common post-CABG medications, including ACE inhibitors/ARBs, beta-blockers, antiarrhythmic drugs (AAD), calcium channel blockers (CCBs), and statins, were not significant predictors of SCD (p=0.380, 0.450, 0.428, 0.337, and 0.185, respectively).&#8221;</p><p>The role of statins in improving overall survival (but not SCD) post-CABG is addressed in a separate article under review.</p><p>Also we have added a statement under limitations, &#8220;Another limitation of this study is that, apart from antiplatelet therapy, which was carefully verified for both type and duration of treatment, most other medications, such as statins and beta blockers, were recorded based on the discharge medication list at the time of surgery. Consequently, there may be cases where patients initially prescribed lower-intensity statins were later switched to high-intensity therapy, or where patients were not prescribed statins or had their statin therapy discontinued due to intolerance.&#8221;</p><p>________________________________________</p><p>Limitations</p><p>Reviewer 1:</p><p>Suggested limitations have been added.</p><p>Response:</p><p>We appreciate the reviewer&#8217;s comments and have incorporated the suggested limitations into the revised manuscript. These include the retrospective nature of the study, single-center experience, and potential bias in correctly identifying SCD in the AMT group. Additionally, the absence of propensity matching between the AMT and DAPT groups has been noted as a limitation.</p><p>________________________________________</p><p>Thank you for your constructive feedback, which has strengthened our manuscript.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Iftikhar Ali Ch, MD</p><p>South Oklahoma Research</p><p>5200 E Interstate 240 Service Road, Oklahoma City, OK 73135</p><p>Tel: 405-628-6000 | Fax Number: 405-628-0000 | E-mail: babar_175@hotmail.com</p><supplementary-material id="pone.0319292.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">PLOS Rebuttal Letter to the Editor and Reviewers.docx</named-content></p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pone.0319292.s001.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="editor-report" id="pone.0319292.r004" specific-use="decision-letter"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0319292.r004</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Lazzeri</surname><given-names initials="C">Chiara</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#169; 2025 Chiara Lazzeri</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2025</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Chiara Lazzeri</copyright-holder><license><ali:license_ref specific-use="textmining" content-type="ccbylicense">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</ali:license_ref><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link>, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" related-article-type="reviewed-article" id="rel-obj004" xml:lang="en" journal-id="PLoS One" journal-id-type="nlm-ta" ext-link-type="pubmed" xlink:href="39999151"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
