This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the efficacy and safety of the combined approach compared with CA alone. We conducted a comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library from inception to January 10, 2025. Studies comparing CA plus LAAC with CA alone were included. Of 1,066 identified articles, 11 studies met the inclusion criteria. The mean follow-up duration ranged up to 24 months, with reported CHA₂DS₂-VASc scores ranging from 2.2 to 4.3 and HAS-BLED scores from 2.0 to 3.7. Meta-analysis showed no significant difference in thromboembolic events between the combined and control groups (RR: 1.42, 95% CI: 1.10-1.83, I² = 0%), and no significant difference in arrhythmia recurrence (RR: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.84-1.24, I² = 28%). However, the combined approach was associated with a significantly higher risk of procedural complications (RR: 1.61, 95% CI: 1.01-2.59, I² = 0%). These findings suggest that adding LAAC to CA does not reduce thromboembolic events or arrhythmia recurrence but may increase the risk of procedural complications.

Its clinical consequences include an increased risk of stroke, systemic embolism, heart failure, and impaired quality of life [2]. The management of AF is multifaceted, encompassing strategies for rate control, rhythm control, and thromboembolic risk reduction [3]. Among these, catheter ablation (CA) has emerged as a cornerstone in rhythm control for patients with symptomatic AF refractory to or intolerant of antiarrhythmic drugs [4,5]. By targeting ectopic foci and modifying atrial substrate, CA aims to restore and maintain sinus rhythm, thereby improving symptoms and cardiac function [6]. However, despite its efficacy, CA alone does not eliminate the thromboembolic risk associated with AF, particularly in patients with a high CHA₂DS₂-VASc score. Simultaneously, percutaneous left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) has gained recognition as a viable alternative for stroke prevention in AF patients who are unsuitable for long-term oral anticoagulation (OAC) [7]. The left atrial appendage (LAA) is the predominant site of thrombus formation in non-valvular AF, and its occlusion has demonstrated efficacy in reducing stroke risk while mitigating bleeding complications associated with OAC [8]. Devices such as the Watchman and Amulet have shown promising results in clinical trials and real-world studies, paving the way for LAAC to be incorporated into clinical practice guidelines [9]. Combining CA and LAAC in a single procedural approach represents an innovative strategy to address both rhythm control and stroke prevention in AF patients, particularly those with high thromboembolic and bleeding risks [10]. The synergistic benefits of this combined approach lie in its potential to achieve arrhythmia suppression through ablation while simultaneously mitigating thromboembolic risk via appendage closure [11]. This dual therapy approach is especially appealing to patients with complex clinical profiles, including those with contraindications to OAC or recurrent AF after initial ablation [12]. However, the integration of CA and LAAC in routine clinical practice raises important questions regarding its efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness compared to standalone strategies [13]. Procedural considerations, such as the timing and sequence of interventions, device selection, and operator expertise, also play a pivotal role in determining outcomes [12]. Moreover, long-term data on stroke prevention, arrhythmia recurrence, and quality of life are essential to substantiate the benefits of this combined approach. This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to comprehensively evaluate the efficacy and safety of CA combined with LAAC in treating AF. By synthesizing data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies, this analysis seeks to provide evidence-based insights into the clinical utility of this novel strategy, guiding clinicians in optimizing management for AF patients with complex therapeutic needs. ReviewMethodology Literature Search  A comprehensive literature search was conducted across multiple electronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library from the inception of databases to 10 January 2025. The search strategy was designed to identify studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of CA combined with LAAC in patients with AF. Keywords and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms related to \"catheter ablation,\" \"left atrial appendage closure,\" \"atrial fibrillation,\" “combination,” \"stroke prevention,\" and \"thromboembolic risk\" were used. No language restrictions were applied. Bibliographies of relevant articles were also screened for additional eligible studies. Study Selection Studies were included if they met the following criteria: RCTs or observational studies evaluating the combined use of CA and LAAC in adult AF patients; reporting outcomes such as death, thromboembolic events, bleeding events, and peri-procedural complications; and providing sufficient data for extraction. Studies focusing solely on CA or LAAC without combining both interventions were excluded. Studies lacking control or comparison groups were also excluded. Additionally, we excluded reviews, case reports, case series, animal studies, and editorials. Two independent reviewers screened titles and abstracts for eligibility, followed by a full-text review for final inclusion. Any disagreement between the two authors was resolved through discussion.Data Extraction Data were extracted independently by two reviewers using a standardized form developed using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corp, Redmond, WA). The form was initially reviewed by two authors before approving it for use. Extracted data included study characteristics (author, year, design, and sample size), patient demographics, and reported outcomes. The outcomes assessed were death, thromboembolic events, bleeding events, and peri-procedural complications. Any discrepancies in data extraction were resolved through discussion or, if necessary, consultation with a third reviewer.Quality Assessment The quality of included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for RCTs and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for observational studies. Assessment criteria included selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, and reporting bias for RCTs, as well as selection of participants, comparability of study groups, and ascertainment of outcomes for observational studies. Studies scoring 7-9 stars were considered to have good quality, those with 4-6 stars had a fair quality, and those scoring ≤3 stars were classified as having a low quality. Quality assessment was performed by two authors. Any disagreements between the two were resolved through discussion.Data Analysis Data were synthesized quantitatively using meta-analytic techniques. Pooled estimates of outcomes were calculated using random-effects models to account for heterogeneity among studies. To compare outcomes between the two groups, the risk ratio (RR) was calculated along with 95% CI. A P-value less than 0.05 was considered significant. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I² statistic, with values >50% indicating substantial heterogeneity. Subgroup analyses were performed based on study design, patient characteristics, and procedural details. Publication bias was evaluated using funnel plots and Egger’s test. All statistical analyses were conducted using Review Manager version 5.4.1 (Cochrane Collaboration, London, England).Results We identified 1,066 articles through online database searching. After removing duplicates, 978 articles were initially screened using their abstract or title based on pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. We removed irrelevant or repetitive records and 28 articles were further screened in details using their full-text. Ultimately, 11 articles met the inclusion criteria and included in the meta-analysis. Figure 1 describes the study selection process. Figure 1PRISMA flowchart of study selectionCharacteristics of Included Studies Table 1 presents the characteristics of all included studies.

[24]323GoodMeta-Analysis of Outcomes Thromboembolic events: We included nine studies in the pooled analysis comparing thromboembolic events between patients in the CA plus LAAC group and those in the ablation-only group. The results, presented in Figure 2, indicate a high risk of thromboembolic events in a combined group compared to the control group (RR: 1.42, 95% CI: 1.10-1.83). Moderate heterogeneity was observed among the study results (I² = 0%). Figure 3 assessed there was evidence of publication bias in the funnel plot analysis, with asymmetrical distribution of studies around RR = 1 as most included studies have null values that are not represented in the funnel plot. A study performed by Uwumiro et al. [20] assessed events only during a stay in the hospital. We performed sensitivity analysis by removing the study and found that there is still no significant difference between the two groups in terms of thromboembolic events (RR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.27 to 2.22, I-Square: 0%). This study carried the majority of weight in the analysis due to the large sample size.Figure 2Comparison of treatment groups on risk of thromboembolic eventsFigure 3Funnel plot showing publication bias (thromboembolic events)Procedural complications: Eight studies were included in the pooled analysis comparing procedural complications between patients in the CA plus LAAC group and the ablation-only group, with results presented in Figure 4. The analysis revealed a significantly higher risk of procedural complications in the CA plus LAAC group compared to the ablation-only group (RR: 1.61, 95% CI: 1.01-2.59). No heterogeneity was observed among the study results (I² = 0%). Figure 5 shows funnel plot analysis, which revealed potential publication bias with asymmetrical distribution of studies around the vertical line at RR = 1. The observed pattern shows clustering of studies on both sides of the null effect line, with smaller studies (higher SE values) predominantly reporting positive effects (RR > 1), suggesting possible selective reporting of findings.Figure 4Comparison of treatment groups on the risk of complicationsFigure 5Funnel plot showing publication bias (procedural complications)RR, risk ratioArrhythmia recurrence: Nine studies were included in the pooled analysis comparing arrhythmia recurrence between patients in the CA plus LAAC group and the ablation-only group, as presented in Figure 6. The analysis showed no significant difference in arrhythmia recurrence between the two groups (RR: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.84-1.24). No significant heterogeneity was observed among the study results (I² = 28%). Figure 7 showed a funnel plot, which demonstrated minimal evidence of publication bias, with studies distributed relatively symmetrically around the vertical reference line at RR = 1. Most studies clustered near the null effect line, with only one outlier showing a negative effect (RR ≈ 0.1), suggesting overall consistency in reported findings regardless of study precision.Figure 6Comparison of treatment group in risk of arrhythmia recurrenceFigure 7Funnel plot showing publication bias (arrhythmia recurrence)Discussion This meta-analysis evaluates the effectiveness of the combined CA and LAAC strategy in patients with AF. The findings revealed no significant difference in arrhythmia recurrence between the two groups, but a higher risk of thromboembolic events and procedural complications was observed in the combined CA plus LAAC group compared to the ablation-only group.Similarly, the meta-analysis by Junarta et al. [10] found no significant differences in the risk of arrhythmia recurrence or stroke/systemic embolism between the two groups. However, their findings on procedural complications differed from ours, as they reported no difference in complication rates. In contrast, a meta-analysis by Wang et al. [25] reported a higher complication rate in the combined group, consistent with our findings. Differences in study populations, operator experience, and procedural protocols may account for these discrepancies. Notably, the recruited patients in these studies were at moderate to high risk for bleeding events, as indicated by their HAS-BLED scores.Our meta-analysis reported that thromboembolic events, including stroke and systemic embolism, were significantly higher in the CA plus LAAC group compared to CA alone. Generally, the stroke risk in patients with AF is significantly greater compared to patients without AF [26]. One crucial step in preventing thrombosis is anticoagulant therapy. However, certain patients are at high risk for stroke yet are not candidates for long-term anticoagulation. According to the 2020 ESC guidelines for the management of AF and the 2019 AHA/ACC/HRS guidelines, LAAC is a class IIb recommendation for such patients [27]. Nevertheless, our analysis suggests that the addition of LAAC may not reduce and may even increase the risk of thromboembolic events compared to CA alone. This finding challenges the presumed protective role of LAAC in patients undergoing ablation, particularly among those eligible for anticoagulation. Importantly, our meta-analysis did not address the discontinuation rates of anticoagulation therapy after the procedure, as none of the included studies reported long-term anticoagulation usage post-procedure. Future studies should investigate whether combining LAAC with CA safely facilitates anticoagulation discontinuation.CA has been widely recommended in multiple guidelines as an effective treatment for AF. Recently, several studies explored combining CA with LAAC [14-24]. In the current meta-analysis, the combined strategy was associated with a higher risk of thromboembolic events, contrasting with previous findings such as the meta-analysis by Wang et al. [25], which found no significant advantage or disadvantage regarding thromboembolic events. Notably, our meta-analysis included two RCTs; one RCT reported no thromboembolic events in either group, while the other did not assess this outcome. Therefore, although our findings raise concerns, they are primarily derived from observational studies and should be interpreted with caution. Larger, high-quality RCTs are urgently needed to fully assess the efficacy of combining CA and LAAC for thromboembolic prevention.A prior meta-analysis reported that LAA isolation could significantly reduce AF recurrence rates [28]. However, our analysis showed no significant difference in arrhythmia recurrence between the combined and ablation-only groups. This discrepancy may be due to the incomplete electrical isolation of the LAA during the LAAC procedure. Evidence from a dual approach combining LAA electrical isolation and CA showed higher freedom from AF at 12 months compared to CA alone (95% vs. 63%, P = 0.036) [16], although the study had limitations, including a small sample size and a non-randomized design. None of the studies in our analysis assessed procedural endpoints such as complete LAA isolation, which could explain the lack of effect on arrhythmia recurrence.The higher complication rates observed in the CA plus LAAC group may be attributed to the combined procedural complexity [29]. Performing both procedures concurrently increases procedural duration and technical demands, which could raise the risk of complications like vascular injury, bleeding, or cardiac perforation [30]. Furthermore, LAAC involves deploying occlusion devices, which themselves carry risks such as device-related thrombus, embolization, or pericardial effusion [31]. The specific LAAC device types (e.g., Watchman vs. Amulet) were not stratified in our analysis. Future studies should explore whether device selection affects complication rates and procedural outcomes.Additionally, procedural complications could be influenced by patient characteristics (e.g., CHA₂DS₂-VASc and HAS-BLED scores) or operator experience. It is plausible that higher-risk patients were selected for the combined procedure, potentially confounding the results. The included studies did not provide subgroup analyses based on procedural volumes or center experience. Outcomes might also improve over time with better operator proficiency and advances in procedural techniques.It is also important to note that our findings are primarily based on non-randomized studies, except for two RCTs with limited reporting on thromboembolic outcomes. Therefore, the observed increased risk of thromboembolic events and procedural complications should be considered hypothesis-generating rather than definitive. Larger, well-designed RCTs with long-term follow-up are urgently needed to refine patient selection criteria and better understand the safety and efficacy of combining CA with LAAC in AF management.Study Limitations The present study has several limitations. First, the number of included studies was limited, and the majority were observational in nature. The absence of RCTs makes it challenging to interpret the findings in a generalized context, as observational studies are more prone to biases and confounding factors like selection bias. Second, variations in the CA techniques and the types of occlusion devices used across the included studies may have introduced heterogeneity and potential bias in the results. Additionally, due to the lack of granular data from individual studies, we were unable to perform subgroup analyses to explore the impact of specific factors, such as patient characteristics, procedural variations, or device types, on the outcomes. Finally, our meta-analysis may be affected by publication bias, as evidenced by the asymmetry in the funnel plots because several studies reported no incident in outcomes potentially due to shorter follow-up duration. These limitations underscore the need for well-designed RCTs and standardized reporting in future research to provide more robust evidence. The findings of this study highlight several important directions for future research. First, the limited number of included studies and the predominance of observational designs emphasize the urgent need for well-designed RCTs to provide more robust evidence on the effectiveness and safety of combined CA and LAAC strategies. Second, the variability in ablation techniques and occlusion devices used across studies suggests the importance of standardizing procedural protocols to minimize heterogeneity and bias. Future studies should also focus on reporting granular data to enable subgroup analyses with longer follow-up duration, which could help identify specific patient populations or procedural factors associated with better outcomes. ConclusionsBased on our meta-analysis of 11 studies including 38,432 participants, the combination of CA and LAAC showed no significant advantage over CA alone in preventing thromboembolic events or reducing arrhythmia recurrence in AF patients. However, the combined approach was associated with a higher risk of procedural complications. These findings suggest that careful patient selection and risk stratification are essential when considering this dual intervention strategy. Given the limitations of current evidence, primarily derived from observational studies, there is an urgent need for well-designed randomized controlled trials to definitively establish the role of combined CA and LAAC in AF management, particularly focusing on long-term outcomes and specific patient populations who might benefit most from this approach."}

In observational studies, cheese consumption has been linked to type 2 diabetes, but it is still unclear whether this relationship is causal. To evaluate this relationship, we performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study.Material and methodsSummary cheese intake statistics were obtained from UK Biobank and publicly available genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for type 2 diabetes from IEU OpenGWAS, FinnGen Biobank, EBI GWAS, and Biobank Japan. The primary method was pooled meta-analysis with the inverse variance weighting method. The sensitivity analyses included MR-Egger regression, weighted median, weighted mode, and leave-one-out. MR estimations of causation were reported as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).ResultsIn the pooled meta-analysis of the fixed and random effect model, the combined ORs for type 2 diabetes were 0.58 (95% CI: 0.50–0.68, p < 0.001) and 0.50 (95% CI: 0.32–0.78, p = 0.003) per standard deviation rise in the levels of cheese intake. Sensitivity analysis revealed no horizontal pleiotropy (all p > 0.05) but heterogeneity (all p < 0.05).ConclusionsWe found that moderate consumption of beneficial cheese may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. These findings suggested that increasing cheese intake appropriate for humans may help prevent and control type 2 diabetes.", "body": "IntroductionType 2 diabetes is a common and increasingly prevalent metabolic illness characterized by an imbalance in blood glucose levels. The incidence and number of persons affected are rapidly growing, with alarming global trends [1, 2]. Type 2 diabetes is also a substantial chronic condition, contributing to a large amount of the disease burden around the world [3]. Individuals diagnosed with type 2 diabetes are at a heightened risk of hospitalization, disability, and death, hence exerting a substantial influence on worldwide public health [4]. Type 2 diabetes is a complicated, heterogeneous, chronic disease, and multi-factor behavioral modification could aid in diabetes prevention [5]. It is widely acknowledged in the academic community that a sedentary lifestyle, high-fat and high-energy dietary habits, and hereditary factors are the three main variables that may raise the risk of type 2 diabetes [6]. Therefore, maintaining a healthy diet and implementing positive changes to dietary habits and behaviors on a daily basis are crucial steps towards preventing the onset of type 2 diabetes [7].Cheese is a byproduct of ancient biotechnological processes and is a popular functional food in many regions of the world [8]. As a result, any biological consequences of cheese consumption could have a considerable impact on public health, and the impacts of cheese consumption on health outcomes are of interest and significance. A new comprehensive review and dose-response meta-analysis revealed an inverse linear relationship between cheese consumption and the risk of type 2 diabetes, with pooled risk ratios of 0.80 (95% CI: 0.63–0.93) for 30 g/day of cheese consumption [9]. Similarly, another meta-analysis found that eating 50 g of cheese daily reduced the incidence of type 2 diabetes by 8% [10]. Furthermore, a meta-analysis discovered a moderate link between cheese consumption and type 2 diabetes [11]. Nonetheless, certain epidemiological or cohort studies have demonstrated that eating cheese was unrelated to type 2 diabetes [12–14]. There are several possible reasons for conflicting results in observational epidemiological studies, such as variations in the study population, sample size, and methodologies for assessing cheese consumption, as well as factors adjusted in statistical models. Furthermore, estimating cheese consumption may be skewed due to bias and reverse causality inherent in traditional epidemiological studies. Because the results of observational research were frequently skewed by confounding factors, a novel Mendelian randomization (MR) method has been widely employed to determine causality. With the advancement of life sciences and statistics, as well as the release and sharing of a significant quantity of publicly available genetic data from large cohorts, two-sample MR studies have grown in popularity in recent years. The earliest gene-dietary behavior mapping research used genetic linkage and candidate gene analysis, but these methods have mostly been replaced by genome-wide association studies (GWAS), which have revealed a number of putative biological loci underlying dietary behaviors [15], and a huge amount of publicly available GWAS data are now available, providing a rich source of prospective instruments and greatly facilitating MR analysis [16]. MR has the advantage of minimizing confounding over traditional observational studies by using genetic variants associated with exposure as instrumental variables to infer the causality of the risk factor with respect to outcome diseases, independent of any potential known or unknown confounding factors [17]. Importantly, the MR method prevents reverse causation bias because the genotype cannot be changed by diseases [17].Therefore, in order to offer some support for diabetes prevention in the future, we carried out a two-sample MR study to investigate the causal association between cheese intake and type 2 diabetes.Material and methodsStudy designA two-sample MR analysis was designed to examine whether cheese intake traits were causally connected to type 2 diabetes. This study was carried out in accordance with the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology Using MR Statement (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34698778/). Before causal inferences could be made based on this MR design, three assumptions needed to be satisfied: (1) after adjusting for confounding variables and cheese consumption characteristics, the selected genetic variant was found to be strongly correlated with cheese consumption; (2) confounding factors were found to be strongly correlated with the selected genetic variant; and (3) type 2 diabetes was not found to be correlated with the selected genetic variant. The relevant hypothetical process for this two-sample MR study is demonstrated in Figure 1. Since the data utilized in this investigation were summary-level data from publicly accessible sources, the original study obtained informed permission and ethical approval. The Guangdong Provincial People’s Hospital Ethics Committee also approved this analysis (KY-Q-2021-244-01).Figure 1Flow chart of the design of the present study. The selected genetic variants (single nucleotide polymorphisms) were strongly associated with cheese intake. The selected genetic variants were strongly associated with confounding factors, but not associated with type 2 diabetesCheese intake assessmentThe UK Biobank provided the summary-level genetic data on cheese intake. The UK Biobank also used food frequency questionnaires tailored to each center or diet histories assessed through in-person interviews or self-administered to estimate habitual food consumption over the preceding year. Five web-based 24-hour recalls (Oxford WebQ) were used to assess food consumption, allowing for seasonal variations.Genetic instrument selectionTo select all single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), three requirements had to be met: a clumping distance greater than 10,000 kb, a genome-wide significance level (p < 5 × 10–8), and a lack of linkage disequilibrium (LD) at a threshold of R2 < 0.001. In the literature on instrumental variables, the relevance assumption was generally supported by an F-statistic value above 10. If an exposure SNP was missing from an outcome dataset, proxy SNPs with a minimum LD R2 value of more than 0.8 and a minor allele frequency (MAF) threshold for matching palindromes greater than 0.3 should be used instead.Data sources for exposure and outcomeAll analyses were conducted on publicly accessible genetic association summary data. The IEU OpenGWAS database (https://gwas.mrcieu.ac.uk/) provided all of the summary-level genetic information for type 2 diabetes and the relevant outcome information related to cheese consumption as exposure. Using a total of 9,851,867 SNPs, summary-level genetic data on cheese consumption was obtained from UK Biobank (451,486 individuals). Type 2 diabetes was the outcome variable for this MR investigation. The keyword utilized in the GWAS database search was type 2 diabetes, and the trait with the greatest sample size was chosen as the enrolled dataset. Finally, summary-level data on type 2 diabetes were derived from four datasets: (1) IEU OpenGWAS database with the trait “ieu-a-24” (149,821 cases, 34,840 cases/control 114,981 cases); (2) FinnGen Biobank with the trait “finn-b-E4_DM2” (215,654 cases, 32,469 cases/control 183,185 cases); (3) EBI GWAS database with a trait of “ebi-a-GCST010118” (433,540 cases, 77,418 cases/control 356,122 cases); (4) BioBank Japan with a trait of “bbj-a-153” (210,865 cases, 40,250 cases/control 170,615 cases). The population from the IEU OpenGWAS database was of mixed ancestry, whereas the populations from FinnGen Biobank and UK Biobank were European, and the populations from the EBI GWAS database and BioBank Japan were both East Asian.

The IVW method is frequently employed in MR research to combine the effect generated from each instrument. We performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate robustness using the MR-Egger regression, weighted median, and weighted mode methods. As a sensitivity analysis, the weighted mode approach was an alternative MR method based on different assumptions about horizontal pleiotropy. In addition to leave-one-out sensitivity analysis, weighted mode approaches were used. The IVW and MR-Egger methods were used to assess heterogeneity. MR-Egger regression accounted for horizontal pleiotropic effects and yielded unbiased causal effect estimates, despite the fact that the estimates were frequently underpowered. The IVW method was used to quantify the main impacts of cheese consumption on type 2 diabetes outcomes in a dispersed setting. The IVW method is widely used in MR research to integrate the influence of each instrument. To assess robustness, we ran sensitivity analyses with the MR-Egger regression, weighted median, and weighted mode methods. As a sensitivity study, the weighted mode method was used as an alternative MR method with varied horizontal pleiotropy assumptions. In addition to leave-one-out sensitivity analysis, the weighted mode method was utilized. The IVW and MR-Egger methods were used to determine heterogeneity. MR-Egger regression controlled for horizontal pleiotropic effects and produced unbiased causal effect estimates, despite the fact that the estimates were often underpowered. To test for heterogeneity, the Cochrane Q statistic was used, and horizontal pleiotropy was discovered using the MR-Egger regression technique. Instrumental variables (IVs) with horizontal pleiotropy showed a nonzero and statistically significant MR-Egger intercept (p < 0.05). Scatter plots, forest plots, and funnel plots were used to visualize the data. The effect of each SNP was proven with forest plots. In the forest plots, MR-Egger analysis was also shown. To examine how each instrument affected the overall effect, a leave-one-out analysis was used. The MR estimations of causality between cheese consumption and type 2 diabetes risk were expressed as odds ratios (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Furthermore, because the MR outcomes were derived from independent datasets, they were pooled and meta-analyzed using fixed and random effect models to give an overall causal estimate, with heterogeneity examined. The MR analysis was conducted using R software (version 4.0.3, http://www.r-project.org) and the R package TwoSampleMR version 0.5.5 (https://mrcieu.github.io/TwoSampleMR/).ResultsMR estimatesIn the IEU OpenGWAS database, we found 14 independent significant SNPs strongly associated with type 2 diabetes in individuals of mixed ancestry, 61 SNPs of European ancestry in the FinnGen Biobank, 52 SNPs of East Asian ancestry in the EBI GWAS database, and 48 SNPs of East Asian ancestry in BioBank Japan (Table II). Higher levels of cheese consumption were associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, according to the two-sample MR conducted with the IEU OpenGWAS database, FinnGen Biobank, EBI GWAS database, and BioBank Japan. The causal estimate from the IEU OpenGWAS database showed about a 78% decrease in odds of type 2 diabetes per standard deviation (SD) higher cheese intake (OR = 0.22; 95% CI: 0.12–0.41; p = 1.291E-6) according to the IVW method. Similar causal estimates were also found in FinnGen Biobank (OR = 0.48; 95% CI: 0.35–0.67; p = 1.486E-5), EBI GWAS database (OR = 0.67; 95% CI: 0.52–0.86; p = 1.989E-3) and BioBank Japan (OR = 0.69; 95% CI: 0.53–0.91; p = 9.103E-3) based on the IVW method (Table II). The result of the MR-Egger approach was 0.35 (95% CI: 0.02–7.47; p = 0.516), 1.25 (95% CI: 0.32–4.97; p = 0.747), 1.09 (95% CI: 0.40–2.93; p = 0.870) and 1.37 (95% CI: 0.48–3.93; p = 0.561) in the IEU OpenGWAS database, FinnGen Biobank, EBI GWAS database and BioBank Japan, respectively. In the four data sets mentioned above, the weighted median and weighted mode techniques yielded results in the same direction as the IVW method, despite some of the results not being statistically significant (Table II). Furthermore, a meta-analysis using fixed-effect IVW models revealed that for type 2 diabetes, the combined odds ratios were 0.58 (95% CI: 0.50–0.68; p < 0.001) and 0.50 (95% CI: 0.32–0.78; p = 0.003) in fixed and random effect models, respectively (Figure 2).Table IIMendelian randomization for the association of cheese intake with type 2 diabetesTraitDatabaseNumber of instrumentsMethodOR95% CIP-valueHeterogeneityPleiotropyQ statisticP-valueInterceptP-valueType 2 diabetesIEU OpenGWAS database14MR-Egger0.350.02–7.470.51623.110.027–7.8E-30.76314Weighted median0.200.09–0.411.388E-514Inverse variance weighted0.220.12–0.411.291E-623.30.03814Weighted mode0.160.05–0.580.016Type 2 diabetesFinnGen Biobank61MR-Egger1.250.32–4.970.747176.61.17E-13–0.0160.16861Weighted median0.620.45–0.852.863E-361Inverse variance weighted0.480.35–0.671.486E-5182.42.81E-1461Weighted mode0.850.5–1.430.543Type 2 diabetesEBI GWAS database52MR-Egger1.090.40–2.930.870151.14.32E-12–0.00850.32452Weighted median0.800.60–1.070.13952Inverse variance weighted0.670.52–0.861.989E-3154.12.73E-1252Weighted mode1.060.56–2.000.859Type 2 diabetesBioBank Japan48MR-Egger1.370.48–3.930.561104.91.729E-6–0.0120.19548Weighted median0.700.5–0.950.02048Inverse variance weighted0.690.53–0.919.103E-3108.88.31E-0748Weighted mode0.590.32–1.060.084CI – confidence interval, OR – odds ratio.Figure 2Forest plot showing the association of cheese intake with type 2 diabetes.

Figure 3 presents the findings for all three ways. MR-Egger regression revealed that genetic pleiotropy did not skew or interfere with MR results, and there were no main effect IVs (intercepts were –7.8E-3, –0.016, –0.0085, and –0.012, respectively; all p > 0.05). Figure 4 presents the MR-Egger visualization results in the form of a scatter plot. The MR-Egger and IVW algorithms identified heterogeneity in all four data sets (all p < 0.05) (Table II). Additionally, the two-sample MR results were accurate, and the leave-one-out analysis for each IV demonstrated that all IV calculations indicated that these causal linkages were significant, suggesting that there was no dominant IV for cheese intake and type 2 diabetes (Figure 5).Figure 3Scatter plot to visualize the causal effect of cheese intake on type 2 diabetes risk using four Mendelian randomization (MR) methods.

Although there was significant heterogeneity, it had no effect on the IVW results, indicating that our conclusion was valid.Our results were in line with earlier observational studies that suggested an adverse relationship between type 2 diabetes and cheese consumption. Two meta-analyses have been conducted to synthesize previous cohort studies [9, 10]. A meta-analysis of eight cohort studies, totaling 17,620 cases among 242,960 people, revealed a non-heterogeneous relationship between cheese consumption and a lower risk of type 2 diabetes [10]. Another meta-analysis that included seven cohort studies with a total sample size of 178,429 participants (14,810 cases) found that cheese consumption was inversely related to the occurrence of type 2 diabetes [9]. In addition, Celia [11] found a moderate correlation between the onset of type 2 diabetes and cheese consumption in a meta-analysis. Several earlier cohort studies, however, have discovered inconsistencies between the results of this two-sample MR study [12–14], which could be attributed to the fact that the previous observational studies were influenced by unexplained confounding factors.Additionally, this study revealed substantial heterogeneity but no horizontal pleiotropy in SNPs, which could be attributed to the study populations being from different ancestors including Asian, mixed or European populations. However, whether Asian, mixed, or European populations, most sensitivity methods and pooled meta-analyses pointed in the same direction as the IVW. These analytical methodologies, such as MR analysis, leave-one-out sensitivity analysis, random and fixed effect models, and random and fixed effect models, guaranteed the dependability of the results in various populations [17], demonstrating that consuming cheese was advantageous in reducing diabetes and could be promoted in various demographics and countries, but additional research is needed to understand the underlying pathophysiology of diabetes connected with cheese consumption.The protective effect of cheese consumption against the risk of type 2 diabetes may be attributed to multiple mechanisms. Firstly, cheese is a fermented dairy product rich in fatty acids and trans fats. Previous studies have linked trans fats to a lower incidence of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes [18, 19]. Secondly, consuming certain foods, particularly dairy foods such as cheese, may reduce inflammatory risks, and systemic chronic inflammation may be a contributory cause of diabetes [20]. Thirdly, cheese contains less fat, which could be associated with a lower risk of diabetes. A prior comprehensive assessment discovered that eating three servings of dairy per day, particularly cheese, was associated with a decreased risk of type 2 diabetes [21]. Fourth, one study showed that higher total dairy consumption was associated with lower total mortality and cerebrovascular mortality among American adults, which we hypothesized may be due in part to the role of dairy in diabetes [22]. Furthermore, cheese, a frequent probiotic item, naturally includes living bacteria that play a vital function in controlling intestinal flora balance [23]. It has been found that dysbiosis of the gut microbiome contributes to the rapid evolution of insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes, and diabetes has been related to insulin resistance and dysbiosis of the gut microbiome, which affected intestinal barrier function and host metabolic pathways [24, 25]. Finally, the protein, calcium, vitamin D, and fatty acids found in cheese were among the main nutritious ingredients in the diets of many people, and cheese has long been considered to provide good nutrition [26, 27]. Vitamin D deficiency has been connected with type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, and reduced insulin release in both experimental and epidemiological studies [28, 29]. Modulating insulin resistance and/or pancreatic β-cell activity may be related to vitamin D’s role in the pathogenic process of type 2 diabetes [30]. Although cheese eating was beneficial in the prevention of diabetes, more research was required to understand the likely association between cheese consumption and the risk of type 2 diabetes, as well as the underlying processes.There were some strengths in this study. On the one hand, this study used the MR approach to minimize the confounding variables that are typical of epidemiological studies or are still unknown. On the other hand, this study performed a two-sample MR analysis to examine the perspective of etiology and causal connection using the biggest sample of cheese intake GWAS databases currently available as well as four type 2 diabetes GWAS databases. A larger sample size and several sensitivity analysis approaches guaranteed that the final causal effect value was more certain. Furthermore, the diverse ancestry, which included European, East Asian, and mixed ethnic individuals, confirmed the results’ generalizability. We performed a meta-analysis of MR relationships from the four datasets to improve the power and discovered a consistent combined association. Finally, because the exposure variables and research results were from different databases, there were no individuals whose samples overlapped.Of course, there were significant limitations to this study. Firstly, the people included in this study had no additional ancestors, such as Africans. Secondly, although the sensitivity analysis largely agreed with the IVW results, there was some variation in this investigation. This could be because the study population came from distinct forebears, and earlier research has demonstrated that different genetic variations could occur in different ancestral sources [31]. We would be able to acquire a better grasp of genetic architecture in all populations by boosting variety among research participants [32]. Thirdly, the study was unable to explore the variations in the causal effects of cheese consumption on diabetes among different subgroups, such as gender, because the current analysis was based on summary-level data and lacked personal data. Fourthly, the lack of individual data made it difficult to analyze the linear or nonlinear dosage relationship and could not be used to provide recommendations for the daily amount of cheese consumption. Furthermore, it was difficult to validate genetic polymorphisms, and even using the MR-Egger approach, misclassification could not be completely avoided. Fifth, as the data come from public aggregated genetic data, this study cannot well define “cheese”, and because the nutritional composition and sources of cheese may vary greatly (e.g., from low-fat to high-fat, or from animal milk to plant-based cheese), the current scientific view is that not all types of cheese are suitable for frequent consumption by type 2 diabetes patients. Therefore, more detailed research is needed to generalize the findings, as it is likely that the link is due to something in cheese that raises blood lipids and atherosclerosis, which can lead to an increased risk of diabetes. Finally, cheeses are especially high in saturated fatty acids, so (also taking into account other cheese components) the results might be considered unexpected, and more research is needed for confirmation.In conclusion, our data suggested that there may be an association between cheese and type 2 diabetes, and appropriate beneficial cheese intake may help prevent and control diabetes. However, it is necessary to carefully evaluate which types of cheese are suitable, and more research is needed to investigate the role of cheese components in diabetes. Assessing the person’s typical cheese consumption is the first step in creating a dietary plan. If a person is willing to modify their dairy intake, it might be helpful to offer guidance on how to include cheese in other healthy diet adjustments, particularly if they are at risk of type 2 diabetes. Nonetheless, additional experimental studies must be carried out in the future to investigate the underlying mechanisms of these connections."}

Abnormal metabolism not only serves as a risk factor for hypertension but also acts as a driving force in its aggravation.

We used genome-wide association studies instrumental variables for Mendelian randomization association analysis integrating the diagnosis results of PH in 3 populations from East Asia, the Middle East, and Africa with serum metabolites and metabolite ratios. This allowed us to identify predictive metabolites and metabolic pathways for diagnosing or treating PH. Inverse-variance weighting was the main model for establishing causal associations. In addition horizontal pleiotropy test, linkage disequilibrium test, and sensitivity analysis were employed to test the explanatory power of instrumental variables. A total of 10,922 cases of PH and 8299 cases of metabolomics detection cohorts were included in the study. In East Asian, Middle Eastern, and African populations, we found 36, 57, and 40 known metabolites respectively strongly associated with PH (P < .05). Cross-section and meta-analysis of these strongly correlated metabolites across the 3 ethnic groups revealed 7 common metabolites. Notably, elevated isoleucine (odds ratio = 0.74, 95% confidence interval: 0.56–0.96) was demonstrated as a potential protective factor against PH across 3 ethnic groups. The metabolites associated with PH have certain polymorphisms in different populations. Isoleucine may be a promising biomarker for PH diagnosis or treatment, but more clinical validation is needed.", "body": "1. IntroductionPrimary hypertension (PH) is one of the most important risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, stroke, chronic kidney disease as well as dementia.[1] The prevalence of elevated blood pressure has declined substantially in Western high-income regions since 1970s, but keeps rising in East, South and Southeast Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and Oceania.[1] Asian characteristics differed from the West and led to higher stroke incidence.[2] Masked hypertension is a significant clinical entity of target organ damage and cardiovascular disease.[3] The prevalence of masked hypertension for Asians (16.0%) is higher than European (9%).[4] Regarding Africa, hypertension is common in sub-Saharan Africa, the prevalence significantly varies in different African countries, ranging from 37% to 75%.[5] Approximately one-tenth of adolescents have elevated blood pressure across sub-Saharan Africa.[6] The prevalence of hypertension was high in both rural (27.4%) and urban areas (33.9%) of West Africa.[7] However, the rates of hypertension diagnosis, treatment, and control are markedly low[8] and cause a heavy health and economic burden in both Asia and Africa.[9] The hypertension treatment rates were below 25% for women and less than 20% for men in South Asia and some sub-Saharan African countries. Control rates were lower than 10% in these countries and for men in some countries of North Africa and Central Asia.[10]PH has been regarded as a disorder of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) in tradition.[11] Yet, current treatments aiming at limiting the effects of renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system or SNS on blood pressure fail in about 40% of cases.[12] This implied that other mechanisms may exist. Previous studies found that immune mechanisms can contribute to the development of hypertension.[13] Flavonoids were reported to possess an underlying mechanism to regulate antihypertensive effects.[14] Genetics can drive the occurrence of hypertension in certain patients.[15] Anxiety diagnosis was also reported can cause development or incidence of hypertension, which might be due to the longer exposure to alterations in autonomic mechanisms.[16] In addition, hypertension has been reported to be associated with impaired metabolic homeostasis and can be considered as a metabolic disorder.[17]To date, there have been limited cohort-based causal studies examining the relationship between metabolites and PH,[18–22] with a particular lack of research on Asian and African populations. If differentially abundant metabolites are risk factors or protective factors for PH, it is meaningful for the prediction of the disease and auxiliary diagnosis based on specific targets, as well as for further treatment.Therefore, our study aims to investigate the causal relationship between metabolism and PH in Asian and African populations using Mendelian randomization (MR). We analyzed serum metabolites and metabolite ratios from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Applying MR analysis, which mimics the design of randomized-controlled trials (RCTs), we explored the causal effects of these metabolites on PH. We used metabolite-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as instrumental variables to assess the causal impact and to elucidate the underlying metabolic pathways.2. Materials and methods2.1. Study designThe dataset that contains all the data in this study is available to the public on the open website (http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/gwas/summary_statistics/GCST90199001-GCST90200000 and https://gwas.mrcieu.ac.uk/). The GWAS summary statistics have already been published. The ethics committee at each institutional review board authorized all participants’ written informed permission in separate cohort studies. No extra ethical approval or informed consent was required in this study.In the current study, we comprehensively evaluated the relationship between 1091 serum metabolites, 309 metabolite ratios, and PH datasets from East Asian, Middle East, and African populations one by one rigorously based on the MR design. A scientific MR study must include the testing of the following 3 hypotheses: genetic instrumental variables (SNPs) are strongly associated with the serum metabolites level or ratio; genetic instrumental variables should be irrelevant to the PH and independent of any known or unknown confounding factors; and the effect of instrumental variables on the results is mediated only by the serum metabolites level or ratio. Briefly, a causal analysis strategy was employed to select genetically significant SNPs for 1091 human serum metabolites, 309 metabolite ratios, and PH. To avoid sample overlap, metabolites and genetic information of PH were selected from independent GWAS datasets in this study. A schematic of this study is demonstrated in Figure 1.Figure 1.Schematic of the Mendelian randomization analysis. Significant instrumental variables were selected to assess the correlation between metabolites and primary hypertension crossing 3 population. The 3 basic assumptions of Mendelian randomization analysis were illustrated in the acyclic graph. SNP = single-nucleotide polymorphism.2.2. GWAS data for human serum metabolitesA genome-wide association aggregate dataset of 1091 human serum metabolites and 309 metabolite ratios involved in this study was obtained by Chen et al[23] These data are publicly available from the GWAS server (http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/gwas/summary_statistics/GCST90199001-GCST90200000). The service platform collects relatively complete human serum metabolomics data. A total of 8299 individuals from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging cohort were included in the GWAS analysis. A total of 248 loci were found to be associated with 690 metabolite levels and 69 loci with 143 metabolite ratios. After integrating metabolite genes and gene expression information, 94 effector genes were identified for 109 metabolites and 48 metabolite ratios. The chemical properties of another 241 unknown or partially characterized metabolites have not been fully determined.2.3. GWAS data for primary hypertensionThe GWAS data of PH among East Asia, Middle East, and Africa populations were obtained from the data of the integrative epidemiology unit open GWAS project (https://gwas.mrcieu.ac.uk/). These summary data were collected from the UK-Biobank cohort in 2020 and GWAS ID were ukb-e-401_EAS, ukb-e-401_MID and ukb-e-401_AFR. In this GWAS meta-analysis, the summary data included 5554 PH cases and 10,922 control cases, yielding a total of 15,530,091 SNPs. We extracted SNPs by analyzing visual component framework files shared by the integrative epidemiology unit platform. The patients with PH were diagnosed according to the standard criteria of the World Health Organization and the International Hypertension Alliance.2.4. Selection of instrumental variablesIn this MR analysis, the selection of instrumental variables was based on 3 basic assumptions. First, we set P < 1 × 10−5 as the genome-wide significance threshold to obtain strongly associated SNPs for each metabolite. Second, a clumping procedure implemented in R software was employed to identify the independent variants. R2 < 0.001 within a 500-kb distance was used to avoid linkage disequilibrium. Third, to quantitatively verify whether the selected SNPs were strongly correlated instruments, we calculated the phenotypic variation explained and the F statistic for each metabolite. Typically, a threshold of F > 10 is suggested for the next operation.[24]2.5. MR analysisA standard inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method was the prioritized evaluation approach used for causal association exploration between metabolites and PH in this analysis. When the instrumental variables satisfy all 3 major hypotheses, the IVW method can provide a more accurate estimate of the causal effect of metabolite and is considered as the most efficient MR method. However, if some instrument variables do not conform to the instrumental variables hypothesis, the analysis may give inaccurate results. Hence, we conducted the following sensitivity analyses: Q tests were performed using the MR-Egger methods to detect heterogeneity between each instrument variable and the possibility of violating the assumption.[25] The MR–Egger intercept was used to estimate the horizontal pleiotropy, ensuring that the genetic variation was independently related to the metabolite and PH[26]; additional approaches such as the weighted median and weighted mode were applied to enhance the reliability and stability of hypothesis testing; and the individual SNP analysis and leave-one-out test were conducted to estimate the likelihood of relevance observed by individual SNPs. To ensure there was no direct association with PH or other confounding factors, candidate SNPs were compared against the human reference genome database.2.6. Metabolic pathway analysisMetabolome enrichment pathways associated with PH were estimated using web-based MetaboAnalyst 5.0. (https://www.Metaboanalyst.ca/, Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, Ottawa, Canada).[27] The pathway and enrichment analysis modules were applied to identify probable metabolite clusters or superpathways that may be associated with metabolic processes and the potential association with PH. The Small Molecule Pathway Database and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database were applied for reference. The significance level of the enrichment pathway was 0.05.2.7. Intersection analysisAn intersection such as meta-analysis was introduced to analyze the shared metabolites screened by the 3 PH datasets, in conjunction with potential pathway mechanisms, to evaluate the polymorphism of related metabolites in different races.2.8. Statistical analysisThe MR analysis was conducted using the “TwoSampleMR” package in R (version 4.3.1), developed by Gibran Hemani, Philip Haycock, Jie Zheng, Tom Gaunt, Ben Elsworth, and Tom Palmer (available at https://mrcieu.github.io/TwoSampleMR/). P < .05 was considered as statistically significant. The odds ratio was used to estimate the magnitude and direction of the metabolic impact with its corresponding 95% confidence interval. If there was missing data, we have chosen to delete it. The circle heatmap was drawn using ChiPlot (https://www.chiplot.online/) (accessed on September 29, 2023).3. Results3.1. Influence of serum metabolites on PHAs the genome-wide significance threshold was P < 1 × 10−5 to select strongly associated SNPs among 1091 human serum metabolites and 309 metabolite ratios, the instrument variables contained 76,267 SNPs in total, with a median of 17 SNPs. Among them, the East Asian population dataset accounted for 28.80%, the Middle East population dataset accounted for 41.63%, and the African population dataset accounted for 29.57%. The F statistic values were all >10, indicating that weak instrumental bias is not detected.All metabolic analyses used IVW as the primary analytical methodology, with no evidence of heterogeneity and no weak instrument variables.[28] In the East Asian population dataset, 36 significantly associated named metabolites were selected (P < .05 for IVW), in which 19 were positively associated with PH and 17 were negatively associated with PH. Carnitine to propionyl carnitine (C3) ratio (P = .0020) was the most significant factor, followed by 4-hydroxychlorothalonil levels (P = .0046) and histidine to alanine ratio (P = .0051) (Fig. 2A). In the Middle East population dataset, 57 significantly associated named metabolites were selected (P < .05 for IVW), in which 24 were positively associated with PH and 33 were negatively associated with PH. Ethyl malonate levels (P = .0002) were the most significant factor, followed by spermidine to ergothioneine ratio (P = .0006) and taurine to glutamate ratio (P = .0017) (Fig. 2B). In the African population dataset, 40 significantly associated named metabolites were selected (P < .05 for IVW), in which 26 were positively associated with PH and 14 were negatively associated with PH. C-glycosyl tryptophan levels (P = .0003) were the most significant factor, followed by caffeic acid sulfate levels (P = .0029) and cortolone glucuronide (1) levels (P = .0030) (Fig. 2C). Figure 3 exhibited the direction of the potential correlation of metabolic involvement in the 3 populations. The results of the alternative analysis, Q test, and sensitivity analysis for the known metabolites are shown in Table 1. All instrument variables passed the sensitivity tests (P > .05).Table 1The 3 Mendelian randomization model estimates of the causal relationships between known metabolites and the risk of primary

In the East Asia dataset, histidine, L-aspartic acid, oxoglutaric acid, pyruvic acid, D-glucose, and phosphate were involved in the metabolic enrichment pathway of ammonia recycling, glucose–alanine cycle, urea cycle, alanine metabolism, malate–aspartate shuttle, and glutamate metabolism (P < .05). Regarding Middle East dataset, 2-ketobutyric acid, choline, and spermidine were involved in the metabolic enrichment pathway of methionine metabolism (P < .05). For Africa dataset, myo-inositol, D-fructose, and phosphate were involved in the metabolic enrichment pathway of galactose metabolism and phosphatidylinositol phosphate metabolism (P < .05) (Table 2). The metabolic mechanism formed by the above metabolites may be involved in the pathogenesis of PH.

Intersection between East Asian, Middle East, and African populationsIntersection analysis was introduced to analyze the shared metabolites screened by the MR analyses. The cross-sectional and meta-analysis of strongly correlated metabolites across the 3 ethnic groups revealed that 7 metabolites were consistently identified, 5 of which were previously known. Among these, isoleucine (odds ratio = 0.74, 95% confidence interval: 0.56–0.96) emerged as a protective factor for PH across all 3 ethnic groups (Figs. 4 and 5A–E).Figure 4.Venn diagram of metabolites’ intersection between East Asian, Middle East, and Africa populations.Figure 5.Illustration of the pooled causal effects of 5 known intersecting metabolic factors.

DiscussionOur study found 36, 57, and 40 known metabolites were strongly related to PH in East Asian, Middle Eastern, and African populations, respectively. Histidine, L-aspartic acid, oxoglutaric acid, pyruvic acid, D-glucose, and phosphate were found to be involved in the metabolic enrichment pathway of ammonia recycling, glucose–alanine cycle, urea cycle, alanine metabolism, malate–aspartate shuttle, and glutamate metabolism in East Asian population. 2-Ketobutyric acid, choline, and spermidine were involved in the metabolic enrichment pathway of methionine metabolism among the Middle East population. Myo-inositol, D-fructose, and phosphate were found to be involved in the metabolic enrichment pathway of galactose metabolism and phosphatidylinositol phosphate metabolism for African people. Of the metabolites that were found to be strongly correlated among the 3 races in both cross-sectional and meta-analyses, 7 were consistently identified, 5 of which were previously known with name (N-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate, taurolithocholate 3-sulfate, isoleucine, N-acetyl-2-aminoadipate, and myo-inositol level) L-aspartic acid, oxoglutaric acid, pyruvic acid, and phosphate were crucial metabolites involved in the enrichment pathways in East Asia population. Isoleucine was demonstrated as a protective factor of PH across the 3 populations. N-acetyl-2-aminoadipate was found to be positively associated with PH in the Africa group, and negatively associated with the East Asian and Middle East populations. Myo-inositol was a risk factor for both African and Middle East groups, but a protective factor for the East Asian population.Several studies have reported that alanine involved in the glucose–alanine cycle was associated with reduced ammonia excretion and directly affected the ammonia cycle.[29–31] Some studies have found dietary alanine was associated with higher systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP).[32,33] Yet, a cohort study has suggested that alanine tended to diminish the risk of hypertension.[34] Urea cycle disorder can result in hypertension, there is a clear pathophysiological relationship between them.[35] Certain scholars have discovered that the urea cycle may contribute to the availability of precursors for nitric oxide synthesis, ultimately leading to neonatal pulmonary hypertension.[36,37] Hypertension shared common metabolic patterns with dyslipidemia, including alanine metabolism and glutamate metabolism, suggesting potential intervention targets could be provided to patients with both hypertension and dyslipidemia.[38] It was discovered in the Dahl salt-sensitive rat, a model of salt-sensitive hypertension, that aspartate or malate can increase levels of L-arginine and nitric oxide, thereby reducing hypertension.[39] Another study found that a high salt diet can induce hypertension of liver-Yang hyperactivity syndrome by mediating the microbiota associated with the glutamate/γ-aminobutyric acid–glutamine metabolic cycle via the gut–brain axis.[40] Methionine metabolism was involved in endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerosis, and renal fibrosis. It can cause early hypertensive nephrosclerosis.[41] A previous study proposed that methionine-enriched diet could induce elevated SBP.[42,43] Galactose ingestion, like glucose, was reported to result in significantly lesser increases in blood pressure compared with fructose ingestion,[44] indicating its involvement in blood pressure regulation through galactose metabolism. Impaired phosphoinositide metabolism has been found linked to calcium-handling abnormalities associated with hypertension.[45]L-aspartic acid has been reported to possess notable clinical significance because of its effectiveness in the treatment of hypertension.[46] It has been observed that 2-oxoglutaric acid had abnormal rhythms and contents in hypertension.[47] Plasma pyruvic acid was found to be associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension.[48] Pyruvate acid could change continuously in hypertension progression.[49] Inorganic phosphate might serve as a crucial dietary risk factor for hypertension. The potential mechanisms could be dietary phosphorus excess induces hypertension including activation of the SNS, impaired endothelial function, increased vascular stiffness, and renal sodium retention.[50] In addition, supplementation of inositol has shown promising results in significantly reducing both SBP and DBP.[51] Moreover, myo-inositol supplementation has demonstrated a notable decrease in the overall incidence of pregnancy-induced hypertension.[52] All these prior findings were aligned with our study, emphasizing these metabolites are really crucial in the enrichment pathways influencing PH.Numerous studies have stated that isoleucine–proline–proline/valine–proline–proline lactotripeptides can significantly reduce office SBP in both Asian and European populations.[53–55] Another study discovered that the combination of isoleucine–tryptophan with whey protein hydrolysate effectively inhibits plasma angiotensin-1-converting enzyme, leading to antihypertensive effects.[56] These findings highlight the importance of isoleucine as an essential amino acid in managing hypertension. Our study verified the causal correlations between isoleucine and PH among African, Middle East, and East Asian populations based on MR analysis. N-acetyl-2-aminoadipate was found to be a positive predictor on DBP according to another MR analysis focus on the European population.[21] Our study contributes to existing literature by demonstrating that N-acetyl-2-aminoadipate was demonstrated as a risk factor of PH in the African group, but a protective factor in East Asian and Middle East populations. A meta-analysis concluded that inositol supplementation can significantly decrease SBP and DBP, but further large-scale RCTs are still needed to confirm these findings.[51] Interestingly, myo-inositol showed as risk factor in both African and Middle East groups in our study.There are certain limitations in our study. First, our findings need to be verified by clinical trials or longitudinal studies, particularly large-scale RCTs, to explore their therapeutic potential. Second, we must examine the role of specific metabolites in the development of PH to understand the underlying mechanisms. Our next step will involve using multiomics data to analyze and validate potential mediators. Finally, further research is needed on 2 unidentified metabolites that exhibit overlapping characteristics across different racial groups, as they may have important clinical implications.5. ConclusionOur study discovered several metabolites having causal relationships with PH across East Asian, Middle East, and African populations. Isoleucine might be a valuable amino acid in the prevention or treatment for PH.AcknowledgmentsWe are grateful to all the participants and investigators of the study, as well as to all the investigators who contributed to the genome-wide association study of modifiable risk factors.Author contributionsFunding acquisition: Yi Chen.Writing – original draft: Ying Shi, Hairun Liu.Conceptualization: Yi Chen.Data curation: Yi Chen.Formal analysis: Yi Chen.Writing – review & editing: Yi Chen.Supplementary Material"}
{"PMCID": "12155871", "title": "Efficacy and Safety of Intranasal Etripamil for Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia: Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials", "abstract": "Background: Patients with arrhythmias, particularly paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT), face an increased risk of cardiac complications. Currently, non-parenteral medications for rapid PSVT cessation are lacking. Etripamil, a novel intranasal, short-acting calcium channel blocker, offers a rapid onset and the potential for unsupervised PSVT management. However, data on its use in arrhythmia management remain limited. Aims: We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of 70 mg of etripamil compared with placebo in the treatment of PSVT. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from inception to April 2025. We calculated pooled risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using random or common effects models, depending on the heterogeneity. Results: Four RCTs including 540 patients were analyzed. Etripamil demonstrated higher conversion rates to the sinus rhythm at 15 min (RR 1.84 [95% CI: 1.32–2.48]), 30 min (RR 1.80 [95% CI: 1.38–2.35]), and 60 min (RR 1.24 [95% CI: 1.04–1.48]). PSVT recurrence rates were similar between groups (RR 0.52 [95% CI: 0.20–1.34]). Adverse events (AEs) and severe AEs were comparable between etripamil and the placebo. Etripamil was associated with higher rates of nasal discomfort, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and epistaxis but not with increased bradyarrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, or non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. Conclusions: Etripamil appears to be a promising treatment for cardiac arrhythmias. Larger long-term RCTs are needed to confirm its safety and efficacy in clinical practice.", "body": "1. IntroductionParoxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) is defined as a regular, typically narrow-complex tachyarrhythmia that arises from or conducts through the atria or the atrioventricular node and is commonly encountered in clinical practice. PSVT often results from a reentry circuit and can be categorized by its anatomic location, with two common types: atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) and atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) [1]. AVNRT, the most common subtype, occurs when electrical impulses travel through two pathways within the AV node, while AVRT involves reentry via an accessory pathway. Although PSVT is usually not life-threatening, its sudden, disruptive, and sometimes disabling symptoms can significantly impair one’s quality of life [2].Based on retrospective analyses of American clinical databases, it is estimated that PSVT affects approximately 1 in 300 individuals, corresponding to about 1.26 million people in the United States, with the highest rates observed among older and female patients [1,2]. Patients often present with abrupt-onset palpitations, chest discomfort, dizziness, or dyspnea. Diagnosis is aided by 12-lead electrocardiograms (EKGs) obtained during arrhythmic events or a sinus rhythm to identify arrhythmogenicity and guide further management, in line with ACC, AHA, and HRS guidelines [3].Current guidelines recommend first-line treatment of PSVT in an acute setting with vagal maneuvers or adenosine, followed by beta blockers or non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCBs), such as verapamil or diltiazem, for stable PSVT and synchronized cardioversion for unstable PSVT [4]. However, these therapies require hospitalization, highlighting the need for a safe, rapid, and effective treatment option suitable for outpatient use. The intranasal route offers a compelling alternative, as the posterior nasal mucosa enables rapid systemic drug absorption [5]. In terms of interventional management, percutaneous catheter ablation is recommended as first-line therapy for PSVT in international guidelines [6,7]. Although ablation achieves high success rates (97% in AVNRT and 93% in AVRT), it carries procedural risks and may not be accessible or acceptable to all patients [8]. Available oral therapies, meanwhile, carry risks of hypotension and heart failure exacerbation, highlighting the need for novel therapeutic options [5].Recent research has focused on developing a nonparenteral medication capable of rapid PSVT termination and suitable for patient self-administration outside healthcare settings. Etripamil, an intranasal, non-dihydropyridine L-type CCB, has a rapid onset of action, short half-life, and minimal systemic adverse effects compared with intravenous agents [9]. Clinical trials have suggested that intranasal etripamil could provide a safe, practical outpatient option for acute self-termination of paroxysmal SVT without the severe systemic adverse effects that come with intravenous drugs [10,11].The NODE-301 trial, a phase 3, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, demonstrated that etripamil was superior to a placebo in converting PSVT to a sinus rhythm [12]. The subsequent study conducted across North America and Europe included 184 patients who tolerated a test dose of 70 mg of intranasal etripamil [13]. Participants self-administered an initial dose of etripamil or a placebo and a second dose if symptoms persisted. Etripamil also reported higher rates of conversion back to the sinus rhythm and a shorter time to conversion [14]. Etripamil was generally well tolerated, with adverse effects limited to mild, transient nasal symptoms.Given these promising results, we conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intranasal etripamil for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias.2. MethodologyWe conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis while following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2) and the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis [15,16]. The prespecified study protocol has been registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024544315).2.1. Search StrategyWe systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, SCOPUS, and the Cochrane Library for relevant articles from inception until April 2025. The search targeted studies evaluating the efficacy of intranasal etripamil for ventricular arrhythmias. No restrictions were applied regarding language or publication year. We also searched the gray literature and reviewed the reference lists of relevant studies. When necessary, the study authors were contacted for additional data.We performed medical subject heading (MeSH) and keyword searches using Boolean operators (AND, OR). The search strategy combined the following terms: ((etripamil) AND (“supraventricular tachycardia” OR SVT OR “paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia” OR PSVT OR “cardiac arrhythmia”)). All references were downloaded for consolidation, duplicate removal, and further analysis.2.2. Eligibility CriteriaEligible studies met the following criteria:Randomized controlled trials (RCTs);Inclusion of patients with PSVT;Administration of etripamil (70 mg) via the intranasal route;English language publication’Reporting of primary clinical outcomes, including conversion to a sinus rhythm or recurrence of arrhythmic events.We excluded studies which met the following criteria:Did not include adult human participants;Lacked safety data on adverse events (AEs), treatment-emergent serious adverse events (TESAEs), or other prespecified outcomes (nasal discomfort, epistaxis, etc.);Did not have a comparator group;Did not report the timepoints for conversion to a normal sinus rhythm;Had incomplete or unpublished data, abstracts without full peer-reviewed publications, or registered protocols without results.Two investigators (M.J. and D.S.) independently screened titles and abstracts for relevance. Full-text articles were assessed against the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Discrepancies were resolved through discussion or adjudication by a third reviewer (S.P.). Study selection was documented using a PRISMA flow diagram.2.3. Data ExtractionTwo reviewers independently extracted data into a standardized Excel spreadsheet. The extracted variables included the first author, publication year, country, number of participants, and baseline characteristics (age, sex, and body mass index [BMI]). The outcomes collected were the rates of conversion to a sinus rhythm at 15, 30, 60, and 300 min post administration; recurrence of PSVT; and incidence of AF, bradyarrhythmia, and NSVT. The rates of conversion were study design-based and used in the studies included in our meta-analysis. We also extracted the AE, TESAE, nasal discomfort, nasal congestion, epistaxis, and rhinorrhea rates. Any discrepancies were resolved through discussion.2.4. Risk of Bias AssessmentWe assessed the risk of bias using the Revised Cochrane Collaboration’s Risk of Bias (RoB-2) tool v0.3.0 [17]. This tool evaluates bias related to randomization, deviations from intended interventions, missing outcome data, outcome measurement, and selective reporting. We visualized the risk of bias assessments using the ROBVIS tool [18]. Given the limited number of included studies (n = 4), we did not assess publication bias.2.5. Statistical AnalysisWe conducted meta-analyses using RevMan software version 5.4.1. We pooled dichotomous outcomes and calculated risk ratios (RRs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) as the effect measures. Analyses were initially performed using fixed effect models. Random effect models were applied when significant heterogeneity was detected. We assessed heterogeneity using the chi-square test (with a significance level of α < 0.1) and quantified it using Higgins’ I2 statistic, with I2 > 50% considered indicative of substantial heterogeneity [19]. In cases of significant heterogeneity, we performed sensitivity analyses by sequentially excluding individual studies to explore potential sources.3. Results3.1. Study SelectionOur search identified 72 records (PubMed: 20; Scopus: 29; Cochrane Library: 23). After removing 28 duplicates, we screened the titles and abstracts, excluding those that did not meet the eligibility criteria. Thirty full-text articles were assessed, and 12 were excluded for reasons detailed in the PRISMA flowchart (Supplementary Figure S1). Ultimately, four studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in this systematic review [20,21,22,23].3.2. Study and Patient CharacteristicsThe study characteristics and baseline patient demographics are shown in Table 1. The included trials were conducted in Belgium, Canada, Hungary, the Netherlands, and the United States, with publication dates ranging from 2018 to 2023. Together, the four trials enrolled 540 patients, of whom 199 were male (36.9%). The largest study included 196 participants (35.9%), and the smallest one had 56 participants (10.4%). The mean age of the participants ranged from 52.2 to 64.6 years. Two trials reported body mass index (BMI) data, with the mean BMI ranging between 29.2 and 29.4 kg/m2.3.3. Primary Clinical OutcomesThree trials reported rates of conversion to a sinus rhythm at 15, 30, and 60 min post administration. At 15 min, 106 of the 229 patients (46.3%) in the etripamil group converted to a sinus rhythm, compared with 40 of the 154 patients (26.0%) in the placebo group. Etripamil was associated with a higher rate of conversion to a sinus rhythm at 15 min (RR = 1.84 [95% CI: 1.32–2.48], I2 = 0%). At 30 min, 122 of 233 patients (52.3%) in the etripamil group converted to sinus rhythm, compared with 45 of 163 patients (27.7%) in the placebo group. Etripamil was associated with a higher rate of conversion to a sinus rhythm at 30 min (RR = 1.80 [95% CI: 1.38–2.35], I2 = 5%) (Figure 1a).At 60 min, 142 of the 233 patients (60.9%) in the etripamil group achieved conversion to a sinus rhythm, compared with 76 of 163 patients (46.6%) in the placebo group. Etripamil was associated with a higher rate of conversion to a sinus rhythm at 60 min (RR = 1.24 [95% CI: 1.04–1.48], I2 = 0%) (Figure 1b).Two trials reported conversion to a sinus rhythm at 300 min. At 300 min, 161 of the 206 patients (78.2%) in the etripamil group achieved conversion to a sinus rhythm, compared with 95 of 134 patients (70.9%) in the placebo group. Etripamil was not associated with a significantly higher rate of conversion to a sinus rhythm at 300 min (RR = 1.11 [95% CI: 0.97–1.26], I2 = 17%) (Figure 1c).Two studies reported recurrence rates of PSVT after the administration of etripamil or placebo. The recurrence rate was 7 of the 266 patients (2.6%) in the etripamil group, compared with 9 of 175 patients (5.1%) in the placebo group. Etripamil was not associated with an increased rate of PSVT recurrence (RR = 0.52 [95% CI: 0.20–1.34], I2 = 0%) (Figure 1d).The pooled risk ratio for the combined effect is depicted in Figure 2, which generally favors etripamil.3.4. Secondary OutcomesTwo studies reported rates of bradyarrhythmia, atrial fibrillation (AF), and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT). In the etripamil group, 2 of 155 patients (1.3%) had bradyarrhythmia, 1 of 155 (0.6%) had AF, and 33 of 266 (12.4%) had NSVT. In the placebo group, 1 of 145 patients (0.7%) had bradyarrhythmia, 5 of 145 (3.4%) had AF, and 26 of 176 (14.8%) had NSVT. Etripamil was not associated with an increased incidence of bradyarrhythmia (RR = 1.49 [95% CI: 0.26–8.38], I2 = 40%), AF (RR = 0.26 [95% CI: 0.04–1.55], I2 = 0%), or NSVT (RR = 0.88 [95% CI: 0.54–1.43], I2 = 0%) (Figure 3a–c).Three studies reported the incidence of nasal discomfort, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and epistaxis. In the etripamil group, 74 of 264 patients (28.0%) reported nasal discomfort, 30 of 264 (11.4%) reported nasal congestion, 29 of 264 (11.0%) reported rhinorrhea, and 19 of 264 (7.2%) reported epistaxis. In the placebo group, 21 of 174 patients (12.1%) reported nasal discomfort, 4 of 174 (2.3%) reported nasal congestion, 5 of 174 (2.9%) reported rhinorrhea, and 2 of 174 (1.1%) reported epistaxis. Etripamil was associated with a higher incidence of nasal congestion (RR = 5.06 [95% CI: 1.86–13.81], I2 = 23%), nasal discomfort (RR = 2.58 [95% CI: 1.25–5.32], I2 = 61%), rhinorrhea (RR = 4.52 [95% CI: 1.81–11.32], I2 = 0%), and epistaxis (RR = 4.74 [95% CI: 1.38–16.30], I2 = 0%) (Figure 3d–g).Three trials reported the rates of any adverse events (AEs) and treatment-emergent serious adverse events (TESAEs). In the etripamil group, 46 of 149 patients (30.9%) reported AEs, compared with 33 of 134 (24.6%) in the placebo group. Etripamil was not associated with a higher incidence of AEs (RR = 2.12 [95% CI: 0.06–80.60], I2 = 98%) (Figure 3g). Sensitivity analysis following the removal of the study by Camm et al. [23] showed that the heterogeneity dropped substantially from 98% to 0%. However, the risk ratio increased to 3.79 [95% CI: 1.59–9.04] [23] (Supplementary Figure S2).TESAEs occurred in 1 of 147 patients (0.7%) in the etripamil group, compared with 3 of 164 (1.8%) in the placebo group. Etripamil was not associated with a higher rate of TESAEs (RR = 0.47 [95% CI: 0.07–3.08], I2 = 0%) (Figure 3h).3.5. Risk of AssessmentAll four RCTs [20,21,22,23] reported the primary clinical outcome of conversion to a sinus rhythm at 15, 30, 60, or 300 min following intranasal etripamil administration. The Revised Cochrane Collaboration’s Risk of Bias (RoB-2) tool was used to evaluate the risk of bias [18]. Risk of bias assessments indicated low risk or minor concerns across the studies (Supplementary Figure S3). Each trial employed centralized randomization procedures with appropriate allocation concealment, minimizing the risk of selection bias. Blinding of the participants was adequately performed using matched placebos, thereby reducing the potential for bias. Outcome data were nearly complete in all studies. Additionally, all reported outcomes corresponded with prespecified protocols, limiting the risk of selective reporting.4. DiscussionThe objective of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of 70 mg of etripamil compared with placebo in the treatment of PSVT. The incidence of PSVT is approximately 36 per 100,000 persons and is notably female predominant. Vagal maneuvers are currently recommended as a first-line treatment for SVT. However, their efficacy is highly variable [24]. When vagal maneuvers fail, pharmacological therapies such as adenosine, intravenous non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, or beta blockers are used for stable SVT [25], typically requiring in-patient management. Our pooled analysis revealed that etripamil significantly improved conversion to a sinus rhythm at 15, 30, and 60 min without an associated increase in adverse events (AEs) or treatment-emergent serious adverse events (TESAEs). PSVT recurrence rates and overall adverse events, including severe events, were similar between groups. However, etripamil was linked to more nasal side effects (discomfort, congestion, rhinorrhea, and epistaxis) without an increased risk of serious cardiac arrhythmias. Etripamil appears to be a relatively safer and more effective alternative to current systemic treatments, especially given its potential for outpatient use. Unlike systemic interventions that necessitate inpatient monitoring, etripamil has demonstrated superior efficacy and safety when administered intranasally in an outpatient setting.Among key clinical trials, the NODE-301 study showed a conversion rate of 53.7% to a sinus rhythm following a single intranasal dose of etripamil. However, it did not demonstrate a significant benefit at 300 min post administration. Consistently, our pooled analysis revealed that at the 5 h mark, the arrhythmia converted into a sinus rhythm, but this was not statically significant. The RAPID trial, a sequel to NODE-301, investigated a double-dose strategy with two administrations of intranasal etripamil 10 min apart, leading to improved conversion rates at both 30 min (HR = 2.62 [95% CI: 1.66–4.15]) and 300 min (HR = 1.70 [95% CI: 1.21–2.38]). Nevertheless, when these data were pooled in our analysis, the conversion rate at 300 min did not reach statistical significance (RR = 1.11 [95% CI: 0.97–1.26]).Our updated meta-analysis, including over 540 participants and incorporating studies up to April 2025, builds upon prior systematic reviews such as that by Abuelazm et al. [26]. Consistent with their findings, etripamil demonstrated a statistically significant conversion to a sinus rhythm at 15, 30, and 60 min. While both analyses observed a higher incidence of AEs with etripamil use, the difference was not statistically significant in our results (30.9% in the etripamil group versus 24.6% in the placebo group; RR = 2.12 [95% CI: 1.38–2.35]) [26].Current 2020 AHA guidelines recommend adenosine as a first-line agent for PSVT. Although adenosine effectively terminates SVT by transiently blocking conduction through the AV node, it is associated with significant side effects such as bronchospasm, facial flushing, chest discomfort, and a sense of impending doom [25]. Comparative analyses, including the systematic review by Delaney et al., have shown that adenosine has a higher rate of adverse events compared with verapamil, which in turn has a higher incidence of hypotension [27]. Compared with these systemic therapies, etripamil offers the advantages of rapid onset, intranasal delivery, and the potential for self-administration without medical supervision.The REVERT trial demonstrated improved efficacy in SVT termination, using a modified Valsalva maneuver compared with the standard maneuver. However, the modified Valsalva maneuver requires healthcare provider assistance, whereas etripamil can be self-administered [28]. Although the modified Valsalva maneuver is effective, prior reviews suggested that etripamil provides superior success rates in PSVT termination [24,25,26].Etripamil’s adverse events were primarily local and self-limited, with higher rates of nasal discomfort, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and epistaxis compared with placebo. Nevertheless, episodes of nasal side effects were transient, and no serious long-term complications were reported. However, none of our included studies discussed whether the adverse events were self-limiting or contributed to patient compliance. Importantly, etripamil was not associated with an increased incidence of bradyarrhythmias (RR = 1.49 [95% CI: 0.26–8.38]), atrial fibrillation (RR = 0.26 [95% CI: 0.04–1.55]), or non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (RR = 0.88 [95% CI: 0.54–1.43]) [29].5. LimitationsDespite its promising efficacy and safety profile, this study has several limitations that should be acknowledged. First, the available evidence is largely based on a limited number of clinical trials with relatively small sample sizes conducted in geographically restricted populations. This may affect the generalizability of the results to broader groups, including individuals with significant comorbidities and diverse ethnic backgrounds.Furthermore, the majority of the included studies assessed only short-term outcomes, providing little information about the long-term safety, effectiveness, and tolerability of etripamil. For example, the NODE-301 trial’s primary endpoint focused on termination of PSVT at 5 h, potentially underestimating the rapid action benefits of etripamil.Future research should address these limitations by including larger and more diverse populations and conducting long-term follow-up studies to better assess persistent therapeutic outcomes and late adverse effects. Additionally, our meta-analysis was limited to data from only four randomized controlled trials, restricting the ability to perform more detailed subgroup analyses based on age, sex, comorbidities, or other important clinical factors.As such, larger trials encompassing a wider range of populations and more detailed subgroup analyses are necessary to confirm and expand upon the findings of this review.6. ConclusionsEtripamil exhibits significant promise as a future therapeutic option for the management of PSVT. Clinical trials have demonstrated its favorable effects in achieving conversion to a sinus rhythm and its relatively benign side effect profile compared with placebo and standard intravenous therapies. The ease of intranasal self-administration without the need for healthcare supervision enhances its potential utility in outpatient settings, low-resource areas, and among patients with limited access to immediate medical care.However, to fully establish the role of etripamil in PSVT management, further studies with larger, more diverse patient populations are needed. Future research should also evaluate the safety and efficacy of etripamil in special populations, including pregnant women, children, and the elderly, and assess long-term outcomes following repeated or chronic use."}

The triglyceride glucose-waist circumference (TyG-WC) index, a novel measure for assessing IR, may hold significant predictive value for NAFLD. However, the relationship between TyG-WC and the risk of NAFLD remains elusive. To investigate this association, this comprehensive meta-analysis was conducted.MethodsA systematic electronic search was conducted using the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases from their inception until July 2024 to identify observational studies assessing the relationship between TyG-WC and the risk of NAFLD. Joanna Briggs Institute’s critical appraisal checklist was utilized to evaluate the quality of cross-sectional studies, while the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) score was used to assess cohort studies. The principal summary outcomes included the mean difference (MD) and the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI).ResultsIn total, 10 studies comprising 38,518 participants were included in this meta-analysis, of whom 37% were diagnosed with NAFLD. The analysis revealed a significant MD between NAFLD and non-NAFLD cases (MD, 137.41; [95% CI, 121.52-153.31]).ConclusionA significant MD was identified between NAFLD and non-NAFLD cases. The TyG-WC index was found to be positively correlated with the risk of NAFLD, suggesting that it may serve as a potential indicator for NAFLD.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12876-025-03888-x.", "body": "IntroductionFollowing the proposal to redefine non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) as metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), the condition has now been officially reclassified as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) [1]. Currently, the global prevalence of NAFLD is approximately 30.2%, with regional variations of 30.9% in Asia, 16.1% in Australia, 30.2% in Europe, 29% in North America, and 34% in South America [2]. Given its high prevalence, this condition has become a major public health concern, particularly due to its strong association with metabolic comorbidities, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome [3]. In addition, NAFLD has the potential to progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, compensated/decompensated cirrhosis, or even hepatocellular carcinoma [4, 5]. To date, no agents have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of NAFLD, although several drugs are in various stages of development. The primary treatment for NAFLD remains weight loss [6]. When weight loss through diet and exercise is difficult to achieve or sustain, bariatric surgery can facilitate long-term weight reduction [7]. In clinical practice, most NAFLD diagnoses rely on abdominal ultrasound, which has limited ability to quantify fat infiltration. Although it is highly sensitive for detecting moderate-to-severe fatty liver, its accuracy may be reduced in individuals with abdominal obesity [8, 9]. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including MRI-proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) and magnetic resonance elastography (MRE), provides an accurate and noninvasive assessment of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis [10]. However, its implementation remains constrained by technical feasibility and the time required to complete the examination. The gold diagnostic standard for NAFLD relies on liver biopsy results. However, it has well-known limitations, including invasiveness, poor acceptability, sampling variability, and high cost [11]. Therefore, early identifying at-risk populations for NAFLD using simple and effective diagnostic tools is essential.The homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), an important marker for evaluating IR [12], has been extensively applied to IR-related diseases and serves as a diagnostic criterion for NAFLD. However, in primary care, as circulating insulin concentrations are rarely measured, alternative indices, such as the Fatty Liver Index (FLI) [13], triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index, have been developed to assess IR [14, 15]. The prevalence of NAFLD has exhibited to increase progressively with higher TyG index values [16], highlighting the role of elevated levels of triglycerides in liver fat accumulation. Moreover, TyG-associated parameters, including triglyceride glucose-waist-to-height ratio (TyG-WHtR), triglyceride glucose-waist circumference (TyG-WC), and triglyceride glucose-body mass index (TyG-BMI) can effectively identify NAFLD in the Japanese population [17]. These indicators are easy to measure and can be obtained through routine medical examinations.To date, few studies have concentrated on the correlation between TyG-WC and the risk of NAFLD, and it remains controversial whether an increase in TyG-WC is indicative of NAFLD in the general adult population. Therefore, this meta-analysis aimed to comprehensively explore the association between TyG-WC and the risk of NAFLD.MethodsProtocol registration and search strategyThe study protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews, http://www.york.ac.uk/inst/crd) under registration number of CRD42024580557. A comprehensive search was carried out using the Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Science, PubMed, China Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Database for Chinese Technical Periodicals (VIP), Wanfang Database, and other relevant databases, covering publications from their inception until July 2024. The specific retrieval strategy is detailed in Supplementary Table 1.Study selection and eligibility criteriaAccording to the PICOS criteria (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome, and Study Design), the inclusion criteria were summarized as follows: (1) adults (age > 18 years old); (2) hepatic steatosis confirmed histologically through ultrasonography, by computed tomography (CT), or using noninvasive biomarkers and scores; (3) comparison of high TyG-WC index versus low TyG-WC index; (4) availability of mean and standard deviation (SD), or ability to calculate them; (5) observational studies published as full-length articles. The exclusion criteria were defined as follows: (1) studies involving patients with secondary causes of hepatic steatosis; (2) studies lacking relevant data or from which data could not be extracted; (3) reviews, meta-analyses, congress abstracts, nonhuman studies, or in vitro studies; (4) publications in languages other than English. Two investigators (Ziyi Xin and Lanlan Feng) independently conducted each phase of the study from screening of the included studies to data analysis, and the results of the searches were imported into EndNote 21 software (Clarivate, 2021). Following removal of duplicates, the included articles were finally selected by reviewing titles, abstracts, and full texts. Any disagreements were resolved through consultation or, if necessary, by a third investigator (Qingwen Yu). The calculation formulas used in the analysis are as follows: BMI = weight (kg)/height2 (m2); TyG-WC = Ln [TG (mg/dL) × FPG (mg/dL)/2] × WC (cm).Data collection and assessment of the quality of the included studiesThe relevant characteristics of the included studies were extracted into an electronic database, including: (1) study details, such as the first author’s name, year of publication, country or region, and study design; (2) participants’ information, including the number, age, and sex of participants in both the NAFLD and non-NAFLD groups; (3) diagnostic methods used for NAFLD; and (4) comparison of TyG-WC level in the NAFLD group with that in the control group. The quality of the cross-sectional studies was assessed using Joanna Briggs Institute’s critical appraisal checklist, with responses categorized as “yes”, “no”, “unclear”, or “not applicable”. For cohort studies, quality was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) score, assigning a quality score ranging from 1 to 9 stars based on eight criteria, with a higher number of stars indicating a higher study quality (Supplementary Table 2). The certainty of evidence for each outcome was appraised using the GRADE approach, in which factors, such as risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias were considered (Supplementary Table 4). The risk of bias in the included studies was assessed using the ROBINS-E tool, which biases were evaluated across seven domains (Supplementary Table 5).Statistical analysisThe statistical analysis was conducted using the Review Manager (RevMan) 5.4 and Stata 14.0 software. For studies that reported the median and interquartile range (IQR), the mean and SD were calculated. This meta-analysis used TyG-WC as the primary outcome, and TyG-WC was presented as mean ± SD. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistics and the Chi-squared (X²) test; an I² value greater than 50% was indicative of high heterogeneity. A random-effects model was used to synthesize the data, as it is considered as a more robust approach for accounting for potential heterogeneity among the included studies. To assess publication bias, a funnel plot, Egger’s test, and Begg’s test were conducted. The leave-one-out sensitivity analysis was performed by removing each study individually to assess its impact on the overall effect estimate. If a study was identified as contributing to high heterogeneity, subgroup analysis was conducted to explore the sources of the heterogeneity.ResultsSearch resultsThe process of literature search and screening is summarized in a PRISMA flowchart (Fig. 1). A total of 114 articles were initially retrieved, involving 26 from the PubMed, 26 from the EMBASE, 25 from the Web of Science, 24 from the VIP database, 7 from the Wanfang database, 4 from the CNKI, and 2 from the CBM. After removing duplicate records and reviewing titles and abstracts, 89 studies were excluded. One study was excluded due to the unavailability of the full text. The full texts of the remaining 24 studies were reviewed, and 14 were excluded for the following reasons: (1) lack of relevant data; (2) concentration on different populations, exposures, or outcomes; and (3) publication in languages other than English.\nFig. 1Flow chart of the study selection processCharacteristics and quality assessment of the included studiesThe characteristics of the included studies are presented in Table 1. In this meta-analysis, 10 studies comprising 14,473 NAFLD cases and 38,518 participants were included [18–27]. Overall, the sample sizes of the included studies ranged from 175 to 20,922, and the mean age ranged from 43.9 to 52.6 years old. Besides, ultrasound or CT was used in all the included studies for diagnosing NAFLD. Among these articles, 9 cross-sectional studies were assessed by the Joanna Briggs Institute’s critical appraisal checklist, and the remaining were cohort studies that were evaluated by NOS scores. After evaluation of selection, comparability, and outcomes, the studies were regarded as high-quality. All the included studies were assessed using the ROBINS-E tool, and they were judged to have a low risk of bias across all domains. Therefore, the conclusions of this meta-analysis are considered reliable and not significantly affected by bias. Based on the GRADE approach, the overall quality of evidence was rated as low. Despite this, the findings remain valuable for understanding the association between TyG-WC level and the risk of NAFLD.\nTable 1Characteristics of studies contained in the meta-analysesReferences(First Author,Year,Country/Region)Source ofparticipantsParticipantCharacteristicsNAFLDdiagnosisStudydesignCase/NMeanage(years),Male(%)MeanBMI(kg/m²)Chang,2023,Chinathe Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical UniversityGeneralpopulationUltrasoundcross-sectional study8099/20,92243.9,58.924.4Han,2024,KoreaNAGeneralpopulationAbdominopelvic CT scancross-sectional study150/85252.60,59.724.6Xue,2022,ChinaNHANESGeneralpopulationVibration controlled transient elastographycross-sectional study737/172751.2,47.828.4Khamseh,2024,IranIran University of Medical SciencesGeneralpopulationFibroScancross-sectional study320/64450.2,46.929.7Chen,2024,ChinaNHANESGeneralpopulationUltrasoundcohort study3672/10,39045,51.626.7Yu,2023,ChinaFirst Hospital ofNanping City,Fujian Medical UniversityGeneralpopulationUltrasoundcross-sectional study726/260545.0,56.522.9Bockarie,2023,GhanaCape Coast Teaching HospitaGeneralpopulationUltrasoundcross-sectional study52/21051.3,27.827.5Peng,2023,ChinaNHANESGeneralpopulationUltrasoundcross-sectional study499/80945.9,50.428.3Khamseh,2021,IranNRPatients with overweight/obeseFibroScancross-sectional study96/18444.7,50.530.4Malek,2021,IranIran University ofMedical sciencesPatients withT2DMFibroScancross-sectional study122/17548.9,45.730.2NAFLD, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease; BMI, body mass index; NR, not reported\nAssociation between TyG-WC and the risk of NAFLDTen studies compared TyG-WC level between NAFLD patients and non-NAFLD controls. The results of the summary analysis are illustrated in Fig. 2. The results revealed an overall mean difference (MD) of 137.41 (95% confidence interval (CI): 121.52-153.31). A significant heterogeneity was also found (I2 = 96%, P < 0.00001). The study [27], due to its large combined sample size, might significantly contribute to the high heterogeneity (I² = 96%) found in the meta-analysis.\nFig. 2Meta-analysis of studies reporting TyG-WC in NAFLD vs. non-NAFLD subjects using a random-effects model and a MD with 95% CI\nSensitivity analysis and publication biasThe combined results remained consistent with the original results when any study was omitted from the sensitivity analysis. The results were stable when the fixed-effects model was used, yielding a MD of 147.01 (95% CI, 144.88-149.15) (Fig. 3).\nFig. 3Meta-analysis of studies reporting TyG-WC in NAFLD vs. non-NAFLD subjects using a fix-effects model and a MD with 95% CI\nThe funnel plot is displayed in Fig. 4. Moreover, the Begg’s test (P= 0.592) and Egger’s test (P= 0.526) were conducted, indicating no publication bias in either test (Supplementary Fig. 1).\nFig. 4Funnel plot of meta-analysis\nSubgroup analysisTaking into account the influences of regional dietary habits, lifestyle, and genetic factors, subgroup analysis was conducted based on geographical region, age, and BMI. The results indicated that the interaction between mean age, BMI, geographical region, and TyG-WC was not significant (Fig. 5). Significant heterogeneity was found in these subgroups, suggesting that these factors were not the primary sources of heterogeneity. This finding supports the generalizability of TyG-WC as a potential predictor of NAFLD risk across various regions, age groups, and BMI categories.\nFig. 5Subgroup analysis of TyG-WC and risk of NAFLD. (A) Subgroup analysis according to Asia and non-Asia. (B) Subgroup analysis according to age. (C) Subgroup analysis according to BMI\nMeta-regression analysisA univariate meta-regression analysis was conducted to explore study-level factors that may account for the high heterogeneity observed across studies. NAFLD diagnosis, population type, and study type were not found to be sources of heterogeneity(Supplementary Table 3). Due to the limited number of studies included in the analysis, a multivariable meta-regression could not be performed.DiscussionThe present meta-analysis included 10 high-quality clinical studies, comprising 38,518 participants and 14,473 NAFLD cases. TyG-WC levels were significantly higher in patients with NAFLD compared with the controls (MD: 137.41, 95% CI: 121.52-153.31, P < 0.00001). Subgroup analysis indicated that the association between the TyG-WC level and the subsequent incidence of NAFLD was not significantly affected by the factors, including participants’ geographical regions, age, or BMI. Populations in non-Asian countries, primarily the United States, have higher TyG-WC levels, requiring greater attention to the risks of NAFLD and metabolic syndrome. Future research should further explore the impact of TyG-WC across different racial and socioeconomic backgrounds to develop more targeted interventions. The increased risk of NAFLD reflects the exacerbation of various health concerns, including the progression of liver disease and the occurrence of other complications. The pathogenesis of NAFLD is multifactorial, involving IR, genetic predisposition, gut dysbiosis, and dietary habits. The PNPLA3 variant has been identified as the primary genetic determinant of NAFLD, while variants in TM6SF2, MBOAT7, and GCKR also contribute significantly, albeit with moderate effect sizes [28]. Altered gut microbiota in abundance and diversity can influence NAFLD through multiple bacterial metabolites, including bile acids, butyrate, choline, amino acids, ethanol, lipopolysaccharides (LPS), and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) [29, 30]. Recent findings suggest that modulating these microbial interactions may help slow disease progression. Administration of prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics as gut microbiota therapies in NAFLD patients exerts beneficial effects on HOMA-IR and fasting insulin (FI) levels [31] and can significantly reduce BMI [32]. Meanwhile, prebiotics and probiotics demonstrate a significant overall effect on lowering TNF-α and CRP levels in NAFLD patients [33]. Notably, IR, a core factor in the pathogenesis of NAFLD [34, 35], is characterized by the reduced insulin sensitivity throughout the body, particularly in the liver and adipose tissue [36]. This reduction in insulin sensitivity impairs its ability to facilitate glucose utilization, which subsequently triggers de novo lipogenesis (DNL) and gluconeogenesis in the liver, resulting in excessive fat accumulation in the organ [24, 37]. In the development of IR, two main components of TyG-WC (TG and FPG) are associated with “glucotoxicity”and “lipotoxicity”, playing pivotal roles [38, 39]. Moreover, WC is a key indicator for assessing obesity and potential atherogenic metabolic disturbances [40], is also linked to an increased risk of IR [41]. Notably, IR significantly influences the onset and progression of NAFLD by disrupting glucose and lipid metabolism, as well as promoting excessive fat accumulation in hepatocytes. This reciprocal relationship between IR and hepatocellular fat storage establishes a detrimental cycle that constantly promotes the development and progression of NAFLD [34, 42] (Fig. 6). TyG-WC is derived by multiplying two indicators associated with the IR. Therefore, TyG-WC can be a risk factor for NAFLD. A previous meta-analysis reported a significant association between the risk of NAFLD and TyG-WC level in the Japanese population, specifically when the TyG-WC level was between 480 and 800. It was also demonstrated that TyG-WC level was not associated with the risk of NAFLD when TyG-WC level was ≤ 480 or ≥ 800 [43]. While previous studies have primarily concentrated on TyG-WC level in NAFLD, the present study distinguished between NAFLD and non-NAFLD cases, incorporating data from populations across four countries. Given the unclear relationship between TyG-WC level and the risk of NAFLD, this indicator was selected for comprehensive retrieval and discussion.\nFig. 6TyG-WC Index in NAFLD Progression\nOne previous Nigerian study assessed the utility of novel indices, including the TyG index, TyG-WC, TyG-BMI, and TyG-WHtR, to evaluate their efficacy as predictors of metabolic syndrome (MetS). The mentioned study found that all these indices significantly identified MetS among participants [44]. Notably, several studies have demonstrated that TyG-WC exhibits superior diagnostic performance than HOMA-IR, TyG, and TyG-BMI in diagnosing NAFLD [21, 24, 45]. The most likely explanation for this phenomenon is that BMI serves as a recognized indicator of general obesity, while WC reflects visceral fat accumulation, which is associated with IR, metabolic disorders, and hepatic steatosis [46]. Moreover, the index reflects the correlation between IR and visceral fat [45]. Visceral fat buildup plays a mediating role in obesity-induced liver fat accumulation, this mediation effect is more pronounced in overweight and obese women, accounting for 53.85% of liver fat accumulation, compared to 26.51% in men [47]. So far, there is no universally accepted TyG-WC cutoff value for clinical practice, a cutoff of 637.8369 has been reported in a Japanese population [17], while a cutoff of 790.927 has been reported in an American population [21], and further research is needed to validate these values. Additionally, studies suggested that TyG-WC indices exhibited strong relationships with all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and diabetes mortality among patients with NAFLD [19, 48–50]. Therefore, TyG-WC may serve as a predictive index capable of identifying high-risk patients, allowing for timely and appropriate interventions. This has significant clinical implications for preventing the occurrence and development of NAFLD.The combined results remained consistent with the original findings when any study was omitted from the sensitivity analysis. Similarly, the application of the fixed-effects model for analysis yielded results that were not significantly altered. Both Begg’s test (P = 0.592) and Egger’s test (P = 0.526) demonstrated an absence of publication bias. This study systematically synthesized research from the past five years on the association between TyG-WC and the risk of NAFLD.Nonetheless, several limitations warrant consideration. Firstly, as the diagnosis of NAFLD was confirmed through ultrasonography rather than liver biopsy, the prevalence of NAFLD might be underestimated. Secondly, a substantial proportion of participants were predominantly recruited from three countries: Iran, China, and the United States, potentially limiting the generalizability of the findings. Although we performed univariate meta-regression analysis, residual confounding may still affect our results. In particular, the TyG-WC index in individuals with hyperglycemia or hyperlipidemia may be influenced by pharmacological interventions. Furthermore, due to the limited number of included studies, we were unable to impose restrictions on dietary habits and lifestyle factors, which may contribute to additional heterogeneity. More studies focusing on populations with different characteristics are needed in the future.ConclusionsIn conclusion, our findings demonstrate a significant difference in the TyG-WC index between individuals with NAFLD and those without. This suggests that elevated TyG-WC levels may act as a potential risk factor for NAFLD. Early identification of high-risk individuals using TyG-WC could facilitate timely recognition and intervention, emphasizing the need for close monitoring and targeted dietary modifications in those with elevated levels. Nevertheless, further research is warranted due to the limited available data on the relationship between TyG-WC, liver fibrosis, and diabetic NAFLD, as well as the absence of a definitive diagnostic cut-off for TyG-WC. These future investigations could advance our understanding of the role of TyG-WC in disease onset, progression, and management, ultimately enhancing early diagnosis, clinical decision-making, and personalized treatment strategies for NAFLD.Electronic supplementary materialBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material.\nSupplementary Material 1"}

However, their effect on arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death (SCD) is not well established.ObjectivesThe authors sought to evaluate the association between SGLT2i and the risk of arrhythmias and SCD in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, HF, or chronic kidney disease.MethodsWe performed a systematic literature search on PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus for relevant randomized controlled trials from inception until February 10, 2023. ORs and 95% CIs were pooled using a random effect model.ResultsA total of 38 randomized controlled trials with 88,704 patients (48,435 in the SGLT2i group and 40,269 in the control group) were included in the study. The mean age of patients among SGLT2i and control groups was 56.8 and 56.7 years, respectively. The mean follow-up duration was 1.6 years. Pooled analysis of primary and secondary outcomes showed that SGLT2i significantly reduced the risk of incident atrial arrhythmia (OR: 0.85 [95% CI: 0.75-0.98], P = 0.02), SCD (OR: 0.72 [95% CI: 0.55-0.94], P = 0.02) compared with placebo. However, the risk of ventricular arrhythmia (OR: 1.03 [95% CI: 0.84-1.26], P = 0.77) and cardiac arrest (OR: 0.94 [95% CI: 0.72-1.23] P = 0.67) was comparable between both groups of patients.ConclusionsSGLT2i therapy was associated with an overall lower risk of atrial arrythmia and SCD in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and/or HF or chronic kidney disease. However, SGLT2i therapy was not associated with a lower risk of ventricular arrhythmia.", "body": "Cardiovascular events, including atrial and ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (SCD), are more common in those affected by diabetes mellitus (DM).1,2 Long-term effects of type 2 DM (T2DM) can also contribute to heart failure (HF) and coronary artery disease that predispose to SCD.3 Cardiovascular risk factor control was found to contribute significantly to decreasing mortality rates in men and women with DM.1 Despite these interventions, SCD was reported to be twice as common in persons with DM and nearly 6 to 9 times more common in persons with HF compared to the general population. The leading cause of SCD in these patients was noted to be related to ventricular arrhythmias (VAs).4,5 Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is also a risk factor for SCD with the rate of death increasing proportionately to the stage of CKD. A recent report also suggested that in hemodialysis units, SCD occurs in 7 per 100,000 hemodialysis sessions. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have recently been approved for their use in slowing the progression of CKD and also reducing cardiovascular mortality in patients with CKD.6Recent trials studying the effect of SGLT2i in patients with T2DM, HF, and/or CKD have shown promising results in decreasing HF hospitalizations, cardiovascular death, and all-cause mortality.7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 Clinical and experimental studies have suggested this to be largely attributed to SGLT2i’s properties of modulating ventricular remodeling, decreasing sympathetic activity, decreasing oxidative stress and inflammation, and improving renal function.15 With new evidence from the recent study of EMPA Kidney (Heart and Kidney Protection with Empagliflozin, 2023), EMPEROR-Reduced (Empagliflozin Outcome Trial in Patients with Chronic Heart Failure and a Reduced Ejection Fraction, 2020), DAPA-CKD (Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Chronic Kidney Disease, 2020), DELIVER (Dapagliflozin Evaluation to Improve the Lives of Patients with Preserved Ejection Fraction Heart Failure, 2022), and EMPEROR-Preserved (Empagliflozin Outcome Trial in Patients with Chronic Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction, 2021), we aimed to re-evaluate the effect of SGLT2i in preventing SCD and arrhythmias in patients with T2DM, HF, and/or CKD.11,16, 17, 18, 19 We therefore conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from inception to date to examine the association between SGLTi’s treatment and the incidence of SCD and arrhythmias.MethodsThis meta-analysis was conducted and reported following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis) 2020 guidelines and performed according to established methods, as described previously.20, 21, 22, 23 The prespecified study protocol was registered in the PROSPERO (CRD42023437142).Search strategyWe conducted a systematic literature search in PubMed, Embase, and ClinicalTrial.gov using predefined MESH terms by using “AND” and “OR.” The following search terms were used: “Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter-2 Inhibitor” OR “SGLT2i” AND “Heart failure” OR “HFrEF” OR “HFpEF” AND “Diabetes Mellitus\" OR “T2DM” AND “Chronic Kidney Disease” OR “CKD” AND “Sudden Cardiac Death” AND “Arrhythmias” OR “Atrial Fibrillation” OR “Atrial Flutter” OR Ventricular Fibrillation” OR “Ventricular Fibrillation” OR “Ventricular Arrhythmia.” We queried databases from their search inception up until February 10, 2023, without any restrictions on the language of the studies. Search strategies are listed in Supplemental Table 1.All the studies were carefully screened and exported to the Mendeley reference manager used to handle searched citations. A manual check was carried through to cross-check for any remaining duplicates. Two reviewers (V.J. and N.D.) reviewed the papers based on the title and abstract. Discrepancies regarding the inclusion of studies were arbitrated by another author (A.J.).Eligibility criteriaWe included studies with adult patients ≥18 years of age. All RCTs were eligible if they included patients with T2DM and/or HF or CKD. It was decided to include studies with 2 arms in one with SGLT2i as an intervention, and placebo or control as a comparator. Studies must have reported outcomes of interest (primary and secondary outcomes). Selected studies compared patients with varying baseline characteristics and pathologies.Studies that were performed on animals, or reviews, case reports, case series, studies on patients <18 years, studies with a single arm or without SGLT2i as an intervention, studies with sotagliflozin (a dual sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 and 1 inhibitor) as an intervention, and studies without outcomes of interest were excluded from the review.Clinical outcomesThe primary outcome of this meta-analysis was atrial arrhythmia (which includes atrial fibrillation and flutter). Secondary outcomes included VA (which includes ventricular fibrillation, ventricular flutter, and ventricular tachycardia), SCD, and cardiac arrest.Data extraction and quality assessmentTwo authors (N.D. and V.J.) extracted the following data: study type, author, study location, study follow-up duration, patient characteristics (number, age, sex, and comorbidities), and primary and secondary outcomes. Two investigators (D.H. and V.J.) independently appraised the potential risk of bias using version 2 of the Cochrane risk of bias tool for RCTs.24 We then classified studies as low, moderate, or high quality after the evaluation.Statistical analysisBaseline continuous variables were summarized in mean ± SD, whereas dichotomous variables were described in frequency or percentage. We performed a conventional meta-analysis for primary and secondary outcomes and adopted the DerSimonian and Laird random effect model for the study variations.25 For studies with zero-events in either treatment of control groups, a continuity correction (0.5) was applied to each cells. Outcomes were reported as pooled OR, and their corresponding 95% CI. Statistical significance was met if the 95% CI did not cross the numeric “1” and the 2-tailed P value was <0.05. We considered a 2-tailed P value of <0.05 to be statistically significant. The heterogeneity among studies was assessed by Higgins's I-squared (I2) statistical model with I2 values. As a guide, I2 <25% indicated low, 25% to 50% moderate, and >50% high heterogeneity.26 Further sensitivity analyses were performed using a leave-one-out method to check the robustness of the results. Subgroup analyses were implemented to explore the causes of heterogeneity of primary and secondary outcomes based on type of SGLT2i and follow-up period. Assessment of publication bias was via visualization of the funnel plot.27 All statistical work, inclusive analysis, and graphical illustrations were conducted using STATA (version 17.0, StataCorp).28ResultsBaseline characteristics of patients in included studiesThe initial search strategy yielded 1,824 articles, of which 594 duplicates were removed, and 1,168 articles were excluded after the title and abstract screening. The full-text review was performed on the remaining 62 studies, after which 24 studies were excluded from the final review and analysis for the following reasons: lack of appropriate comparison arm, review articles, lack of follow-up data, or lack of outcome of interest (Figure 1).Figure 1Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Flow Diagram of Search Among Different DatabasesIn summary, 38 studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in the final analysis. All of them were RCTs, of which dapagliflozin was used as an intervention in 13 studies,7,9,16,17,29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37 canagliflozin in 10 studies,8,38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45 empagliflozin in 11 studies,11,18,19,46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53 and ertugliflozin in 4 studies.54, 55, 56, 57 The total number of patients was 88,704, with 48,435 patients in the SGLT2i group and 40,269 in the control group. The mean age of patients among SGLT2i and control groups was 56.8 and 56.7 years, and the number of males in SGLT2i and control groups was 58.8% and 41.2%, respectively. The mean follow-up duration was 1.6 years. The study characteristics, patients’ demographics, and comorbidities are presented in Table 1. The quality assessment using Cochrane risk of bias showed that there was a low risk of bias across all included studies (Supplemental Figure 1).Table 1Baseline Demographics, Comorbidities, and Study Characteristics of Studies Included in the Meta-AnalysisStudy/First Author, YearDrug UsedDose (mg)Sample SizeTotal Sample SizeAge, yMaleDMCKDHFFollow-Up (y)DELIVER, 2022Dapagliflozin103,1316,26371.81,7671,401--2.3Placebo3,13271.51,7491,405--EMPEROR PreservedEmpagliflozin102,9915,98871.81,6591,466-2,9962.18Placebo2,99771.91,6531,472-2,991EMPA-KIDNEY, 2023Empagliflozin103,3046,60963.42,207---2Placebo3,30563.32,210---EMPA-TROPISM, 2021Empagliflozin10408064.227--400.5Placebo4059.927--40EMPEROR-REDUCEDEmpagliflozin101,8633,72666.51,411---3Placebo1,86366.51,426---Bailey, 2013Dapagliflozin2.5/5/1040954653.9216---2Placebo13753.776---CANTATA-D, 2013Canagliflozin100/3007351,10155.4339---0.5Placebo36655.5172---CANTATA-MSU, 2013Canagliflozin100/30031346956.7239---1Placebo15656.876---CANTATA-SU, 2013Canagliflozin50/100/200/3009681,42056.2493---0.2Placebo45256.3263---CANVAS, 2017Canagliflozin100/3002,8884,32963.23,759---5.7Placebo1,44162.3956---CANVAS-R, 2017Canagliflozin100/3002,9045,80763.91,854---2Placebo2,903641,794Cefalu, 2015Dapagliflozin1046092262.8316---1Placebo46263316---CREDENCE, 2019Canagliflozin1002,2004,397632,907---2.6Placebo2,19763.21,467---DAPA-CKD, 2020Dapagliflozin102,1494,29861.81,4431,455-2352.4Placebo2,14961.91,4361,451-233DAPA-HF, 2019Dapagliflozin102,3684,73666.21,8049939621,1241.5Placebo2,36866.51,8239909641,127DECLARE-TIMI 58, 2018Dapagliflozin108,57417,14363.93,591--8524.2Placebo8,569643,596--872CANTATA D2, 2013Canagliflozin30037775556.5207---2Placebo37856.6215---DURATION-8, 2016Dapagliflozin1023146154.15110---0.5Placebo23054116---EMPA-HEART CardioLink6, 2019Empagliflozin1049976444-020.5Placebo486446-24EMPA-REG, 2015Empagliflozin10/254,6877,02063.15,016-607-3.1Placebo2,33363.21,680-605-EMPA-REG BASALTM, 2015Empagliflozin10/2532449459.25186---1.5Placebo17058.180---EMPA-REG H2H-SU, 2018Empagliflozin257671,54756.2432---4Placebo78055.7421---EMPA-REG PIO, 2015Empagliflozin10/2533349854.5168---0.5Placebo16554.673---EMPA-REG RENAL, 2014Empagliflozin10/2541973862.6249---1Placebo31964.1181---Ferrannini, 2010Dapagliflozin2.5/5/1041048552.6198---2Placebo7552.731---Januzzi, 2017Canagliflozin100/30045066664248---2Placebo21663.2133---Leiter, 2014Dapagliflozin1048296563.8321--860.5Placebo48363.6323--66Mathieu, 2015Dapagliflozin1016032055.1146---1Placebo1605576---Muller-Wieland, 2018Dapagliflozin1031262557.4202---1Placebo31358.6206---Nauck, 2013Dapagliflozin2.5/5/1040681458221---1Placebo40859220---Rosenstock, 2012Canagliflozin50/100/200/30032138653.08167---1Placebo6553.331---Rosenstock, 2016Canagliflozin100/30047571254.7230---0.5Placebo23755.2116---Softeland, 2017Empagliflozin10/2522233255.2137332166-0.5Placebo11055.960VERTIS FACTORIAL, 2018Ertugliflozin5/1549874555.2261---1Placebo24754.8153---VERTIS MET, 2018Ertugliflozin5/1541262156.7190---2Placebo20956.598---VERTIS RENAL, 2018Ertugliflozin5/1531346767.3231---1Placebo15467.572---Wilding, 2012Dapagliflozin2.5/561080759.3287---0.5Placebo19758.598---VERTIS SU, 2018Ertugliflozin5/158801,31558.5470---0.5Placebo43557.8213---CKD = chronic kidney disease; DM = diabetes mellitus; HF = heart failure.Meta-analysis on primary and secondary outcomesAmong the primary outcomes, pooled analysis of 38 trials showed that SGLT2i was associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of atrial arrhythmia (OR: 0.85 [95% CI: 0.75-0.98], P = 0.02, I2 = 6.08%) compared with the control group with minimal heterogeneity across studies (Figure 2A). Nevertheless, there was no significant association between SGLT2i and the incidence of VAs (OR: 1.03 [95% CI: 0.84-1.26], P = 0.77, I2 = 0) with minimal heterogeneity observed (Figure 2B).Figure 2Forest Plots of Primary Outcomes Including Atrial and Ventricular ArrhythmiasForest plots of primary outcomes including (A) atrial arrhythmia, (B) ventricular arrhythmia. SGLT2i = sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors.In terms of secondary outcomes, SGLT2i was associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of SCD (OR: 0.72 [95% CI: 0.55-0.94], P = 0.02, I2 = 0) compared to the control group (Figure 3A). However, there was no significant association between SGLT2i and the incidence of cardiac arrest (OR: 0.94 [95% CI: 0.72-1.23], P = 0.67, I2 = 0) (Figure 3B).Figure 3Forest Plots of Secondary Outcomes Including Sudden Cardiac Death and Cardiac ArrestForest plots of secondary outcomes including (A) sudden cardiac death, (B) cardiac arrest. Abbreviation as in Figure 2.Meta-analysis based on components of atrial arrhythmias and ventricular arrhythmiasThe pooled analysis shows that SGLT2i significantly reduced the incidence of atrial fibrillation (OR: 0.87 [95% CI: 0.76-0.98], P = 0.03, I2 = 0%), but not atrial flutter (OR: 0.83 [95% CI: 0.60-1.15], P = 0.27, I2 = 6.60%) compared with the control group (Supplemental Figures 2A and 2B). However, the risk of incidence of ventricular fibrillation (OR: 1.12 [95% CI: 0.73-1.70], P = 0.60, I2 = 0%), ventricular flutter (OR: 0.83 [95% CI: 0.20-3.39], P = 0.80), I2 = 0%), and ventricular tachycardia (OR: 1.00 [95% CI: 0.77-1.29], P = 0.98, I2 = 8.76%) was comparable between both the groups of patients (Supplementary Figures 3A to 3C).Subgroup analysisSubgroup analyses were performed on primary and secondary outcomes based on the type of SGLT2i used. For atrial arrhythmias, there were no significant differences (P = 0.98) based on the type of SGLT2i used including canagliflozin (OR: 0.81 [95% CI: 0.60-1.09]), dapagliflozin (OR: 0.81 [95% CI: 0.61-1.11]), empagliflozin (OR: 0.85 [95% CI: 0.60-1.21]), and ertugliflozin (OR: 1.12 [95% CI: 0.23-5.39]) (Supplemental Figure 4).In addition, there were no significant differences observed for the incidence of VA based on the types of SGLT2i including canagliflozin (OR: 0.95 [95% CI: 0.44-2.06]), dapagliflozin (OR: 0.85 [95% CI: 0.69-1.21]), and empagliflozin (OR: 1.11 [95% CI: 0.75-1.64]) with no significant subgroup difference (P = 0.68) (Supplemental Figure 5). After stratification by type of SGLT2i used, there were no significant differences in the incidence of SCD and cardiac arrest (Supplemental Figures 6 and 7).We stratified the studies into subgroups of follow-up period of less than or equal to 1 year and more than 1 year, respectively. Overall, there was no significant difference between these subgroups based on follow-up period on the primary and secondary outcomes including atrial arrhythmia, cardiac arrest, SCD, sudden death, and ventricular fibrillation (Supplemental Figures 8 to 11).Sensitivity analyses and publication biasSensitivity analyses were carried out to test the robustness of the primary analysis. After leave-one-out analysis, the results of meta-analysis on the incidence of atrial arrhythmia remained largely unchanged and statistically significant, except when excluding DECLARE-TIMI 2018 and EMPEROR-REDUCED, where results became marginally insignificant (Supplemental Figure 12). Similarly for SCD, results were marginally insignificant after removal of study by DELIVER 2022 (Supplemental Figure 13). Otherwise, results of cardiac arrest and VA remained consistent with primary analysis, confirming the robustness of statistical analysis (Supplemental Figures 14 and 15).A separate analysis has been performed by removing zero events from the primary and secondary outcomes. It was found that risk of atrial arrhythmia became nonsignificant, although showing a trend of nonsignificant reduction among SGLT2i. However, the risk of SCD, cardiac arrest, and VA remained consistent with primary analysis (Supplemental Figures 16 to 19).Assessment of publication bias through funnel plot visualization showed that there was no evidence of publication bias, with minimal or no funnel plot asymmetry observed for all the outcomes (Supplemental Figures 20 to 23).DiscussionThe present meta-analysis of 38 RCTs involving 88,704 patients shows that SGLT2i significantly lowered the risk of incident atrial arrhythmia and SCD (Central Illustration). Specifically, we observed that SGLT2i reduced the risk of atrial fibrillation. Additionally, no significant association was found between SGLT2i and the incidence of VAs, and cardiac arrest. The risk of ventricular fibrillation, ventricular flutter, and ventricular tachycardia was comparable between both groups of patients. These findings lend further evidence that SGLT2i therapy can provide clinically relevant risk reductions in atrial arrhythmias and SCD.Central IllustrationSodium-Glucose Cotransporter-2 Inhibitors and Arrhythmias: A Meta-Analysis of 38 Randomized Controlled TrialsAbbreviation as in Figure 2.A meta-analysis by Sfairopoulos et al58 in 2021 suggested that SGLT2i therapy was not associated with a lower risk of SCD or VAs in patients with T2DM and/or HF and/or CKD. Since the previous meta-analysis in 2021, new data became available from landmark RCTs published such as DELIVER, EMPEROR PRESERVED, DAPA-CKD, and EMPEROR-REDUCED. Our meta-analysis incorporates a substantial body of new evidence derived from these rigorously conducted RCTs. In contrast, our study reported that SGLT2i therapy was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of SCD in patients with T2DM and/or HF. Another meta-analysis by Oates et al,59 2023 reported that their analysis did not demonstrate a reduction in the incidence of arrhythmic events (including both atrial arrhythmias and VAs) in patients receiving SGLT2i therapy. Our study shows a significant reduction in the incidence of atrial arrhythmias in patients receiving SGLT2i therapy. Our primary research findings, after including DAPA-CKD,16 DELIVER,17 and EMPEROR-Preserved18 trials, are consistent with the meta-analysis by Fernandes et al,60 as both report a lower incidence of atrial arrhythmias and SCD when treated with SGLT2i, indicating the robustness of our results. Health care professionals and policymakers may be more inclined to consider the findings from the study when making decisions about the use of SGLT2i in patients with T2DM, HF, and/or CKD. It also provides additional insights into the effectiveness of different types of SGLT2i in patient populations with T2DM or HF.These favorable effects of SGLT2i on atrial arrhythmias and SCD may be ascribed to the SGLT2i's capacity to impact ventricular remodeling, diminish sympathetic activity, mitigate oxidative stress and inflammation, and enhance renal function.15 Increased susceptibility to arrhythmias is commonly exacerbated by cardiac remodeling, hypertrophy, and dysfunction caused by fibrosis. SGLT2i offer indirect protection against arrhythmias by mitigating the risk of atrial fibrillation and preserving myocardial function.61 SGLT2i have been found to exert a positive impact on the activity of phospholamban, leading to the phosphorylation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and consequent modulation of sarcoplasmic calcium release. As a result, these inhibitors effectively mitigate calcium overload, thereby reducing the incidence of arrhythmias.62 Additionally, SGLT2i are potent late INa inhibitors and are highly selective for late INa, signifying that SGLT2i could markedly decrease the risk of arrhythmias.63SGLT2i have been widely acknowledged for their cardioprotective properties, which can be attributed to a range of interconnected pathways that may collectively reduce the risk of SCD.64 These pathways involve multiple mechanisms: firstly, the induction of hemodynamic effects leading to plasma volume contraction and subsequent blood pressure reduction, which effectively lessens both preload and afterload on the heart.65, 66, 67 Secondly, the inhibition of sodium-hydrogen exchange within myocardial cells has been associated with mitigating myocardial hypertrophy, fibrosis, adverse remodeling, systolic dysfunction, and HF.65, 66, 67 Lastly, there is the potential for suppressing the sympathetic nervous system, adding to the overall cardioprotective impact of SGLT2i.67,68 Altogether, these intricate mechanisms underscore the considerable cardioprotective benefits of SGLT2i, offering a promising avenue for decreasing the incidence of SCD.Our study showed that the use of SGLT2i did not result in a significant difference in the incidence of VAs. This may be due to a small number of studies; hence, reflecting a lack of power rather than a lack of effect. It has been established that left ventricular volumes, both end-diastolic and end-systolic, serve as surrogate indicators for unfavorable ventricular remodeling in HF, showing a strong correlation with the efficacy of specific drug or device therapies on patient survival.69 Furthermore, RCTs on mortality suggest a higher likelihood of neutral or favorable effects with increasing mean left ventricular ejection fraction.70 As a result, it is reasonable to speculate that the impact of SGLT2i therapy on left ventricular end-diastolic volume and left ventricular ejection fraction may not be substantial. Consequently, its potential as an anti-arrhythmic agent for VAs might be relatively modest overall. Nevertheless, further rigorously designed clinical studies with ample statistical power and extended follow-up periods are imperative to draw definitive conclusions regarding the potential reduction of VA incidence by SGLT2is.The generalizability of our findings is strengthened by the inclusion of data from 38 RCTs, encompassing a diverse population of men and women with diabetes, CKD, or HF. While males comprised a larger proportion of participants across most trials, a substantial number of females were also included, ensuring the applicability of results to both sexes. However, younger individuals, older adults over 80 years, and patients from low-resource settings remain underrepresented, which may limit generalizability to these groups. The consistent dosing regimens and representation of various SGLT2 inhibitors enhance applicability across clinical contexts, but variability in follow-up durations and limited data on patients with complex comorbidities suggest caution when extrapolating to populations with chronic or multifaceted medical conditions. Further research should aim to include underrepresented groups and focus on long-term outcomes to ensure broader applicability of the findings.StrengthThis meta-analysis, encompassing 38 RCTs, offers a robust and comprehensive evaluation of the relationship between SGLT2i and the incidence of arrhythmias, providing a depth of insight beyond that of individual studies. The implementation of rigorous methodology and analysis including sensitivity, subgroup analyses, and evaluation of potential publication bias ensured a systematic assessment of available data and thus enhancing the reliability of our findings.Study LimitationsNevertheless, several limitations should be kept in mind upon interpretations of our findings. The included RCTs have varying study design, patient population, and endpoints. Therefore, the pooled results may be influenced by this inherent heterogeneity. Furthermore, with a median follow-up period of 1 year, it may not be sufficient to capture potentially delayed effects of SGLT2i, thus may underestimate the benefits of SGLT2i. Furthermore, these RCTs were designed with adequate power to detect differences in their primary endpoints, which means secondary or tertiary endpoints, including the ones of our interest, might not have been sufficiently powered. While meta-analysis can enhance the statistical power by pooling data across studies, the absence of specific outcomes of interest in individual studies still limits the overall power for particular endpoints such as SCD and cardiac arrest. Lastly, the low-event rate observed in certain endpoints may introduce challenge in deriving a reasonable inference. Due to the presence of studies with zero events, we applied continuity correction to facilitate the analysis. It is worth noting that such method allowed the inclusion of more studies but may introduce bias, thus may underestimate or overestimate the true effect size.ConclusionsSGLT2i therapy was associated with an overall lower risk of atrial arrhythmia and SCD in patients with T2DM and/or HF or CKD. However, it was not associated with lower risk of VA. Further adequately powered randomized trials are needed with more diverse participants and longer follow-ups to validate these effects of SGLT2i among T2DM and/or HF patients.Funding support and author disclosuresDr Fonarow has consulted for Abbott, Amgen, AstraZeneca, Bayer, Boehringer Ingelheim, Cytokinetics, Eli Lilly, Johnson & Johnson, Medtronic, Merck, Novartis, and Pfizer.

It highlights the efficacy and comparative benefits of HAIC in improving treatment outcomes and emphasizes its potential as a targeted therapeutic option in clinical practice.TO THE EDITORThe study of Zhou et al[1] published in the World Journal of Gastrointestinal Oncology presents a comprehensive network meta-analysis evaluating the efficacy of hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) and its combination therapies for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCC often presents in an advanced stage for which treatment options are limited, rendering treatment challenging. HAIC delivers potent anticancer agents directly to the tumor through the hepatic artery. The meta-analysis of Zhou et al[1] compares the effectiveness and safety of HAIC alone and in combination with other treatments. This study contextualizes the findings, explores their clinical implications, and discusses strategies for optimizing therapeutic approaches for managing advanced HCC. Studies such as that of Zuo et al[2] have highlighted the potential of combining HAIC with immune checkpoint inhibitors and antiangiogenic agents such as camrelizumab and apatinib to improve outcomes and survival in patients with advanced HCC. Mei et al[3] introduced the Assessment for Retreatment with HAIC (ARH) score as a tool to guide retreatment decisions on the basis of treatment response and disease progression. Moreover, Wang et al[4] examined the effects of a combination of programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) inhibitors, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), and HAIC as a first-line treatment of advanced HCC associated with the hepatitis B virus (HBV), and they obtained promising tumor control and survival results. These studies illustrate the ongoing efforts to enhance therapeutic outcomes through innovative combinations and personalized treatment strategies tailored to the clinical profiles of patients with advanced HCC. In summary, the meta-analysis of Zhou et al[1] and recent advancements in combination therapies offer critical insights into the evolving role of HAIC in treating advanced HCC. This study provides clinicians with perspectives on current practices and to guide research and improve outcomes for patients who have received a diagnosis of this challenging condition.Evolution of HAICHAIC was developed as a targeted treatment for HCC that utilizes the liver’s unique vascular anatomy to deliver concentrated chemotherapy drugs directly to tumor sites, reducing systemic exposure and related toxicities[1]. This approach addresses the challenge of the liver’s dual blood supply by enabling selective delivery of therapeutic agents through the hepatic artery, which primarily supplies HCC tumors. Advancements in HAIC have been driven by a deep understanding of HCC’s pathophysiology and the need for localized treatment strategies involving high drug efficacy and small adverse effects. The network meta-analysis of Zhou et al[1] illustrates the comparative effectiveness of HAIC across therapeutic regimens, emphasizing the role of the treatment in improving survival and tumor response rates in patients with advanced HCC. Furthermore, recent studies have explored combination therapies aiming to enhance the efficacy of HAIC. For example, synergistic effects were found when HAIC was combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors such as camrelizumab and targeted therapies such as apatinib; antitumor immune responses were enhanced, and progression-free survival was extended[2]. Mei et al[3] emphasized the importance of personalizing treatment on the basis of a patient’s response and disease progression. HAIC is thus a pivotal advancement in the management of HCC that enables tailored therapeutic approaches, maximizing efficacy and minimizing systemic toxicity. Researchers continue to refine HAIC protocols and explore new combinations to optimize outcomes for patients with advanced HCC.Comparative effectiveness of HAIC and combination therapiesThe network meta-analysis of Zhou et al[1] provides a comprehensive evaluation of HAIC alone and in combination with various therapeutic agents or modalities for advanced HCC. The meta-analysis provides a comparative assessment of outcomes such as tumor response rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival. Additionally, the meta-analysis indicates the efficacy of HAIC in delivering targeted therapy directly to liver tumors, using the liver’s vascular anatomy to achieve high local drug concentrations and to minimize systemic toxicity. Zhou et al[1] employed a frequentist approach to compare the efficacy and safety of HAIC and its combination strategies for treating advanced HCC. This method estimates treatment effects by integrating direct and indirect evidence from multiple studies, enhancing the robustness of the comparative outcomes[1]. Zhou et al[1] used hazard ratios (HRs) and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals to evaluate overall survival, progression-free survival, the tumor response rate, and adverse events. HRs and ORs provide standardized measures of effect size across studies, enabling comparison of treatments with varying baseline characteristics[1]. Additionally, the P-score, which ranks treatments on the basis of the probability they are the best option, was calculated to provide a detailed interpretation of the relative efficacy of various therapeutic combinations[1]. Use of the P-score enabled the inclusion of studies that did not directly compare all treatments but contributed valuable indirect comparisons. This approach is particularly relevant for HAIC, for which direct head-to-head trials are lacking. Combining direct and indirect evidence addresses gaps in the literature to provide a comprehensive understanding of the benefits and risks associated with various HAIC strategies[1]. This article references studies that have employed similar or complementary statistical methods, emphasizing the importance of robust analysis in advancing treatment strategies for HCC. For example, Zuo et al[2] employed a similar approach to demonstrate the effectiveness of the combination of HAIC, camrelizumab, and apatinib, validating the findings of Zhou et al[1] and highlighting the ability of innovative combination therapies to improve patient outcome. By highlighting the incorporation of detailed statistical methods in the meta-analysis of Zhou et al[1], this article underscores the reliability of network meta-analyses in guiding clinical decisions to advance HCC treatment. The methodological rigor of these studies supports this article’s conclusions and suggests directions for future research and clinical practice[1]. Zhou et al[1] further discussed the synergistic benefits of combining HAIC with therapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (camrelizumab) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitors (apatinib) that exhibit enhanced antitumor activity and provide long-term disease control in patients with advanced HCC[2,4]. Their findings underscore the focus of research on treating HCC with combination therapies involving HAIC to improve outcomes and patient survival.Safety and tolerability profilesAssessing the safety and tolerability of therapeutic regimens is integral to treating HCC. The network meta-analysis of Zhou et al[1] provides insights into the safety of HAIC and its combination therapies for advanced HCC. The meta-analysis highlights safety concerns such as hematological and hepatic toxicities and other treatment-related adverse events[1]. For example, when combined with an immunotherapy agent such as camrelizumab and targeted therapy such as apatinib, HAIC has manageable toxicity if a patient is carefully monitored[2]. Additionally, the retrospective study of Wang et al[4] highlights the balance that must be struck between efficacy and safety, particularly when integrating immune checkpoint inhibitors and TKIs with HAIC to treat advanced HCC associated with HBV. Managing treatment-related adverse effects is essential to optimizing outcomes and ensuring the feasibility of HAIC-based therapies for advanced HCC.Clinical implications and future directionsThe meta-analysis of Zhou et al[1] can inform clinical decision-making and shape research into HCC treatment strategies. Integrating these strategies into clinical practice can enhance outcomes for patients with advanced HCC. For example, combining HAIC with camrelizumab and apatinib may improve the efficacy and tolerability or HAIC[2]. Mei et al[3] emphasized the importance of personalized treatment approaches, suggesting the use of tools such as the ARH score to optimize retreatment decisions and manage adverse events. Future research must identify predictive biomarkers with which patient populations receiving tailored treatments can be identified. Additional research is required to develop combination therapies that minimize toxicity and maximize efficacy[4]. However, acknowledging gaps and challenges in the study of Zhou et al[1] is essential in examining the limitations of evidence regarding the efficacy of HAIC and its combination therapies. One major limitation is the heterogeneity among studies in the network meta-analysis; variations in design, patient populations, and treatment regimens may have affected the generalizability of the findings. The lack of direct comparisons between therapeutic strategies also complicates the interpretation of the results because indirect comparisons can introduce biases that weaken the conclusions[1]. Another limitation is the inadequate representation of certain combination therapies, particularly those involving novel agents such as immune checkpoint inhibitors. Although HAIC combined with PD-1 inhibitors and TKIs has potential, as noted by Wang et al[4], the retrospective nature of the studies and the absence of large-scale randomized controlled trials (RCTs) raise concerns regarding the robustness of the evidence supporting these combinations[1]. Future research must prioritize well-designed RCTs to validate the efficacy and safety of these novel combinations and establish standardized treatment protocols for broader clinical use. However, the literature does not address long-term outcomes or potential late-onset toxicities associated with HAIC and its combination therapies. Studies such as those of Zuo et al[2] and Mei et al[3] provide insights into short-term efficacy and safety, but more comprehensive studies are required to assess long-term survival, quality of life, and posttreatment complications. Future research must also identify and validate predictive biomarkers to enable personalized treatment approaches tailored to each individual patient’s characteristics. Additionally, decision-making tools, such as the ARH score proposed by Mei et al[3], need to be refined and validated in larger cohorts to enhance their clinical utility[1]. Personalized treatment strategies must consider individual patient factors, specifically liver function, tumor burden, and molecular profiles, when evaluating the appropriateness of HAIC and its combination therapies. Using predictive biomarkers in clinical decision-making can help tailor treatment plans to maximize efficacy and minimize adverse effects[1]. Nevertheless, combining HAIC with modalities such as PD-1 inhibitors or TKIs must be approached cautiously until validated by large-scale RCTs. Clinicians must weigh the benefits against the risks, particularly for patients with compromised liver function or comorbidities[1]. Monitoring patients undergoing HAIC-based therapies in terms of their long-term outcomes and potential late-onset toxicities is critical; regular follow-ups and comprehensive assessments are required to manage adverse effects and ensure sustained therapeutic benefits[1]. Ongoing clinical trials can provide additional evidence regarding the effectiveness of HAIC and its combinations and enable refinement of treatment protocols and improvement of outcomes[1]. Addressing these limitations and incorporating these recommendations can help researchers and clinicians effectively harness HAIC’s potential, improving the prognosis for patients with advanced HCC.CONCLUSIONThe network meta-analysis of Zhou et al[1] considerably advances our understanding of HAIC and its combination therapies for treating advanced HCC. Their findings illustrate HAIC’s potency as a localized treatment that delivers high concentrations of chemotherapy agents directly to liver tumors and thereby minimizes systemic side effects[1]. This study summarizes the results of the meta-analysis, emphasizing the comparative efficacy of HAIC alone and in combination with other therapies. Additionally, this article examines HAIC’s history, mechanistic benefits, and safety profiles highlighted in the analysis. The discussion addresses clinical implications, suggesting methods for optimizing treatment strategies and improving patient outcomes for those with advanced HCC. Future research should refine HAIC protocols, explore novel combinations such as HAIC with immunotherapy and targeted agents (e.g., camrelizumab and apatinib), and identify biomarkers that can enable personalization of treatments[2-4]. These efforts can expand therapeutic options for advanced HCC, improving survival rates and patients’ quality of life. In conclusion, the meta-analysis of Zhou et al[1] provides critical insights for future HCC treatment, validating the role of HAIC in managing this challenging disease."}

We aimed to update a systematic review and conduct a meta-analysis of reconstructed time-to-event data from randomized control trials (RCTs) in low-/intermediate-risk patients.MethodsSystematic searches were performed in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL, and specific websites up to November 2023, for RCTs. A meta-analysis was performed using the reconstructed time-to-event data from the provided Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves from the included RCTs. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, and the secondary outcomes included a composite outcome (all-cause mortality and disabling stroke), and heart failure rehospitalization. Landmark analysis for endpoints beyond 1 year was performed. The study protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42023487893).ResultsSix RCTs with a total of 7,389 patients were included. The survival was comparable between both groups [hazard ratio (HR), 1.03; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.93–1.14; P=0.57]. The composite outcome and heart failure rehospitalization were comparable between the two groups. Lower mortality with TAVR was observed compared to SAVR before 1 year (HR, 0.82; 95% CI: 0.68–0.98; P=0.03), while TAVR was associated with higher risk of mortality beyond 1 year (HR, 1.13; 95% CI: 1.01–1.27; P=0.04). Similarly, the TAVR group was associated with lower risk for the composite endpoint and heart failure rehospitalization before 1 year, but with higher rates beyond 1 year.ConclusionsAmong low- to intermediate-risk patients, TAVR was found to be associated with favorable outcomes in the short-term (0–1 year). However, our landmark analysis demonstrated TAVR to be associated with poorer outcomes beyond 1 year.", "body": "IntroductionTranscatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has become a well-established alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) for severe symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS) (1,2). Although previous randomized control trials (RCTs) have shown comparable overall mortality for high-, intermediate- and low-risk patient groups (1-8), there remains uncertainty regarding long-term data (9,10). With the exception of the Nordic Aortic Valve Intervention (NOTION) trial, the follow-up periods of no RCTs exceed 5 years (8).The efficacy of TAVR for low- and intermediate-risk patients remains to be fully elucidated (9,10), and the most recent data from the Evolut Low Risk Trial and the Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves 3 (PARTNER 3) trial prompted a reevaluation of the current existing literature (6,7). Given the low event rates in low- and intermediate-risk groups, a meta-analysis would mitigate potential underpowering issues. Furthermore, a previous meta-analysis of RCTs revealed a time-varying association between TAVR and SAVR patients, with a higher mid-term mortality rate with the TAVR group (11). Therefore, a meta-analysis of Kaplan-Meier (KM) derived data, accounting for time-varying effects, holds significance in guiding optimal therapy selection during the decision-making process. Herein, we report a meta-analysis of mid-term outcomes comparing SAVR and TAVR for low- and intermediate-risk patients with severe AS.MethodsThis review was reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement standards (12). Given the nature of our study, Institutional Review Board or Informed Written Consent for Publication was not required. The study protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42023487893).Literature search strategyAll RCTs comparing TAVR with SAVR for low- and intermediate-risk patients with symptomatic severe AS were identified using a two-level strategy. First, a search of PubMed (MEDLINE), EMBASE, and Cochrane CENTRAL databases was conducted with an experienced medical librarian to identify all the studies published from database inception to November 8th, 2023, that investigated the comparison of TAVR and SAVR in severe symptomatic AS patients. The detailed retrieval strategies are shown in Tables S1-S3. We also searched websites (www.ClinicalTrials.gov, https://www.acc.org, www.escardio.org, https://tctmd.com) for unpublished data.Eligibility criteriaThe included studies met the following criteria: the study design was an RCT, the study population included low- and intermediate-risk patients with symptomatic severe AS, enrolled patients were assigned to the TAVR group or SAVR group, and outcomes included all-cause mortality. Severe AS was defined as AS meeting at least one of the following features: (I) peak velocity 4.0 m/s or greater; (II) mean pressure gradient of 40 mmHg or greater; (III) aortic valve area 1.00 cm2 or less. Low-risk and intermediate-risk patients were defined using the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) risk score of less than 4% for low-risk and between 4% and 8% for intermediate-risk patients. The latest article was included if there were several publications from one trial.Data extraction and critical appraisalRelevant studies were identified through a manual search of secondary sources including references of initially identified articles. All references were downloaded for consolidation, elimination of duplicates, and further analyses. Two independent and blinded authors (T.S. and J.S.) reviewed the search results separately to select the studies based on present inclusion and exclusion criteria with a full-text review. Disagreements were resolved by consensus between the two reviewers, with occasional arbitration by a third reviewer (Toshiki Kuno).Data itemsWe sought data according to the following PICOS strategy: P (Population), patients with symptomatic severe AS; I (Intervention), TAVR; C (Comparison), SAVR; O (Outcome), all-cause mortality, all-cause mortality or disabling stroke, cardiovascular mortality, rehospitalization due to heart failure, all stroke, disabling stroke, and bioprosthetic valve failure; and S (Study type), RCTs.Risk of bias in individual studiesStudy quality was assessed by two independent and blinded authors (T.S. and J.S.) using the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias 2.0 (RoB) tool for RCTs (13). Disagreements were resolved by consensus.Summary measuresThe primary outcome of interest was all-cause mortality. The secondary outcomes of interest were a composite outcome (all-cause mortality and disabling stroke), cardiovascular mortality, rehospitalization due to heart failure, all stroke, disabling stroke, and bioprosthetic valve failure. Outcomes including strokes, rehospitalizations, and bioprosthetic valve failure were defined according to the Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 (VARC-2) and VARC-3 endpoint definitions (14,15). The definitions of each outcome are summarized in Table S4 (14,15).Statistical analysisWe analyzed data from included studies based on the approach demonstrated by Liu and colleagues to obtain reconstructed individual time-to-event data from KM curves (16). First, raw data coordinates, including time and event probability, were extracted from KM curves using WebPlotDigitizer (https://automeris.io/WebPlotDigitizer/) (17). KM curves in each study were reconstructed from data coordinates and the numbers at risk at given time points using the R package “IPDfromKM” (version 0.1.10). Reconstructed individual time-to-event data were used to draw KM curves. To assess the accuracy of the calculated data in comparison to the originally extracted data, root mean square error, mean absolute error, and max absolute error were assessed as measures of precision of the estimation based on Liu’s algorithm (16). The reconstructed KM curves in our study met the recommended thresholds of root mean square error ≤0.05, mean absolute error ≤0.02, and max absolute error ≤0.05.We merged the reconstructed KM curves of all eligible studies as demonstrated by Liu and colleagues (16). Cox proportional hazard model with stratification by each study was constructed to compare the outcomes between TAVR and SAVR. The proportionality hazards assumption of each Cox model was checked with the Grambsch and Therneau test (18). The Cox hazard models were also constructed from baseline to 1 year and 1 year and beyond (landmark analysis) for each outcome (19). According to the landmark analysis, we defined the following phases: the initial phase (0–1 year; within the first year) and the late phase (1–5 years; beyond the first year).As a supplement for the Cox proportional hazards model analysis, the restricted mean survival time (RMST) analysis was performed using the survRM2 package (version 1.0.4) in R (20). RMST is the mean duration where patients are free from the outcome, up to a prespecified time point. RMST difference between two treatment groups can be interpreted as the association between treatment and outcome and RMST is considered a robust and interpretable tool. The difference in RMST between the groups for the outcome all-cause mortality shows the lifetime gain or loss associated with the intervention (TAVR) in comparison with the control (SAVR). We set prespecified time points as five years from the initiation of the trial. The analysis was conducted with R Statistical Software (version 4.2.2, Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).Additional analysesSubgroup analyses were conducted by (I) categorizing included studies into TAVRs using balloon-expandable and self-expanding valves; and (II) low- and intermediate-risk studies. Sensitivity analyses were conducted by (I) only incorporating studies with a follow-up period exceeding 1 year; (II) only incorporating studies with >50% use of the current generation of TAVR devices (SAPIEN 3: Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA; and Evolut R, Evolut PRO: Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA). For subgroup analyses, P values for interaction were calculated. When data from multiple studies were unavailable, subgroup and sensitivity analyses were not performed. Substantial heterogeneity was found to be present when the I2 index was over 50%.ResultsStudy selection and characteristicsOur analysis included six RCTs (3-8) which enrolled a total of 7,389 patients with severe AS assigned to the TAVR group (n=3,723) and the SAVR group (n=3,666) (Figure S1).The study profile and patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Definitions of symptomatic severe AS for each trial are also summarized in Table 1. To validate the precision of the extracted data from KM curves, we showed reconstructed KM curves for each outcome in Figures S2-S8 for each study.Table 1Study profiles and patient characteristicsVariablesPARTNER 2ASURTAVIUKTAVINOTIONPARTNER 3EvolutYear202020222022202420232023Follow-up (years)5511054Definition of severe ASVmax ≥4, PG ≥40 mmHg, AVA ≤0.8 cm2, AVI ≤0.5 cm2/m2Vmax ≥4, PG ≥40 mmHg, AVA ≤0.6 cm2, AVI ≤1.0 cm2/m2N/AVmax ≥4, PG ≥40 mmHg, AVA ≤1 cm2, AVI ≤0.6 cm2/m2Vmax ≥4, PG ≥40 mmHg, AVA ≤1 cm2, AVI ≤0.6 cm2/m2Vmax ≥4, PG ≥40 mmHg, AVA ≤1 cm2, AVI ≤0.6 cm2/m2RiskIntermediateIntermediateLowLowLowLowValve typeBalloonSelfBothSelfBalloonSelfPatients (n)   All2,0321,7469132809501,468   TAVR1,011879458145496734   SAVR1,021867455135454734Age (years)   TAVR81.579.98179.273.374   SAVR81.779.7817973.673.8Male (%)   TAVR54.257.653.953.867.563.2   SAVR54.85552.252.671.166.5HTN (%)   TAVRN/AN/A72.171N/A84.9   SAVRN/AN/A72.376.3N/A82.9DM (%)   TAVR37.734.423.417.931.331.1   SAVR34.233.424.520.730.230.5CAD (%)   TAVR69.262.69.5N/A27.7N/A   SAVR66.564.28.9N/A28N/AEuroSCORE (%)   TAVRN/A11.92N/AN/AN/A   SAVRN/A11.62.7N/AN/AN/ASTS-PROM (%)   TAVR5.84.42.62.91.92   SAVR5.84.52.73.11.91.9PG (mmHg)   TAVR44.9N/A73N/AN/A47.2   SAVR44.6N/A74N/AN/A46.7AVA (cm2)   TAVR0.7N/A0.7N/AN/A0.8   SAVR0.7N/A0.7N/AN/A0.8PARTNER, Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves; SURTAVI, Surgical Replacement and Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation; UKTAVI, The UK Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation; NOTION, Nordic Aortic Valve Intervention; AS, aortic stenosis; Vmax, peak aortic jet velocity; PG, pressure gradient; AVA, aortic valve area; AVI, aortic valve index; TAVR, transcatheter aortic valve replacement; SAVR, surgical aortic valve replacement; HTN, hypertension; DM, diabetes mellitus; CAD, coronary artery disease; EuroSCORE, European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation; STS-PROM, Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality; N/A, not available.Risk of biasThe risk of bias for each of the included RCT is summarized in Figure S9. One study was at low risk of bias and other five studies were at intermediate risk of bias.Pooled results from stratified cox proportional hazard modelThe all-cause mortality after TAVR compared with SAVR was comparable [hazard ratio (HR), 1.03; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.93–1.14; P=0.57; six studies] (Figure 1A). The composite outcome of all-cause mortality and disabling stroke was also similar between the two groups (HR, 1.02; 95% CI: 0.92–1.12; P=0.73; four studies) (Figure 1B). The heart failure rehospitalization rates were also similar between the two groups (HR, 1.01; 95% CI: 0.88–1.17; P=0.85; three studies) (Figure 2A). The occurrence of disabling stroke, any stroke, bioprosthetic valve failure, and cardiovascular mortality were also comparable (Figure 2B and Figure S10).Figure 1Kaplan-Meier analysis of (A) all-cause mortality and (B) composite outcome of all-cause mortality and disabling stroke.

In contrast, landmark analysis at 1 year demonstrated a higher all-cause mortality in the TAVR group in the late phase (HR, 1.13; 95% CI: 1.01–1.27; P=0.04) (Figure 3A). Similarly to all-cause mortality, the TAVR group was associated with lower composite outcome in the initial phase but higher composite outcome in the late phase (HR, 0.81; 95% CI: 0.68–0.96; P=0.01 and HR, 1.14; 95% CI: 1.01–1.29; P=0.03, respectively) (Figure 3B). The heart failure rehospitalization followed a similar trend, with initially lower but then higher rates in the TAVR group (HR, 0.81; 95% CI: 0.67–0.97; P=0.02, HR, 1.49; 95% CI: 1.17–1.91; P<0.01, respectively) (Figure S11A).Figure 3Landmark analysis at 1 year of (A) all-cause mortality and (B) composite outcome of all-cause mortality and disabling stroke. HR, hazard ratio; CI, confidence interval; SAVR, surgical aortic valve replacement; TAVR, transcatheter aortic valve replacement.The rates of disabling stroke demonstrated initial favorable results with TAVR and then comparable results in the late phase (HR, 0.72; 95% CI: 0.53–0.97; P=0.03, and HR, 1.11; 95% CI: 0.68–1.82; P=0.68, respectively) (Figure S11B). The rates of any strokes, bioprosthetic valve failure, and cardiovascular mortality were similar in both initial and late phases (Figure S12).Heterogeneity for each outcome in all phases (0–5, 0–1, 1–5 years) was summarized in Table S5. There were substantial heterogeneities in heart failure rehospitalization for all time periods, in addition to any stroke in the initial phase.Additional analysesSubgroup analyses based on the TAVR valve types and the patient risk groups are summarized in Tables S6,S7, demonstrating the HRs and corresponding CIs with SAVR as the control arm. P values for interaction are summarized in Table S8. Subgroup analyses based on the TAVR valve types revealed mostly consistent results as the main analysis (Figure S13). However, the mortality in the late phase was higher with the TAVR group in the subgroup with balloon-expandable TAVR valves, although such a trend was not observed with self-expanding TAVR valves (HR, 1.22; 95% CI: 1.04–1.44; P=0.01, and HR, 1.02; 95% CI: 0.86–1.22; P=0.80, respectively). Subgroup analyses based on the patient risk group were also consistent with the main analysis, except for heart failure rehospitalization (Table S9). The heart failure rehospitalization with the TAVR arm was less frequent than the SAVR arm for low-risk group, while the opposite trend was observed in intermediate-risk groups (HR, 0.66; 95% CI: 0.50–0.88; P<0.01, and HR, 1.19; 95% CI: 1.00–1.42; P<0.05, respectively).Results from sensitivity analyses based on duration of follow-up periods and newer generation TAVR valves are summarized in Tables S9,S10, demonstrating the HRs and corresponding CIs with SAVR as the control arm. Sensitivity analyses limited to studies with a follow-up period over 1 year demonstrated consistent findings as the main analysis (Figure S14). However, with regard to the 1-year outcome, the preference toward TAVR disappeared. Lastly, sensitivity analyses with new-generation TAVR devices demonstrated lower heart failure rehospitalization in the TAVR group (HR, 0.66; 95% CI: 0.50–0.88; P<0.01) (Figure S15). In the initial phase, favorable outcomes with the TAVR group were observed for rehospitalizations and composite outcome (HR, 0.58; 95% CI: 0.41–0.80; P<0.01, HR, 0.51; 95% CI: 0.31–0.85; P=0.01, respectively).Grambsch and Therneau test for time-varying effect demonstrated violation of the proportional hazards assumption for the outcomes of all-cause mortality, the composite outcome, rehospitalization, disabling stroke, any stroke, and cardiovascular mortality, which justifies the need for landmark analyses (Table S11). The differences in RMST at 5 years were calculated between SAVR (a reference group) and TAVR. No significant difference was observed for each outcome (Table S12 and Figure S16).DiscussionWe performed a meta-analysis of six RCTs including 7,389 low-/intermediate-risk patients to report the mid-term clinical outcomes. Our analysis demonstrated similar all-cause mortality between TAVR and SAVR. Similarly, the composite outcome of all-cause mortality and disabling stroke was also comparable, as well as heart-failure rehospitalization. In the initial phase (0–1 years), TAVR was associated with favorable all-cause mortality, the composite outcome, disabling stroke, and heart failure rehospitalization. However, in the late phase (1–5 years), TAVR was associated with worse outcomes in all-cause mortality, composite outcome, and heart failure rehospitalization. Although we await the long-term outcomes, our data may be useful in guiding optimal therapy selection during the decision-making process.The current U.S. and European guidelines both recommend shared decision-making with a Heart Team to opt between TAVR and SAVR (9,10). The U.S. guideline recommends TAVR as an equal alternative to SAVR for patients aged between 65 and 80 years, and TAVR is recommended in preference for patients above age 80 years (9). Meanwhile, the European guideline recommends TAVR for patients over 75 years of age, irrespective of the risk group (10). This discrepancy is due to the absence of robust, definitive long-term data, and the publication of mid-term data for the Evolut and PARTNER 3 trial warrants a reappraisal of the up-to-date data.Previous meta-analyses demonstrated superior short-term outcomes with the TAVR group for low- and intermediate-risk patients (21-23). Our analysis of 1-year results also demonstrated favorable outcomes with the TAVR arm, congruent to such findings. However, our analysis of mid-term outcomes demonstrated no between-group differences. Additionally, our landmark analysis indicated less favorable outcomes with the TAVR arm in the late phase. This disappearing initial advantage of TAVR coincides with a few meta-analyses employing methods to account for chronological trends, including phase-specific (11) or KM-derived reconstructed time-to-event data approaches (22,24,25). However, such findings in previous reports were likely driven by the high-risk patient groups due to the higher event rates. Our study is the first to demonstrate such a trend specifically for low- and intermediate-risk patients. Notably, our study is the first to also include follow-up data beyond two years for both PARTNER 3 and Evolut Low Risk trials.The higher mortality initially observed with SAVR can be attributed to its inherently higher procedural invasiveness associated with general anesthesia, full sternotomy, cardioplegic arrest and cardiopulmonary bypass (26). Causes of mortality were previously examined in post-hoc analyses of RCTs concerning self-expandable TAVR valves. Deaths in TAVR arm were primarily linked to procedural technical issues, whereas deaths following SAVR were connected to postoperative complications (26-28). Meanwhile, clinical outcome determinants for long-term outcomes are different, including prosthesis-patient mismatch which can increase mortality for both TAVR (29) and SAVR (30,31) in the long run, paravalvular leaks which are associated with higher risk of all-cause mortality, rehospitalization, and cardiovascular mortality (32), structural valve degeneration and permanent pacemaker implantation which is associated with higher risk of mortality and heart failure-related rehospitalization over time (33). These factors are especially important for low- and intermediate-risk groups, where patients are expected to outlive their implanted valves. The development of new-generation TAVR valves protective against such risks could improve the long-term outcomes. Our sensitivity analysis limited to studies with new-generation TAVR valves demonstrated noninferior survival with a landmark analysis after 1 year, with reduced heart failure rehospitalization. Such results may be influenced by superior fluid dynamics associated with newer valves (34,35).Despite the growing population receiving TAVRs (36), the literature on cardiac reoperations post-TAVR remains sparse. The incidence of post-TAVR cardiac reoperations significantly increased after the approval of TAVR for low-risk patients by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2019 (37,38). TAVR explants constitute nearly half of post-TAVR reoperations (37) and the proportion of patients belonging to the low-/intermediate-risk groups at the initial TAVR exceeded that of high-risk patients in 2021 (39). This warrants caution, as post-TAVR reoperations are associated with high morbidity and mortality (37,39), and careful consideration is warranted during the initial patient selection process.Regarding heart failure rehospitalizations, our analysis demonstrated overall similar outcomes between groups. However, our landmark analysis yielded initially lower but eventually higher rates for the TAVR group. Heart failure rehospitalization has been associated with heightened mortality in a post-hoc analysis of the PARTNER trials (40). Interestingly, the subgroup analysis demonstrated the higher late-phase mortality with balloon-expandable valves, while no such trend was observed with self-expanding valves. However, the mortality in the SAVR arm for PARTNER 3 and Evolut Low Risk trials were different (6,7), rendering any direct comparison between the two low-risk trials less definitive. A direct comparison of self-expanding and balloon expandable valves is out of the scope of this study, and our subgroup results are exploratory and only hypothesis-generating at best.A cautious approach is imperative before extrapolating our findings to clinical practice. It is worth mentioning that a lack of equity was present between the two groups with respect to the frequency of concomitant procedures. As recently mentioned in the joint statement by the STS and European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery, up to 26% of the SAVR group in the PARTNER 3 and Evolut low risk trials underwent concomitant procedures, including concomitant coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) (6,7). These procedures were not only CABGs, but also mitral, tricuspid valve procedures, and interestingly even ascending aortic replacement and septal myectomy in the SAVR arm (6). In the Evolut low risk trial, a notably high mortality rate was observed in the SAVR arm at four years (12.1%) (7). Meanwhile, five-year mortality with isolated SAVR was 7.1% in the STS database report with 42,586 patients, following the same inclusion/exclusion criteria as the PARTNER 3 and Evolut low risk trials (41). In contrast to the SAVR arm, TAVR was almost exclusively an isolated valve procedure, except for few percutaneous coronary interventions. Notably, concomitant SAVR with CABG has been associated with superior outcomes than concomitant TAVR with percutaneous coronary intervention (42).Additionally, the heterogeneity of implanted prostheses in these RCTs represents an inherent bias. A significant number of TAVR valves were earlier generation prostheses (3,4,8). For both balloon expandable and self-expanding TAVR valves, newer generation devices have been associated with superior outcomes (34,35). In contrast, in the SAVR arm, a number of patients received an externally mounted leaflet prosthesis, which is known to be associated with early bioprosthetic valve failure (43). NOTION and SURTAVI trials, in which approximately 30% of patients in the SAVR arm received these valves, demonstrated strikingly higher bioprosthetic valve failure rates in the SAVR group. When opting for the initial treatment modality for severe, symptomatic AS, a careful patient-tailored approach with consideration to the lifetime management with a Heart Team approach is necessary (9).An aspect we should keep in mind is that RCTs comparing TAVR with SAVR demonstrate conflicting evidence, particularly in low-risk patients. Jacquemyn et al. (44) recently reevaluated the evidence using trial sequential analysis, balancing type I and II errors, and compared their findings with conventional meta-analysis. Lower-risk RCTs suggested lower death risk on conventional meta-analysis (relative risk, 0.67, 95% CI: 0.47–0.96, P=0.031), but trial sequential analysis indicated potential spurious evidence (P=0.116), necessitating more data for conclusive benefit. For the composite endpoint of death or disabling stroke at 1 year in lower-risk RCTs, TAVR indicated lower risk in conventional meta-analysis (relative risk, 0.68, 95% CI: 0.50–0.93, P=0.014), but trial sequential analysis suggested potential spurious evidence (P=0.053), necessitating more data for conclusive benefit. Follow-up results provided inconclusive evidence for both primary outcomes across risk categories. The authors concluded that conventional meta-analysis methods may have prematurely declared an early reduction of negative outcomes after TAVR when compared with SAVR.LimitationsThis study has several limitations. First, follow-up data beyond 5 years was only available for the NOTION trial (8). Second, not all cases underwent isolated procedures in the included RCTs. Third, the results from subgroup analyses must be interpreted as exploratory outcomes. Fourth, the valve types used in the SURTAVI, PARTNER 2, and NOTION trials are no longer used in the current clinical practice. Furthermore, there was a substantial amount of bias in the included RCTs. A substantial proportion of deviation from randomly assigned treatment, loss to follow-up, and additionally performed procedures were observed in the SAVR group (45).The frequent loss to follow-up and deviation from assigned treatment in the SAVR arm was markedly higher in comparison to TAVR arm (45,46). In this study, publication bias was not assessed using the funnel plot owning to the insufficient number of included trials in this meta-analysis. Furthermore, incorporating low and intermediate-risk groups may have generated bias in this study. However, as TAVR application expands to these groups, it’s vital to generate relevant evidence, to which this study contributes. Lastly, the SAVR group in the included RCTs contained some portions of patients with concomitant procedures, which could have influenced the results.ConclusionsThis meta-analysis demonstrated that the survival was similar between TAVR and SAVR for low- and intermediate-risk patients with severe symptomatic AS. Our analysis also demonstrated TAVR to be associated with favorable survival in the initial year. However, a landmark analysis indicated suboptimal survival after 1 year in the TAVR arm. Additional RCT results with longer follow-up durations are warranted to confirm this trend.SupplementaryThe article’s supplementary files as10.21037/acs-2024-etavr-0096"}
{"PMCID": "12028081", "title": "The Role of ARNI in Enhancing Outcomes of Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy: A Comprehensive Review", "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) and angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs) are cornerstone therapies for patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). However, nearly 30% of patients show no significant response to CRT alone. The potential of ARNI to enhance CRT outcomes—especially in non-responders—is an emerging field of interest. The objective of this review is to systematically evaluate and synthesize the available evidence on the clinical outcomes of combining CRT with ARNI therapy in patients with HFrEF. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive search of PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar up to September 2024, using the keywords “CRT and ARNI” and “cardiac resynchronization therapy and sacubitril/valsartan”. We included retrospective and prospective clinical studies, observational studies, and review articles reporting on patients with HFrEF treated with both CRT and ARNI. Studies not in English, animal studies, and those without full-text availability were excluded. Study selection and data extraction were performed in duplicate by independent reviewers, using PRISMA guidelines for transparency. The final selection included 8 studies published in the last four years, summarized by design, population, outcomes, and statistical significance. Results: The reviewed studies suggest that ARNI therapy, when combined with CRT, may contribute to improvements in left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF), NYHA functional class, and ventricular remodeling, particularly in CRT non-responders. Some studies also report a potential reduction in ventricular arrhythmias and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) interventions. However, outcomes varied across subgroups, and the influence of ARNI timing relative to CRT implantation remains inconclusive. Limitations: Heterogeneity in study designs and small sample sizes in some included studies limited the ability to conduct a meta-analysis. This review is not registered. Conclusions: ARNI therapy shows promise in enhancing CRT response in patients with HFrEF, particularly in non-responders. Further large-scale, prospective studies are needed to clarify optimal patient selection and treatment sequencing.", "body": "1. IntroductionHF is the result of some cardiac conditions, which may cause gradual weakening or stiffening of the heart, leading to a reduced capacity to fill and pump blood effectively. HF was divided into two categories: heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and HFrEF and, as of the latest guidelines in the field, an intermediate category emerging, with characteristics overlapping both HFrEF and HFpEF—heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction. This classification is based on the measurement of LVEF. Loss of cardiomyocytes leads to HFrEF, a condition more frequently observed in men [1,2,3]. Patients with cardiomyopathy and valvular heart disease are often hospitalized for HF, the leading cause of these admissions. This condition is linked to high mortality and morbidity rates globally [4].Significant efforts have focused on determining the best treatment strategy for heart failure to alleviate symptoms and improve patient outcomes. Congestion-related symptoms are commonly treated with diuretics and digitalis. Diuretics help decrease the heart’s workload, while digitalis improves myocardial contractility [5]. Angiotensin receptor inhibitors, beta-blockers, ACEIs, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists have shown effectiveness in improving symptoms and outcomes. Studies have demonstrated these therapies enhance quality of life, reverse ventricular remodeling, and lower mortality and hospitalization rates [6].CRT is regarded as one of the most effective cardiac remodeling therapies, surpassed only by beta-blockers [7]. It promotes reverse remodeling, decreases the size of the left ventricle and atrium, improves LVEF, and lessens the severity of functional mitral regurgitation. These benefits have been associated with favorable clinical outcomes in the MADIT-CRT and REVERSE trials [8].Moreover, recent observations indicate that ARNI provides superior cardiovascular protection for HF patients compared to traditional therapies [9]. The combination ARNI has shown effectiveness in improving hemodynamic and neurohormonal outcomes in HF cases. A study revealed that this drug outperformed angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) in reducing the risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalization among HFrEF patients [10].The PROVE-HF trial [11] recently highlighted ARNI’s effects on cardiac remodelling, revealing a 9.4% increase in LVEF over a 12-month period, along with reductions in the left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volume indices, as well as the left atrial volume index. Additionally, the Italian observational study SAVE-ICD, led by Federico Guerra, found that following six months of ARNI therapy, 25% of patients implanted with ICDs for primary prevention reached an LVEF of 35% or higher [12].The CeRtiTude cohort study, conducted more recently, found comparable rates of sudden cardiac death (SCD) between CRT-P and CRT-D recipients over a two-year follow-up, despite the CRT-P group being older, having poorer health status, and presenting with more comorbid conditions [13]. A 2019 analysis by Barra et al. [14] indicated that the risk of SCD in patients undergoing CRT has dropped by over four times in the last two decades, with a more pronounced reduction observed among those treated with CRT-P. This reduction was linked to increased LVEF, greater beta-blocker use, reduced QRS duration, and less frequent use of antiarrhythmic drugs [14]. The PARADIGM trial showed a 22% reduction in SCD rates [2]. Studies by de Diego et al. [15] and Martens et al. [16] found that ARNI significantly reduced sustained and non-sustained ventricular arrhythmias, appropriate ICD shocks, and improved pacing parameters in ICD patients on ARNI [17]. ARNI reduces arrhythmia burden mainly by enhancing cardiac remodeling, though smaller studies have also shown reductions in QRS duration, QTc interval, and mechanical dispersion, evaluated through LV global longitudinal strain imaging [18]. ARNI’s beneficial influence on electrophysiological parameters is thought to be mediated primarily through reverse cardiac remodeling, potentially reducing fibrosis and scar burden—key contributors to electrical dys-synchrony and CRT non-response. Fibrosis and increased myocardial scar tissue disrupt the integrity of the conduction system, resulting in heterogeneous electrical conduction and impaired synchronization. In this context, ARNI therapy has demonstrated efficacy in modulating myocardial fibrosis and reducing adverse electrical remodeling. For instance, ARNI treatment in CRT non-responders was associated with significant improvements in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and ventricular volumes, as well as modulation of microRNAs linked to fibrosis, apoptosis, and hypertrophy. These findings underline ARNI’s capability to enhance the CRT response by ameliorating electrical conduction abnormalities, improving myocardial electrophysiological homogeneity, and potentially reversing structural myocardial damage, thus offering a promising pharmacologic adjunct to enhance CRT outcomes.The 2023 Focused Updates on the 2021 ESC Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure reinforce the importance of CRT and and guideline-directed medical therapy GDMT in HF management. CRT remains a Class I recommendation for patients with HFrEF (LVEF ≤ 35%), sinus rhythm, and QRS ≥ 150 ms (especially with LBBB morphology) who remain symptomatic despite optimal GDMT. Early CRT implantation is now emphasized in LBBB-induced cardiomyopathy, particularly in patients with a poor response to medical therapy. Additionally, CRT in atrial fibrillation patients with HFrEF is beneficial if a high percentage (>95%) of biventricular pacing can be achieved, with AV node ablation considered in cases of inadequate pacing. The GDMT recommendations have been strengthened, particularly with ARNI now preferred over ACEi and ARBs in HFrEF patients (Class I), while SGLT2 inhibitors (dapagliflozin and empagliflozin) maintain a strong Class I recommendation for all HFrEF patients, regardless of diabetes status. Beta-blockers and MRAs continue to be Class I recommendations, while diuretics are used only for symptom relief and congestion management. Notably, quadruple therapy (ARNI + beta-blocker + MRA + SGLT2 inhibitor) is now recommended within 4 weeks for eligible patients, reflecting a shift toward early, aggressive medical optimization. Overall, GDMT remains the foundation of HF management, with CRT integrated early in eligible patients, ensuring an optimal balance between pharmacologic and device-based therapies [19].The diagram below illustrates the ESC Guidelines for HF regarding CRT and GDMT (Figure 1) [19].This article aims to evaluate the effectiveness of combining ARNI therapy with CRT in individuals diagnosed with HFrEF.2. Materials and MethodsWe systematically conducted a comprehensive literature search, targeting multiple published study designs, including retrospective studies, prospective studies, and review articles. Our search encompassed widely recognized databases, specifically PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus, using relevant keyword combinations: “CRT and ARNI” or “Cardiac resynchronization therapy and sacubitril/valsartan”. To ensure methodological rigor and transparency, the study selection process adhered strictly to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.In addition to electronic database searches, manual searches were meticulously conducted to enhance the identification of potentially relevant studies. PubMed searches specifically utilized Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms to efficiently identify articles associated with CRT, ARNI, and HFrEF therapy.Studies were excluded if they were not available in the English language, involved animal subjects rather than humans, represented duplicate publications, or consisted solely of abstracts without accessible full-text articles. The literature search was completed in September 2024 and was intentionally unrestricted regarding the publication year to capture all relevant historical and contemporary studies. The search and subsequent screening processes were independently performed by cardiologists specialized in heart failure management to ensure the inclusion of pertinent and high-quality research.Initially, a manual screening was performed by reviewing article titles with explicit reference to the keywords “CRT and ARNI” and “Heart failure therapy.” Following this, an advanced PubMed search was executed using the MeSH term “CRT and ARNI” [Mesh] to capture additional eligible studies comprehensively. All qualifying articles identified during this thorough selection process were systematically documented in a structured Microsoft Excel table (version 2408), featuring detailed information including the title of the study, names of authors, year of publication, journal name, and the specific type of publication. Study selection and data extraction were performed in duplicate by independent reviewers.A simplified risk of bias analysis was performed using modified criteria based on the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale, appropriate for the predominantly observational and retrospective nature of the included studies. Each study was assessed for selection bias, outcome/exposure clarity, and follow-up adequacy. The overall risk of bias was rated as low, moderate, or high. Most included studies were of moderate quality, with some limitations related to small sample size, non-randomized design, and lack of comparability between groups. These limitations were acknowledged in the interpretation of findings. Another limitation was the heterogeneity in study designs and small sample sizes in some included studies, which limited the ability to conduct a meta-analysis. The review was initiated retrospectively, and a formal protocol had not been developed or submitted for registration prior to the literature search and data synthesis. While registration is considered best practice, the review was conducted with adherence to PRISMA 2020 guidelines to ensure methodological transparency and rigor.The diagram illustrates the methodology used by the authors for selecting articles, created using Microsoft Office suite. A total of 3409 articles were identified through search engines using the keywords “CRT in heart failure” and 1486 articles using “ARNI in HF” or “angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor in HF”. After searching articles that comprised both “CRT and ARNI in HF” keywords and removing duplicates and excluding articles that were irrelevant or failed to meet the predefined inclusion criteria, the final selection comprised 8 articles (Figure 2).3. ResultsThe table below summarizes key studies published over the past four years, detailing their titles, authors, publication year, patient population, and main findings (Table 1).3.1. Timing of ARNI Therapy in Relation to CRTA total of 258 patients were enrolled in this study, of whom 202 (78%) were male, with a mean age of 69.4 years. Among these individuals, the majority (67.4%) had an ischemic etiology of HF with reduced ejection fraction. Additionally, a substantial proportion of these patients presented with multiple comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus (68%), dyslipidemia (87%), and arterial hypertension (73%), reflecting the high cardiovascular risk burden in this population. Regarding the response to CRT, fifty-two percent (133 patients) were classified as CRT responders, demonstrating an improvement in left ventricular function following device implantation. However, when comparing patients who received ARNI and/or SGLT2i with those who did not, there was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of CRT responders between the two groups (55% vs. 47%; p = not significant). Similarly, the mean increase in LVEF was comparable between patients who received ARNI or SGLT2i therapy and those who did not, with no significant variation observed (+7.7% vs. +10.3%; p = not significant). Furthermore, within the subgroup of patients who were prescribed ARNI or SGLT2i, no significant differences were identified between those who had initiated these therapies prior to CRT implantation and those who commenced treatment afterward. This suggests that, in this cohort, the timing of ARNI or SGLT2i introduction did not appear to significantly influence the likelihood of CRT response or improvements in LVEF. These findings underscore the need for further research to elucidate the potential interaction between pharmacologic therapy and device-based interventions in patients with HFrEF. [22].Another study specifically examined the potential benefits of CRT in patients diagnosed with LBBB-induced cardiomyopathy, a condition characterized by electromechanical dys-synchrony that contributes to progressive left ventricular dysfunction and adverse remodeling. The findings suggest that early CRT implantation in this subset of patients is associated with significant improvements in LVEF and functional capacity, with a proportion of individuals experiencing complete normalization of LVEF, effectively reversing their cardiomyopathy. This hyper-response phenomenon highlights the potential of CRT to correct conduction abnormalities, restore synchronous ventricular contraction, and promote favorable cardiac remodeling, particularly in patients without extensive structural myocardial damage. Conversely, in patients with LBBB-induced cardiomyopathy, optimal medical therapy (OMT) based on current clinical guidelines does not appear to consistently induce significant improvements in LVEF or functional class, raising the question of whether pharmacologic treatment alone is sufficient for managing this condition. While GDMT remains the cornerstone of HF treatment, its efficacy in modifying disease progression in LBBB-related cardiomyopathy seems to be limited, reinforcing the role of early CRT intervention in appropriately selected cases. The timing of CRT implantation in relation to OMT continues to be a topic of active investigation, with ongoing research seeking to determine the optimal therapeutic sequence that maximizes patient outcomes. Whether early CRT implantation should be prioritized over prolonged attempts at pharmacologic optimization remains an open question, as studies continue to assess the relative impact of timely device-based intervention versus extended medical management. Further clinical trials are needed to clarify which patient subgroups may benefit most from early CRT implantation, particularly in cases where OMT alone fails to yield meaningful improvements in LV function and HF symptoms. [25].3.2. Impact of ARNI and SGLT2i on CRT OutcomesA retrospective study investigating the outcomes of 183 patients with HFrEF undergoing CRT sought to determine the impact ARNI SGLT2i on cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. The study cohort included a diverse population of ischemic and non-ischemic HFrEF patients, with a median age of 73 years (interquartile range 65–80 years) and 148 males (80.9%). A majority of patients (117, 74%) were prescribed ARNI (n = 61, 52.1%), SGLT2i (n = 7, 6%), or a combination of both (n = 49, 41.9%) and were classified under the ARNI/SGLT2i group. During a median follow-up period of 5.67 years (95% CI, 5–6.5 years), a total of 63 patients (34.4%) died, with the primary cause of death being cardiovascular-related HF in 74.6% of cases. Specifically, 44 deaths occurred in the no-drugs group, with 35 cases (79%) attributed to HF-related mortality, whereas only 19 deaths occurred in patients treated with ARNI and/or SGLT2i, among whom 12 cases (63%) were HF-related. In univariable analysis, treatment with ARNI and/or SGLT2i was associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 0.59, p = 0.056) and cardiovascular mortality (HR 0.47, p = 0.029), suggesting a potential protective effect of these medications on long-term survival in patients with CRT and HFrEF. However, following multivariable adjustment for key clinical and demographic covariates—including age, one-year CRT response, baseline LVEF, atrial fibrillation status, glomerular filtration rate, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease—the mortality reduction benefits previously attributed to ARNI and SGLT2i diminished. Among all analyzed factors, the most significant prognostic indicator for reduced mortality risk was a positive response to CRT at one year, reaffirming the pivotal role of CRT efficacy in determining long-term survival outcomes. These findings suggest that while ARNI and SGLT2i therapy may contribute to improved HF management, their direct impact on enhancing CRT response and mortality reduction remains influenced by patient-specific variables. Moreover, the timing of ARNI/SGLT2i initiation relative to CRT implantation did not appear to significantly alter CRT response rates or survival outcomes, emphasizing the need for further studies to elucidate the synergistic potential of pharmacological and device-based therapies in HFrEF patients undergoing CRT [26].3.3. ARNI in CRT Non-RespondersGiven that nearly 30% of patients do not respond favorably to CRT, ARNI has been explored as a potential modifier of outcomes. In a cohort of CRT non-responders, ARNI therapy initiated six months post-implantation resulted in significant improvements over six months, similarly to what was observed in the general HF patient cohort with no CRT. Both groups showed significant improvements in LVEF and NYHA class. In CRT non-responders, LVEF increased from 25.25% to 29.5% (p < 0.001), NYHA class improved from 2.74 to 2.03 (p < 0.001), and NT-proBNP levels significantly decreased from 3884 to 2676 pg/mL, (p < 0.001). These effects were comparable to those observed in general HF patients without CRT, suggesting that ARNI therapy independently contributes to cardiac function recovery in CRT non-responders [20].Data from a prospective, multicenter study evaluating ARNI in CRTd non-responders (patients receiving CRT with a defibrillator but failing to achieve expected benefits) also found improvements in cardiac remodeling markers, with a significant proportion of patients (34.9%) converting to CRT responders compared to only 6.4% in the non-ARNI group. This study revealed significant improvements in LVEF, LVESV, and functional capacity. Among ARNI users, LVEF increased significantly (p < 0.01) along with improved six-minute walking test (6MWT) performance. Additionally, ARNI therapy modulated key microRNAs (miR-18, miR-145, and miR-181) associated with cardiac fibrosis, apoptosis, and hypertrophy. At one-year follow-up, 34.9% of ARNI users transitioned to CRT responders, compared to only 6.4% of non-ARNI users, indicating that ARNI enhances anti-remodeling effects and functional recovery in CRT patients [23].3.4. Potential Reduction in the Need for Device Therapy with ARNIRecent studies indicate a growing body of evidence supporting the idea that integrating ARNI into OMT could potentially reduce the reliance on device-based therapy, particularly in patients with milder forms of HFrEF. This hypothesis is grounded in the well-documented ability of ARNI to promote reverse cardiac remodeling, enhance LVEF, and significantly lower hospitalization rates due to HF exacerbations. These effects suggest that, in some cases, early and aggressive medical management with ARNI may be sufficient to stabilize or even improve cardiac function, thereby delaying the need for CRT or, in select cases, rendering its implantation unnecessary. Additionally, findings from clinical trials and real-world data underscore the potential of ARNI therapy to modify disease progression in HFrEF, particularly in patients with LBBB-induced cardiomyopathy, where the interplay between conduction abnormalities and LV dysfunction is a key determinant of CRT candidacy. By improving myocardial efficiency and reducing ventricular dilation, ARNI therapy may allow a subset of patients to achieve significant functional recovery without requiring biventricular pacing. However, while these observations are promising, further longitudinal studies and randomized clinical trials are needed to determine the precise role of ARNI in influencing CRT decision-making, particularly in defining which patient populations may benefit most from a pharmacologic-first approach before considering device implantation [27].4. DiscussionThe findings from these studies suggest that while ARNI and SGLT2i may provide significant therapeutic benefits when used in combination with CRT, their impact on long-term survival and cardiac function improvement appears to be modulated by multiple patient-specific factors. One of the most critical determinants influencing these outcomes is the individual response to CRT, which has been identified as a key prognostic factor in HF management. This underscores the complex and multidimensional nature of HF treatment, particularly in patients with HFrEF undergoing device-based therapy, where a personalized approach to treatment is necessary to optimize clinical outcomes.A significant proportion of HFrEF patients do not respond optimally to CRT alone, highlighting the need for complementary pharmacological strategies to enhance reverse remodeling and functional recovery. Among these, ARNI therapy has demonstrated promise in improving LVEF and functional status in CRT non-responders, suggesting that this approach may provide additional benefits beyond conventional GDMT. However, an important consideration emerging from the literature is the lack of significant differences in cardiac outcomes between patients who received ARNI and/or SGLT2i prior to CRT implantation versus those who initiated therapy after device implantation. This observation challenges previous assumptions regarding the optimal timing of pharmacologic therapy in relation to CRT and suggests that the beneficial effects of ARNI and SGLT2i may not be time-dependent but rather contingent on the patient’s underlying cardiac condition, CRT response, and overall disease progression.The role of CRT in LBBB-induced cardiomyopathy remains well-established, with early intervention in these patients being consistently associated with improved LVEF and functional capacity. This reinforces the importance of timely diagnosis and appropriate patient selection for CRT implantation, as delayed intervention may limit the extent of cardiac reverse remodeling and symptom improvement. Furthermore, recent discussions in the field have raised the possibility that ARNI therapy could reduce the need for CRT and other device-based therapies in select HFrEF patients, particularly in those with less severe conduction abnormalities or those who demonstrate significant improvements in cardiac function with medical therapy alone. This therapeutic paradigm shift suggests a potential role for early pharmacologic optimization before proceeding with CRT implantation, an area that warrants further large-scale clinical trials to establish more definitive treatment algorithms.Despite the increasing volume of studies supporting the use of ARNI therapy in CRT non-responders, the level of efficacy appears to vary based on patient characteristics, baseline LV function, and disease progression at the time of intervention. Additionally, the studies reviewed highlight the need for longer follow-up durations to assess whether ARNI therapy can consistently enhance CRT outcomes or potentially serve as an alternative to device therapy in specific subsets of patients. While CRT remains a cornerstone of treatment in appropriately selected patients, the integration of advanced pharmacological agents such as ARNI and SGLT2i into HF management continues to evolve. Future randomized controlled trials with extended follow-up periods will be crucial in determining whether a combination of medical and device-based therapy provides superior outcomes or if a medical-first approach may be viable in specific clinical scenarios.Historically, patients with HF receiving CRT were primarily managed with ACEi or ARBs. Landmark CRT trials in the pre-ARNI era, such as MADIT-CRT [28], COMPANION [29], and CARE-HF [30], demonstrated significant benefits including improved quality of life, decreased mortality, and reduced hospitalization rates for patients receiving CRT along with a conventional neurohormonal blockade (ACEi/ARBs, MRAs, and beta-blockers). Studies conducted in the ARNI era, including subgroup analyses of the PARADIGM-HF [2] and PROVE-HF [31] trials, showed that ARNI administration provided superior clinical outcomes compared to ACEi or ARBs alone. When comparing CRT-supported HF patients receiving ARNI versus those treated with ACEi or ARBs, studies suggest synergistic benefits. CRT combined with ARNI therapy has shown superior improvements in ventricular function and patient outcomes compared to CRT combined with ACEi or ARB therapy alone. This combined therapy enhances the benefits originally documented with CRT, including more pronounced reverse remodeling and better clinical prognosis. Thus, contemporary evidence increasingly supports the combined use of CRT and ARNI therapy as an optimal strategy for selected patients with HF, significantly surpassing outcomes observed in earlier studies using CRT plus ACEi or ARBs alone.An area warranting further investigation is the impact of peri-procedural complications, such as contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) on CRT outcomes. Strisciuglio et al. [32] reported that CIN following CRT implantation can impair the recovery of LVEF in responders. While our review centers on ARNI’s role in enhancing CRT response, acknowledging and mitigating such complications is crucial for optimizing patient outcomes. Future research should aim to elucidate strategies to prevent CIN and assess its long-term impact on CRT efficacy.These findings emphasize the critical importance of individualized treatment strategies, where the timing, sequencing, and combination of CRT and medical therapy should be tailored to maximize patient outcomes while minimizing unnecessary interventions. Further research is needed to refine patient selection criteria, optimize treatment algorithms, and determine the best approaches to integrating pharmacologic advancements with device-based therapies in HFrEF management.Ultimately, a subject deserving further investigation is the potential of ARNI to influence electrophysiological mechanisms underlying CRT response. While preliminary findings suggest beneficial effects on electrical remodeling and conduction system parameters, more robust, large-scale studies are needed to fully elucidate ARNI’s role in modulating these processes. This represents a promising direction for future research, which may help refine patient selection and improve CRT response rates.5. ConclusionsCRT and ARNI therapy are both recognized as cornerstone treatments for patients with HFrEF, each addressing distinct pathophysiological mechanisms and requiring careful patient selection to maximize therapeutic benefits. While CRT primarily functions by mechanically synchronizing ventricular contractions, thereby improving left ventricular efficiency and overall cardiac performance, ARNI therapy exerts its effects through neurohormonal modulation, enhancing natriuretic peptide activity while simultaneously inhibiting the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS). The complementary nature of these two interventions underscores the importance of a tailored, patient-specific approach in HF management, ensuring that individuals receive the most appropriate combination of device-based and pharmacologic therapy.Given the heterogeneity of HFrEF populations, identifying specific subgroups of patients who derive the greatest benefit from CRT-ARNI combination therapy remains a key clinical objective. Future research efforts will be critical in refining patient selection criteria and optimizing treatment algorithms. The ultimate goal is to enhance long-term survival, reduce heart failure-related hospitalizations, and improve overall quality of life in affected individuals. Ongoing large-scale randomized trials, with extended follow-up periods, such as LIFE [33] and PARAGLIDE-HF [34], will be instrumental in providing high-quality evidence to confirm and further clarify the role of CRT and ARNI integration in HF management, helping to establish standardized guidelines for determining the optimal timing, sequencing, and patient selection for this combined therapeutic approach.Another crucial aspect of optimizing HF therapy is determining the most effective integration of pharmacologic and device-based interventions. While CRT has been proven to significantly improve outcomes in patients with electrical dys-synchrony, the addition of ARNI and SGLT2i therapies has demonstrated a reduction in mortality and an improvement in cardiac function, particularly in patients who already exhibit a favorable response to CRT. However, findings also suggest that the precise timing of ARNI or SGLT2i initiation may not be as critical as ensuring continuous adherence to optimal medical therapy, emphasizing the importance of long-term treatment persistence and follow-up rather than immediate initiation post-CRT implantation.Despite the increasing number of studies examining CRT and ARNI therapy independently, there has been no prior review that comprehensively synthesizes the evidence on their combined use in HF treatment within a single discussion. The integration of pharmacologic and device-based therapies remains an evolving field, and future advancements will likely focus on developing hybrid treatment approaches that maximize synergistic benefits while tailoring interventions to individual patient needs. Further long-term studies, registries, and real-world data analyses will be essential to establishing best practices, refining treatment guidelines, and ensuring that each patient receives the most effective therapeutic combination to manage HFrEF effectively."}

The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has emerged as a potential biomarker for predicting ISR, offering opportunities for improved risk stratification and treatment personalization. This systematic review and meta-analysis assess the predictive value of NLR in ISR, providing insights into its clinical applicability.MethodsSystematic literature search was conducted in scientific databases until 21st July 2024. Observational studies evaluating NLR in stented patients were included. Random effect meta-analysis and linear regression model were used to investigate odds ratios (OR) as predictor and linear dose-response relationship of ISR. Sensitivity and specificity of NLR to predict this outcome were pooled and a summary receiver operating characteristics (sROC) curve was generated. This study was already registered in the PROSPERO (ID: CRD42024555123).Results15 studies with 3 889 patients were included. High NLR was associated with increased risk of ISR in coronary and non-coronary stenting [aOR = 1.61 (95%CI 1.14–2.25); aOR = 1.69 (95%CI 1.52–1.87)]. One unit increase of NLR is equal to 30% and 44% increased risk of ISR in coronary and non-coronary patients.

Additionally, NLR appears to be more proficient in predicting early ISR compared to late ISR in both coronary and non-coronary stents.", "body": "IntroductionOver the past decades, percutaneous vascular interventions have made remarkable progress. Despite these advancements, in-stent restenosis (ISR) remains a major clinical challenge, due to the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells and subsequent neointimal formation. These developments can impair stent effectiveness, leading to symptom recurrence and the need for further revascularization [1]. In non-coronary stenting, ISR has been reported in 18–40% of patients within the first year of treatment, especially in long and complex lesions [2]. In coronary stenting, the latest drug-eluting stents (DES) significantly reduce neointimal hyperplasia and the risk of ISR, improving the efficacy of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), with 50–70% of cases particularly occurring within the first month. This condition poses ongoing clinical challenges and increases the risk of major adverse cardiac events compared to PCI for new lesions [3,4].Beyond the established cardiovascular risk factors, easily accessible laboratory parameters can enhance risk stratification for patients undergoing percutaneous vascular interventions. Inflammation plays a crucial role in ISR development and recent studies have highlighted the prognostic significance of inflammatory biomarkers, such as neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in predicting adverse cardiovascular events and procedural outcomes. NLR is cost-effective and widely available, making them particularly useful and applicable in both high-resource and low-resource healthcare settings. [5]. It is proven to be associated with adverse outcomes in various cardiovascular conditions. NLR shows promising potential as a predictor of ISR due to its correlation with the severity and activity of atherosclerotic and vascular disease as the fundamental causes of ISR. Although the link between various inflammatory markers, including NLR, has been explored, their predictive value in predicting ISR remains unclear [6]. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to thoroughly evaluate the prognostic utility of NLR in predicting ISR in order to enhance risk stratification and contribute to a more personalized treatment strategies for patient management following both coronary and non-coronary stent implantation.Materials and methodsA protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42024555123). This systematic review was conducted in accordance to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Diagnostic Test Accuracy version 1.0.0 and followed the Preferred Reporting Items for a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guideline, for reporting research merit and transparency.Search strategyA systematic literature investigation was conducted on July 21st, 2024, across multiple scientific databases including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, ProQuest, and Cochrane, using a predefined set of keywords and synonyms based in MeSH terms and Boolean operators, listed in the Supplementary file. The process was done by two authors (PPS and WW) independently to screen for relevant articles according to the inclusion criteria and to assess the full texts subsequently. Manual searching was conducted to ensure comprehensive coverage. Any discrepancies were discussed with senior authors. Further details regarding the search strategy are summarized in S1 Table.Eligibility criteriaThis study included cohort studies using predetermined inclusion criteria including: (1) patients with coronary or non-coronary stents, (2) reporting NLR values, (3) investigating the diagnostic accuracy of NLR in predicting ISR or assessed NLR as a prognostic factor, (4) written in English. The definition of ISR was more than 50% restenosis of the previously stented site [7]. Neutrophil lymphocyte ratio defined as the ratio of measured neutrophil and lymphocyte determined by each study. Records with inappropriate study design (case reports, case series, editorials, protocols, and conference abstracts), no available full-text articles, and literature not written in English. Further details regarding eligibility criteria are presented in S2 Table.Data extractionFrom the included studies, we extracted the following data: first authors name and publication year, study characteristics such as study period, duration of follow-up, study design, country, and lab brand; patient characteristics such as population, sample size, age, sex, comorbidities, timing of blood workup (pre-procedural vs post-procedural), stent location (coronary vs non-coronary stent); and the investigated outcome, which were predictive test metric (true positive [TP], false negative [FN], true negative [TN], false positive [FP]). Whenever the included studies did not provide these metrics, we followed the University of Oxford Centre of Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM) guideline [8], by transforming the available sensitivity, specificity, and the number of participants in the study to generate the sought variables. The duration of follow-up was further categorized into early ISR (≤1 year) and late ISR (>1 year) [6]. The coronary stent location refers to any stent implanted in the coronary arteries, while the non-coronary stent location refers to any stent implanted in the central and peripheral arteries. Two independent authors systematically extracted the relevant data using a pre-piloted form through Microsoft Excel® 2019 MSO. Any disagreements during the process were discussed through consensus with the senior author (S6 Table).Quality assessmentTwo authors independently conducted the methodological quality assessment using the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool [9] and Quality Assessment of Prognostic Accuracy Studies (QUAPAS) tool [10], which assessed six bias domains including study participation, study attrition, prognostic factor measurement, outcome measurement, study confounding, and statistical analysis and reporting. Details on each signaling question of the QUIPS tool are presented in S3 Table. Discrepancies between reviewers were resolved through discussion with senior reviewer. Studies were rated as having low, moderate, or high risk of bias in each domain, and an overall quality score was assigned. This comprehensive quality assessment ensured that only high-quality studies contributed to our final analysis, enhancing the reliability of our findings. The results of the quality assessment are detailed in S4 Table.Statistical analysisAll statistical analyses were performed using R software version 4.3.2 (Posit PBC, USA) with the “meta” and “mada” packages to estimate the pooled sensitivity and specificity using a bivariate meta-analysis. This analysis employed the Rutter and Gatsonis hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) parameterization model [11]. Individual study estimates were visualized using Review Manager 5.4, which generated a summary receiver operating characteristics (sROC) curve visualizing the 95% confidence regions (CRs) and summary points while simultaneously obtaining the area under the curve (AUC). AUC values were interpreted as follows: 0.50–0.60 (failed), 0.60–0.70 (poor), 0.70–0.80 (fair), 0.80–0.90 (good), and ≥ 0.90 (excellent). To explore sources of heterogeneity, we performed subgroup analysis based on study region, sample size, study design, blood workup, follow-up period. For multivariate analysis, we summarized adjusted odds ratio to analyze the risk estimates and linear relationship between NLR and ISR using at random-effects meta-analysis mode. Heterogeneity was quantified using I2 and chi-square. To examine publication bias, funnel plots and Egger’s tests were conducted when the pooled analysis incorporated more than ten studies. The p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant in all analyses.ResultsStudy selectionInitially, our study managed to collectively gather 950 studies upon electronic searching of the databases. Two hundred and forty duplicates were subsequently removed. In accordance with the predefined criteria, 680 articles were excluded during the title and abstract screening. Among the screened articles, three were excluded due to inappropriate study designs (review articles and conference abstracts) [12,13], written in non-English [14], and three due to irretrievable full text articles [15–17]. Further, eight articles were excluded due to reporting outcome of interest [18–25]. Finally, 15 studies were considered as eligible for further analysis for this study [6,26–39]. The PRISMA flow diagram recorded thoroughly the inclusion and exclusion of the articles (Fig 1 and S1 Fig).10.1371/journal.pone.0322461.g001Fig 1PRISMA flow diagram of the study selection process.Study characteristicsA total of 3 889 patients from observational retrospective [26–28,30,34–36,39] and prospective [6,29,31–33] studies were included. These studies were conducted in Asia [6,26–28,31,34,35,37–39] and Europe [29,30,32,33,36]. Regarding stent location, eight of which are coronary stent procedures [28–30,32,34–36] and seven of which are non-coronary stent procedures [6,26,27,33,38–40], including stent in the femoropopliteal arteries, carotid arteries, superficial femoral artery, and intracranial arteries. Each individual study presented varying cut-off values to determine the optimal sensitivity and specificity. Details for studies characteristics were visualized in Fig 2 and S7 Table. The quality assessment for each individual study showed that all included articles had a low-to-moderate risk of bias (8 studies and 7 studies, respectively). Further details regarding baseline characteristics of included studies were summarized in S5 Table.10.1371/journal.pone.0322461.g002Fig 2Forest Plot Illustrating the Study-specific Sensitivity and Specificity of the Included Studies in Predicting ISR.Prognostic value and linear relationship of nlr in predicting coronary ISRThere were seven studies of 2 392 participants reporting data of risk for ISR. High value of NLR were linked to 60% increased odds of ISR (aOR = 1.60, 95%CI 1.14–2.25) (Fig 2), with a high level of heterogeneity (I2 = 88%) (S8b Table and S8 Fig). An aOR of 1.30 (95%CI 1.09–1.54) were found to be the value of NLR per unit in predicting ISR (S11 Table). The leave-one-out sensitivity analysis showed no significant reduction in heterogeneity and subgroup analysis failed to explore potential causes of heterogeneity. The summary and leave-one-out sensitivity analysis were visualized in S2 Fig. Publication bias analysis of Begg’s funnel plot and Egger’s regression test were not performed due to lack of required number of studies.Predictive value of nlr in predicting coronary ISRTo predict coronary ISR, six studies of 1 885 patients were considered as appropriate for analysis, and was found that NLR has a value of sensitivity and specificity of 70.5% (95%CI 60.1–79.2) and 74.1% (95%CI 56.7–86.2), respectively. The summary ROC curve (presented in Fig 4) showed pooled AUC of 0.77 (95%CI 0.70–0.82) and relatively narrow 95%CR. Other predictive measures analyzed were positive likelihood ratio (PLR) of 2.84 (1.75–4.56), negative likelihood ratio (NLR) of 0.41 (0.32–0.50), and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) of 7.12 (4.02–11.50) (S8a Table and S10 Table).10.1371/journal.pone.0322461.g003Fig 3Forest Plot Illustrating Study-specific and Overall Adjusted Odds Ratio of NLR in Predicting Coronary (a) and Non Coronary (b) ISR.10.1371/journal.pone.0322461.g004Fig 4Summary receiver operator characteristic (sROC) curve of overall NLR for predicting ISR.A sub-analysis was performed to evaluate how the parameter estimates of the variable influenced the predictor's performance, as shown in Table 1. NLR has a higher pooled sensitivity to predict late than early coronary ISR (early vs late 60.7% (95%CI 29.6–85.0) vs 73.4% (95%CI 68.5–77.9), Psensitivity = .156). Notably, NLR possesses higher specificity to predict early compared to late coronary ISR (early vs late 87.3% (95%CI 44.3–98.3) vs 62.3% (95%CI 49.1–73.9), Pspecificity = .118), although statistically insignificant. Additionally, NLR exhibits an AUC of 0.78 (95%CI 0.51–0.94) and 0.73 (95%CI 0.63–0.80), subsequently, to predict early and late coronary ISR. Study by Turak et al. (2012) [36], did not mention follow-up period specifically, therefore not included in the predictive follow-up period subanalysis. According to the stent type, NLR has a sensitivity of 67.6% (95%CI 45.2–84.1), specificity of 79.8% (95%CI 41.1–95.7), and AUC of 0.77 (95%CI 0.62–0.89) to predict ISR in DES sensitivity of 75.0% (95%CI 65.8–82.4), specificity of 71.8% (95%CI 67.2–76.0), and AUC of 0.78 (0.69–0.84).10.1371/journal.pone.0322461.t001Table 1Summary of subgroup analyses of predictive tests.SubgroupNumber of StudiesSensitivity (95% CI)Specificity (95% CI)AUC (95%CI)PSensitivityPSpecificity\nCORONARY STENT\nRegion (S4 Fig)Asia[34,35,37]373.5 (65.9-79.8)69.0 (62.7-74.8)0.77 (0.67-0.82)0.5790.519Europe[29,30,36]367.6 (45.2-84.1)79.8 (41.1-95.7)0.77 (0.62-0.89)Sample Size (S5 Fig)Small (n < 150)[37]175.0 (57.0-89.0)70.0 (58.0-81.0)0.80 (0.71-0.89)0.7350.844Large (n ≥ 150)[29,30,34–36]569.9 (57.4-79.9)75.1 (53.3-88.8)0.78 (0.69-0.83)Study Design (S3 Fig)Cohort retrospective[30,34–37]576.0 (71.7-79.9)66.6 (57.3-74.7)0.78 (0.71-0.82)\n\n0.000\n\n\n*\n\n\n\n0.001\n\n\n*\n\nCohort prospective[29]145.5 (35.4-55.395.8 (88.5-98.3)0.77 (0.70-0.83)Follow Up Period (S7 Fig)Early[29,37]460.7 (29.6-85.0)87.3 (44.3-98.3)0.78 (0.53-0.94)0.1560.118Late[30,34,35]573.4 (68.5-77.9)62.3 (49.1-73.9)0.73 (0.64-0.80)\nStent Type\nBare Metal Stent[29,30,36]367.6 (45.2-84.1)79.8 (41.1-95.7)0.77 (0.62-0.89)0.5740.689Drug Eluting Stent[34,37]275.0 (65.8-82.4)71.8 (67.2-76.0)0.78 (0.69-0.84)\nNON-CORONARY STENT\nRegion (S4 Fig)Asia[6,27,38]376.4 (67.6-83.5)70.9 (52.8-84.2)0.79 (0.69-0.86)0.5920.285Europe[33]181.3 (64.1-91.3)50.8 (38.6-62.8)0.63 (0.66-0.81)Sample Size (S6 Fig)Small (n < 150)[27,33]281.0 (68.9-89.2)51.8 (43.5-60.1)0.68 (0.49-0.85)0.342\n\n0.000\n\n\n*\n\nLarge (n ≥ 150)[6,38]274.6 (66.0-81.6)78.1 (72.4-82.9)0.83 (0.71-0.87)Study Design (S3 Fig)Cohort prospective[6,33,38]376.6 (67.7-83.7)70.5 (51.1-84.5)0.79 (0.69-0.86)0.6750.366Cohort retrospective[27]180.1 (61.3-91.8)52.7 (41.4-63.8)0.67 (0.74-0.82)Follow-Up Period (S7 Fig)Early[6,38]274.6 (66.0-81.6)78.1 (72.4-82.9)0.83 (0.72-0.87)0.342\n\n0.000\n\n\n*\n\nLate[27,33]281.0 (68.9-89.2)51.8 (43.5-60.1)0.68 (0.49-0.85)*p < 0.05 statistically significantPrognostic value and linear relationship of nlr in predicting non -coronary ISRA total of 1 285 subjects from 7 studies were analyzed, showing in non-coronary stenting NLR has an aOR of 1.69 (95%CI 1.52–1.87), with a low heterogeneity between the studies (I2 = 27%) (Fig 3B). A linear relationship of per unit NLR with an aOR 1.44 (95%CI 1.20–1.73) for ISR (S9 Fig). Begg’s funnel plot and Egger’s regression test of publication bias were not performed due to a limited number of studies.Predictive value of nlr in predicting non-coronary ISRFour studies were considered appropriate for analysis, resulting in 594 populations to be analyzed. The finding presented a pooled predictive estimate of: sensitivity, 77.7% (95%CI 69.8–84.0); specificity, 66.4% (95%CI 49.6–79.8); PLR: 2.39 (95%CI 1.60–3.60); NLR: 0.34 (95%CI 0.26–0.45); DOR: 7.21 (95%CI 3.60–12.60). The SROC curve visualized a relatively narrow 95%CR with an AUC value of 0.79 (95%CI 0.70–0.84).Subgroup analysis indicated that in predicting early ISR in the non-coronary stenting, NLR possessed a sensitivity of 74.6% (95%CI 66.0–81.6), specificity of 78.1% (95%CI 72.4–82.9), and AUC of 0.83 (95%CI 0.71–0.87). For late ISR, the pooled measure was sensitivity of 81.0% (95%CI 68.9–89.2), specificity of 51.8% (95%CI 43.5–60.1), and AUC of 0.68 (95%CI 0.49–0.86). A statistically significant difference in predictive performance was observed from specificity (Pspecificity < .001) rather than sensitivity (Psensitivity = .342). Sub-analysis for stent type cannot be done due to inappropriate data provided by the studies.DiscussionIn stent restenosis, defined as the re-narrowing of the more than 50% the previously stented vessel [41]. It remains as one of the most common and challenging problems for interventionists worldwide, despite advancements in stent technologies [42,43]. Predictive biomarkers are essential to facilitate risk stratification, enabling clinicians to implement timely and targeted interventions, in order to improve clinical outcomes [1,7].Coronary stentingThis study demonstrated that NLR provides a promising potential in predicting coronary ISR. In terms of coronary stenting, a high NLR has 1.6-fold of greater risk in having ISR, despite leave-one-out analysis and subgroup analysis cannot explained the potential cause of high heterogeneity, and an increase in per unit of NLR is equivalent of 30% increased odds of experiencing ISR. The result of this study aligns with previous studies, underscoring that ISR is a primarily atherosclerotic phenomenon characterized by neointimal hyperplasia within the stent [44–46]. Angkananard et al. (2018) reported similar results, showing that high NLR is associated with a 1.6-fold increased risk of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) [47].Under physiological conditions, neutrophils exert pro-inflammatory effects by secreting cytokines, while lymphocytes display anti-inflammatory properties, highlighting the role of complementary immune pathways [48]. ISR is driven by endothelial injury from stent deployment, which triggers an inflammatory cascade that promotes vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition [49], leading to the development of neointimal hyperplasia [1,50]. The endothelial cells subsequently express adhesion molecules (e.g., ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and P-selectin) [51], resulting in the influx of the neutrophils and monocytes to the subendothelial space, thus accelerating neointimal growth [52]. Therefore, an increased neutrophil count can foresee the progression of neointimal development [38]. Lymphocytes, as immunomodulator, responding to physiological stress, including cortisol, indicating that NLR has a significant predictive value in this clinical context [13].This theory is aligned with the result of this study, which indicates the promising performance of NLR in predicting ISR among stented patients. Numerous studies focusing on NLR also identify consistent results in predicting ISR, particularly in coronary stenting. The predictive performance of NLR for ISR is further supported by prior research, which has established NLR as a robust biomarker for coronary artery disease and adverse events following cardiovascular surgery [53,54]. Gordhanbhai et al., (2023) also demonstrated that NLR is beneficial in predicting severe stenosis of coronary arteries [55]. Köklü et al. (2016) also reported that NLR is a sufficient predictor of developing symptomatic plaque in patients with coronary artery disease [56]. Regardless of the type of stenting, this study demonstrate NLR has the same clinical benefit in both BMS and DES, although DES has shown to be more preferable in most clinical cases.When considering the time interval to ISR since stent placement, the current finding suggested that NLR has better accuracy in predicting early compared to late coronary ISR, although statistically insignificant. This can be explained by the fact that during the acute phase of ISR, neutrophils and monocytes adhere to the site of the injured vascular tissue, accompanied by the deposition of fibrin and platelets. Macrophages and giant cells then gradually take over within weeks as the process progresses [57].Non-coronary stentingOn the other hand, NLR also showed potential in predicting ISR in patients undergoing non-coronary stenting. Higher NLR faced 1.7 times the fold of ISR occurrence. Linear dose response relationship demonstrated 40% chance of having ISR per increase in one-unit NLR. The present result showed NLR possesses favorable predictive value. Further analysis revealed the usage of NLR is superior and in predicting early non coronary ISR, reflected by the number of overall AUC, than late non coronary ISR.A study by Russu et al. (2022) demonstrated that NLR to be valuable in predicting amputation rate and 12-month primary patency in PAD population [58]. In addition, Coelho et al. (2021) also demonstrated that higher NLR predicted a higher odd for 30-day mortality or amputation in patients with acute limb ischemia (ALI), as another form of atherosclerotic event [59]. These studies reinforce the relevance of NLR as a predictive marker for ISR across different vascular conditions, particularly in non-coronary stenting.Similar to coronary stenting, inflammation is also a critical factor in the development of ISR in non-coronary stenting including peripheral and carotid arteries, involving early-stage neointimal hyperplasia following arterial injury, where neutrophils play a critical role through the release of myeloperoxidase, matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), and free radicals, while certain lymphocyte subsets reduce inflammation. Following arterial stenting, platelet and fibrin accumulate around the stent, sparking acute inflammation initially, which transitions to a granulation tissue response involving neovascularization, smooth muscle cell migration, proliferation, and the gradual replacement of acute inflammatory cells with chronic ones [60]. Recent evidence suggests that the inflammatory response following vascular interventions differs by procedure type. Scalise et al. (2025) [61] found that carotid endarterectomy (CEA) elicits a stronger inflammatory reaction than carotid artery stenting (CAS), as evidenced by elevated levels of inflammatory biomarkers post-surgery. High levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and fibrinogen were identified as predictors of early restenosis, emphasizing the critical role of inflammation in vascular healing and ISR.Patients with in-stent restenosis (ISR) and a high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) are more likely to have soft plaque, which facilitates guide wire passage but is prone to rupture or dislodgement. Davies et al. (2010) found that soft plaque, combined with elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), is a key predictor of ISR. Additionally, patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and high NLR have increased inflammation and a higher risk of acute coronary events. During superficial femoral artery interventions, 3.8% of patients experienced distal embolization, likely due to soft plaque fragmentation from balloon angioplasty [62]. Therefore, the NLR could be an objective tool for predicting the complexity of ISR, assisting physicians in developing strategies to enhance operational efficiency and reduce distal embolization.Notably, this predictive power of NLR persisted despite some patients receiving anti-inflammatory statin therapy [63]. It is speculated that NLR correlates with plaque stability, predicting risks like distal embolism during procedures. This theory suggests that patients with ISR and higher NLR may have softer plaques, which easier for guiding wires to navigate, but also prone to rupture or dislodge more easily [64]. Additionally, it is important to consider the role of omics science in the identification of biomarkers for ISR. Costa et al. (2024) [65] reported that advanced omics technologies have identified critical genetic and proteomic markers associated with restenosis, providing a precision medicine approach to vascular interventions in detecting inflammatory responses, plaque vulnerability, and restenosis risk [65].This study has certain limitations. First, included studies were conducted in Asia and Europe, suggesting that our findings may not be broadly applicable to other populations and ethnicities. Second, there is a relative paucity of studies investigating the role of NLR among patients with non-coronary stents, warranting further research in this area. Third, a high heterogeneity was observed in this study, with only stent location and study region partially explaining the source of heterogeneity. However, to the best of our knowledge, this systematic review and meta-analysis is the first to evaluate the predictive value of NLR and ISR among both coronary and non-coronary stents. Additionally, our findings suggest that NLR is a promising biomarker that can be potentially utilized in the future, possessing a high predictive and prognostic value and supporting its potential integration into routine clinical practice for risk stratification and personalized management strategies.ConclusionIn conclusion, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a promising biomarker for predicting in-stent restenosis (ISR) in both coronary and non-coronary stent placements. Additionally, NLR appears to be more proficient in predicting early ISR compared to late ISR in both coronary and non-coronary stents. These findings highlight the clinical utility of NLR in guiding post-stent surveillance strategies, though further prospective studies are warranted to validate its prognostic accuracy and optimize its clinical application.Supporting informationS1 FileSupplementary figures, tables, and other details supporting the systematic review and meta-analysis of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in predicting in-stent restenosis (ISR); including search strategy (S1 Table), eligibility criteria (S2 Table), QUIPS signalling questions (S3 Table), risk of bias assessments (S4a–S4b Tables), study inclusion & exclusion criteria (S5 Table), data sources (S6 Table), data extraction details (S7 Table), statistical results (S8a–S8b Tables), additional tables (S9–S11 Tables), and figures (S1–S9 Figures).(DOCX)"}

Different combinations of DES were directly compared with permanent-polymer sirolimus-eluting stents. The primary outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events; a composite of cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), and target vessel revascularization. A network meta-analysis was performed to determine the net relative risk (RR) and its 95% CI.ResultsA total of 314 randomized control trials comprising 345,749 patients with coronary artery disease undergoing PCI were included. Compared with polymer-permanent sirolimus-eluting stent, polymer-free titanium-nitride-oxide (RR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.53-0.87), polymer-permanent everolimus (RR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.82-0.96), and zotarolimus stents (RR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.79-0.99) had a lower risk of major adverse cardiovascular events at 5 years. Polymer-free titanium-nitride-oxide stents also had a significantly lower incidence of stent thrombosis (RR: 0.28; 95% CI: 0.13-0.59) and MI (RR: 0.41; 95% CI: 0.27-0.62) at 1 year. Bare metal stents had a significantly higher 1-year risk of MI (RR: 1.52; 95% CI: 1.25-1.86), and need for target vessel revascularization (RR: 2.26; 95% CI: 1.93-2.64).ConclusionsIn comparison with polymer-permanent sirolimus, the newer stents including polymer-free titanium-nitride-oxide, polymer-permanent everolimus, and zotarolimus stents significantly reduce the risk of long-term ischemic events.", "body": "Bare-metal stents (BMS) demonstrated superiority over balloon angioplasty in preventing restenosis by addressing vascular recoil and remodeling.1 However, their effectiveness was limited by neointimal hyperplasia. The development of drug-eluting stents (DES), which incorporate antiproliferative agents like sirolimus and paclitaxel within a permanent polymer coating, marked a significant advancement, reducing tissue proliferation and in-stent restenosis.2, 3, 4, 5 Despite these benefits, polymer-coated DES posed risks such as delayed endothelialization by the antirestenotic drugs and hypersensitivity reaction to the polymer coating.6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 To address these challenges, DES generations introduced biodegradable polymer and polymer-free coatings alongside highly potent antiproliferative drugs. Additionally, newer generation titanium-nitride-oxide (TiNO)–coated stents emerged with improved biocompatibility. These stents, often referred to as bioactive stents, evolved as a cobalt-chromium, thin-strutted coated with an ultrathin metallic layer that exposes nitric oxide molecules toward the vascular lumen.13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18While numerous randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses have examined DES and polymer types, a comprehensive evaluation comparing different DES generations across polymer types, factoring in antiplatelet therapy duration, clinical presentation, and follow-up, remains lacking.MethodsThe current network meta-analysis (NMA) was conducted in adherence to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist (Supplemental Table 1).Search strategyPubMed, Cochrane, and Embase databases were searched up to January 2024 using Boolean operators and MeSH terms. Screening was conducted at the title and abstract level, with full-text appraisal and data extraction for relevant studies. References of included randomized control trials (RCTs) were assessed via backward snowballing. Details of the search strategy are provided in the supplementary appendix. This study was exempted from Institutional Review Board/ethics committee approval as data were obtained from previously published studies.Selection criteria and study subjectsIncluded RCTs compared DES and BMS, focused on post-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) all-comers with stable angina or acute coronary syndrome (ACS), reported at least one efficacy outcome and had follow-up durations of 6 months to 5 years. Studies with duplicate populations, incomplete data on stent type or follow-up, reviews, conference papers, and case reports were excluded.Comparison strategiesThe included RCTs were categorized into 4 major strategies: BMS, polymer-free, polymer-absorbable, and polymer-permanent DES. The latter 3 were further divided into 18 subgroups based on the eluting drug. The common control arm was polymer permanent sirolimus-eluting stents.Study outcomesThe primary outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE); a composite of cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), and target vessel revascularization (TVR). Secondary endpoints included individual components of MACE, all-cause mortality, stent thrombosis (ST), and target lesion revascularization (TLR).Statistical analysisNMA was performed using a frequentist random effects model to analyze mixed treatment comparisons. Network geometry illustrated comparison strategies, with open and closed loops indicating indirect and direct comparisons, respectively. The prerequisites of NMA (similarity and transitivity) were satisfied by detailed scrutinization of trial-level methodology. Loop and global consistency of the summary estimates was statistically validated and a P value >0.05 suggested no evidence of inconsistency. The design- and study-level estimates were illustrated using intervals and the network forest plots. Minimal parallelism and mean path length visualized net effect size and indirect evidence, respectively. Treatment ranking was determined using surface under the cumulative ranking, where values closer to 1 indicated superior performance. Subgroup analyses were conducted by clinical presentation, follow-up duration, and dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) duration. Sensitivity analysis using the “leave-one-out” method evaluated the impact of individual studies.Trial sequential analysis (TSA) evaluated the power and summary estimate stability. The former was confirmed when the accrued cumulative effect size (Z-curve) reached either the O'Brien–Fleming monitoring boundary or the required information size. The trend of evidence was unlikely to alter, if the z-score curve crossed the futility boundary. Required information size was calculated for 80% power (β = 0.20) and a P value of 0.05, based on MACE incidences of 13.77% and 14.83% and all-cause mortality incidences of 8.26% and 9.28% for intervention and control groups, respectively.Higgins's I-squared statistics and L'Abbé plots were used to assess heterogeneity in the pairwise estimates, while Egger's regression equation and funnel plots were used for publication bias. Analysis was performed using Copenhagen Trial Unit, STATA v16 (STATACORP LLC v16), and R v4.01 (R Foundation v4.01).ResultsSearch resultsA comprehensive literature search identified 11,716 items, reduced to 9,460 after duplicates removal. 8,326 records that did not qualify the selection criteria were removed after screening the title and abstracts. 1,134 full-text articles were reviewed, of which 314 (196 primary, 118 secondary) RCTs qualified for quantitative analysis (Supplemental Figures 1 and 2). The relative contribution and relevance of treatment regimens are illustrated in the network geometry (Figure 1).Figure 1Network of Treatments Indicating Direct and Indirect Treatment ComparisonsThe size of the node represents the number of studies and thickness of line represent the amount of relevant data.

Among the experimental group, the proportions of major stent types were as follows: polymer-permanent everolimus (26%), polymer-permanent zotarolimus (22%), BMS (7.5%), polymer-permanent paclitaxel (4.3%), and polymer-free TiNO (1.9%). In the control arm, sirolimus-eluting stents accounted for 55% of patients (n = 93,616). The mean age of the study population was 62 ± 10 years, with 72% males. The prevalence of hypertension and other traditional risk factors of CAD were frequent in comparison groups.

The 6-month, 1-year, and 5-year risk of MACE remained higher in patients receiving polymer-permanent paclitaxel and BMS. There was no significant difference in the incidence of MACE between all other DES types at all timepoints (Figure 2, Table 2).

At 6 months, polymer-permanent everolimus stents (RR: 0.34; 95% CI: 0.13-0.88) had a significantly lower risk of ST. BMS had a higher risk of MI, and risk for TLR and TVR (Supplemental Figure 5). At 1-year, polymer-free TiNO, polymer-permanent everolimus stents, and polymer-absorbable sirolimus stents had a significantly lower, while BMS had a significantly higher risk of ST, and MI compared with polymer-permanent sirolimus stents. Patients undergoing PCI with BMS continued to have a higher risk of TLR (RR: 3.02; 95% CI: 2.34-3.89) and TVR (RR: 2.26; 95% CI: 1.93-2.64) (Supplemental Figure 6). At 5 years, polymer-free TiNO (RR: 0.56; 95% CI: 39-0.82) and polymer-absorbable sirolimus stents (RR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.68-0.98) had a significantly lower risk of MI, while polymer-permanent everolimus stents had a significantly lower risk of ST (RR: 0.44; 95% CI: 0.30-0.67), risk of TLR (RR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.76-0.97) and TVR (RR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.77-0.99). Similarly, polymer-absorbable sirolimus stents had a lower risk of ST (RR: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.30-0.80) and BMS remained to have a higher risk of TLR (RR: 2.09; 95% CI: 1.79-2.44) and TVR (RR: 1.59; 95% CI: 1.38-1.82) (Supplemental Figure 7). Nonetheless, the risk of stroke, CVD, and all-cause mortality remained nonsignificantly different in all stent comparisons at all timepoints (Supplemental Figures 5 to 7). The contribution of direct and indirect evidence to the net estimates for primary and secondary endpoints at all timepoints is given in Supplemental Tables 5 to 17.Subgroup analysisA stratified analysis of 28 RCTs (24,320 patients; 12,251 experimental, 12,069 control) of all comers based on the duration of DAPT (6 months vs 1 year) was also performed compared to polymer-permanent sirolimus stents. At 1 year, there was a similar risk of ST, MI, TVR, TLR, CVD, and all-cause mortality among all stent comparisons with polymer-permanent sirolimus stents, irrespective of DAPT duration (6 and 12 months), except that the risk of TLR and TVR was significantly higher with BMS and polymer-permanent paclitaxel stents (Supplemental Figures 8 and 9).In patients with ACS, a total of 18 RCTs comprising 15,783 (7,390 experimental, 8,393 control) were included. In concordance with the net results, the risk of MACE in all types of stents compared with polymer-permanent sirolimus stents was similar, except for patients undergoing PCI with polymer-free TiNO, who had a lower 1-year risk of MI (RR: 0.34; 95% CI: 0.14-0.81) and ST (RR: 0.17; 95% CI: 0.07-0.42). Compared to polymer-permanent sirolimus stents, the relative risk of ST was lower with the use of polymer-permanent everolimus stents (RR: 0.45; 95% CI: 0.23-0.88) and the incidence of TLR higher with BMS (RR: 2.57; 95% CI: 1.33-4.99) and TVR (RR: 1.88; 95% CI: 1.44-2.46) (Supplemental Figure 10).Ranking of treatment strategiesPolymer-free TiNO was associated with the lowest risk of MACE at 1- (P-score 0.8306) and 5-year (P-score 0.9459). Polymer-free TiNO was also ranked the best for reducing the 1-year risk of MI (P-score 0.9641), ST (P-score 0.9655), and all-cause mortality (P-score 0.7275) followed by polymer-permanent everolimus stents. BMS and polymer-permanent paclitaxel stents had the worst ranking for all these outcomes (Figure 3, Supplemental Figures 1 and 12).Figure 3Rankogram for MACE for Experimental Vs Control ArmsMaximum P-score is 1 and scores closer to 1 represent the highest performance. Abbreviations as in Figures 1 and 2.Network consistency and heterogeneityOn NMA, there was no evidence of total (global), within-, and between-design (loop) inconsistency in MACE and all secondary outcomes (ST, MI, TLR, TVR, mortality, and CVD) (P > 005) at all timepoints (6 months, 1 and 5 years), except for TLR at 1 year that showed a significant within-design (P = 0.0002), loop (P = 0.036), and global inconsistency (P < 0.0001) (Supplemental Table 18). The within-design inconsistency was driven by the significant heterogeneity in the pairwise comparison of polymer-permanent everolimus, paclitaxel, and zotarolimus stents. L'abbe plot showed a symmetric distribution of studies on each side of the equality line, validating no heterogeneity (Supplemental Figure 13). The heatmap also showed minimal design-level inconsistency for MACE (Supplemental Figure 14).Sensitivity analysesThere was no major influence of any single RCT on net estimates of MACE and all-cause mortality (Supplemental Figure 15).Trial sequential analysisTSA further validated the nonsignificant differences in the risk of MACE and all-cause mortality between the experimental and polymer-permanent sirolimus stents direct comparison groups at the interim analyses of the included trials. TSA also elucidated that statistically significant differences in the incidence of MACE between the comparison strategies are not expected with future RCTs as the cumulative Z-line crossed the futility area (Figure 4A). Similarly, the all-cause mortality findings were conclusive because the calculated cumulative estimates surpassed the information size (Figure 4B).Figure 4Red Vertical Line at the Right End Indicates the Required Information Size (Total Population), to Detect a Relative Risk Difference (RRD) of Direct Comparison Strategies With PP-SES at an Allowable Alpha Error of 5% and Power of 80%The black vertical line on the left side shows the scale of the cumulative z-score, where |Z| = 1.96 corresponds to a P = 0.05. The black central horizontal line represents the interim addition of RCTs in a chronological fashion. The green horizontal lines on each side signify the conventional boundaries for measured 95% CIs. The red dotted lines on each outer side of the conventional boundaries that taper toward the axis of the information size represent the monitoring boundaries of TSA (inward sloping), while the red dotted lines inside the conventional boundaries (outward sloping) represent the futility boundaries. The solid blue line represents the calculated cumulative point estimate (Z-curve) with each dot indicating a change in the net estimate with the addition of the new RCT. (A) The required information size to detect or reject a 1.96% RRD with a major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) incidence of 14.83% in the PP-SES was 92,109. The TSA crossed the area of futility (outward red line slope), suggesting that the addition of future trials on pp-ses will unlikely reach the threshold of statistical significance. (B) The required information size to detect or reject the RRD with a mortality incidence of 9.28% in PP-SES was 33,409. With the addition of the SORT-OUT-II trial, the cumulative z line surpassed the required information size suggesting that sufficient evidence on mortality has been achieved. RCTs = randomized control trials; SES = sirolimus-eluting stent; TSA = trial sequential analysis; other abbreviation as in Figure 1.Publication biasThe risk of publication bias for both MACE and mortality was low both by the visual criterion of symmetry of the funnel plots and by nonsignificant ERE (P = 0.80 and P = 0.99, respectively) (Supplemental Figure 16).DiscussionThe current network demonstrates the following. 1) Compared with the control group, permanent-polymer everolimus and polymer-free TiNO stents were associated with 11%, and 22% lower 5-year risk of MACE, respectively. 2) The former was also associated with a lower 5-year risk of ST and the need for revascularization. 3) Polymer-free TiNO had the highest efficacy in terms of the lowest risk of ST and MI. 4) BMS had a greater risk of ST and MI, and a higher need for TLR and TVR irrespective of clinical presentation, DAPT duration, and follow-up periods. 5) A sequential analysis suggested that future RCTs on direct comparisons of polymer-permanent sirolimus stents are not required; both for incidence of MACE (as it is implausible that the aggregated estimates could become statistically significant) and all-cause mortality (because the required sample size for superiority is already obtained).Prior studies on the utility of different stent designs have shown that delayed vascular healing is the major determinant of ST, contributing to the overall risk of adverse events after stent implantation.19,20 Recent advancements in DES were focused on the reduction of implantation-related vascular injury, polymer-associated inflammation, and stent-induced thrombosis. In our study, different stent strategies were directly or indirectly compared with each other and with the control group (polymer-permanent sirolimus stents). On a weighted estimate of 125 RCTs, polymer-permanent everolimus stents showed an impressive performance in terms of lowering the incidence of ST. A significant reduction in the risk of ST was evident as early as within 6 months, with no thrombotic late catch-up phenomenon thereafter up to 5 years. These benefits ultimately translated into a substantially lower incidence of pooled ischemic events, and need for revascularization at 5 years, not only compared with BMS but also with first-generation DES such as polymer-permanent sirolimus and paclitaxel stents. This suggests that a durable and relatively thinner fluoropolymer used in polymer-permanent everolimus stents might be “thromboresistant” and more biocompatible than first-generation polymers.21,22 Apart from this, better stent geometry and uniform coating of drugs presumably enabled a sustained release of antiproliferative drugs, favoring polymer-permanent everolimus stents over older-generation stents.22In our study, the lower incidence of MACE and secondary efficacy endpoints at long-term follow-up with the next-generation polymer-free TiNO-coated stents appeared to be driven by the TIDE-ACS (Thin-strut DES in Extended duration dual antiplatelet therapy in Acute Coronary Syndrome), TiNOX (Titanium-Nitride-Oxide-coated stents in ACS), and TiTAX (Titanium-Nitride-Oxide Coated Stent versus TAXUS Drug-Eluting Stent) trials.13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 Mechanistically, these benefits could be explained by the use of a cobalt-chromium platform with ultrathin struts that have improved radial strength, lower risk of platelet adhesion, and reduced fibrinogen binding.13 The other plausible explanation for better outcomes in polymer-free TiNO would be the use of polymer-free instead of polymer-coated surface for drug adherence, allowing for earlier endothelialization and decreased inflammatory and thrombogenic responses to the polymer.23 In TIDES-ACS trials, intravascular imaging of patients treated with TiNO-coated stents showed a lower percentage of uncovered and malapposed struts but had more risk of intimal hyperplasia. The latter findings might be responsible for the relatively higher risk of revascularization with polymer-free TiNO. Nevertheless, the higher rate of revascularization could be considered a trade-off for the substantially lower incidence of ST and repeat MI events seen with these stents. Overall, these findings should be interpreted with caution, as only 6 trials contributed to the comparison, the included trials did not perform routine angiographic follow-up, and were underpowered to assess individual efficacy endpoints, potentially overestimating the net results.Similar to polymer-free TiNO and polymer-permanent everolimus stents, sirolimus stents coated on bioabsorbable polymers showed a substantial reduction in the ST and MI events at both 1 and 5 years, compared with a similar eluting drug (sirolimus) coated on nondegradable polymer. These benefits clearly indicate that polymer-coating has a crucial role in the pathogenesis of ST and subsequent hard clinical outcomes. This attests that bioabsorbable polymer coatings preserve the efficacy of permanent coatings during the initial phase, providing higher antirestenotic properties, whereas simultaneously offering the safety of BMS (lower thrombogenicity) after the polymer dissolves.24 Although our net estimates favored polymer absorbable sirolimus stents over polymer-permanent sirolimus stents, the significance of P values was only modest in its statistical power, resulting in a nonsignificant difference in the primary composite endpoint, and the need for revascularization between the 2 stent designs.The other 16 stent strategies showed a similar risk of primary ischemic endpoint and most of the secondary endpoints on all different comparisons. Lastly, the BMS and polymer-permanent paclitaxel stents persistently ranked the worst strategies due to a 1- to 3-fold higher incidence of ST, MI, and the need for revascularization at all timepoints. The results of the current study were concordant based on several subgroups and sensitivity analyses.Our study expands the findings of previous meta-analyses that had conflicting findings. Importantly, previous analyses lacked stratification of outcomes based on clinical presentation, DAPT duration, and polymer type (Supplemental Table 19). By contrast, using 19 different stent types, our study is the most comprehensive analysis of 3 major polymer types, BMS and a myriad of DES. In a nutshell, we found that new-generation antiproliferative drug coating on the durable polymer (everolimus stents) or potentially on a polymer-free surface (TiNO) run in parallel with a reduction of definite ST rates, compared with old-generation polymer-permanent sirolimus stents and BMS.Study LimitationsThe findings of our study should be interpreted with consideration of certain limitations. The inherent methodological variations across the included RCTs, such as differences in patient populations, timing of randomization, medication compliance, and outcome measurement may introduce bias in the pooled analysis. Although larger-scale trials were selected for subgroup analyses, the risk of type 1 error remains, as multiple comparisons increase the likelihood of false positive findings. Due to a limited number of studies, we couldn't determine the safety of novel stents in the setting of de-escalation therapies (<6-month DAPT). There were some sample size differences in the experimental and control arms of some of the included trials resulting in wide credibility intervals and imprecise estimates that should be interpreted with caution. Due to the lack of head-to-head comparisons of polymer-free TiNO with most of the older generation DES, we had to rely on our indirect estimates; however, the lack of significant inconsistency supports the reliability of our net results. While the new-generation polymer-free TiNO stents seem to have promising results in the initial trials, large-scale confirmatory trials are needed to validate these findings.ConclusionsAmong 19 different stent designs, permanent-polymer everolimus and zotarolimus use followed by DAPT for 12 months might be the best strategy to reduce the long-term incidence of ischemic events and the need for revascularizations in all comers. Polymer-free TiNO is emerging as a potentially safer and more efficacious strategy, particularly in ACS patients. BMS and paclitaxel-eluting stents might be considered outdated since they carry a higher overall risk of complications irrespective of DAPT duration and clinical presentation of patients.PerspectivesCOMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: In post-PCI patients, permanent-polymer everolimus and zotarolimus stents appear to have the highest efficacy due to a significantly lower risk of ischemic events compared with older-generation stents.TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Further studies are needed to determine the efficacy of TiNO stents.Funding support and author disclosuresThe authors have reported that they have no relationships relevant to the contents of this paper to disclose."}

An individual participant data meta-analysis from the INTERPRESS-IPD Collaboration", "abstract": "AbstractObjectivesTo determine associations between arm and ankle systolic blood pressures (SBPs), develop and validate a multivariable model predicting arm SBP from ankle SBP, and investigate associations between ankle SBP, cardiovascular disease and mortality.DesignAnkle-arm SBP differences were examined in two-stage individual participant data (IPD) meta-analyses using multivariable hierarchical linear regression models. Models were used to derive and validate a prediction model for arm SBP based on ankle SBP. Model performance was assessed using area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve analyses. Prognostic associations of ankle SBP with outcomes were examined using Cox proportional hazards models.Data sourcesSearches identified cohorts for the Inter-arm Blood Pressure Difference IPD (INTERPRESS-IPD) Collaboration from Medline, Old Medline, Medline in process, Embase and CINAHL databases from inception until January 2017; unpublished data were also sought. Required primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and/or fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events.Eligibility criteriaProspective studies from community, primary care or general clinic settings, without language restriction, that recorded SBP in both arms were eligible. Adults aged ≥18 years with SBP measured in all four limbs, in a supine position, were included in the current analyses. People with peripheral artery disease were excluded.Data extraction and synthesisAnonymised datasets were individually cleaned and then combined into a single dataset for the INTERPRESS-IPD Collaboration.ResultsThe current dataset included 33 710 participants from 14 studies; mean age 58 years, 45% female, mean baseline arm blood pressure 138/80 (SD: 20/12) mm Hg. Mean ankle SBP was 12.0 mm Hg (95% CI 8.8 to 15.2) higher than arm SBP. The multivariable model predicting arm SBP from ankle SBP demonstrated excellent performance (AUROC curves, sensitivities and specificities were >0.82, 0.80 and 0.82, respectively, at all BP thresholds from 130 to 160 mm Hg). Model performance was superior to existing arithmetic formulae.Ankle SBP was neither associated with all-cause nor cardiovascular mortality (HR 1.000 (0.997 to 1.002; p=0.682) and 1.001 (0.996 to 1.005; p=0.840), respectively). However, lower-reading ankle SBP was associated with fatal or non-fatal cardiovascular events (HR 1.005 (1.002 to 1.007; p<0.001).ConclusionsOn average, ankle SBP is 12 mm Hg higher than arm SBP. Estimating individual arm SBP from ankle SBP measurements with a multivariable model is more accurate than existing fixed arithmetic formulae. This model, operationalised in an online calculator (https://ablebp.research.exeter.ac.uk/), could facilitate hypertension management and cardiovascular care for people unable to have arm SBP measured.PROSPERO registration numberCRD42015031227.", "body": "STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDYThis is the largest study to date examining the relationship between arm and ankle blood pressure (BP) using individual participant data (IPD) meta-analyses.We have created a novel model, using IPD meta-analysis methods, to estimate arm systolic BP from ankle systolic BP; this approach proved superior to existing estimation methods.Our prediction model is freely available for use within a web-based calculator online (https://ablebp.research.exeter.ac.uk/).IPD meta-analysis can overcome limitations associated with study-level aggregate meta-analyses; however, in this study, heterogeneity still existed and was not explained by sensitivity analyses, so generalisation of results should be undertaken with caution.Despite using an international dataset with over 33 000 individuals, further validation of our models in ethnicities and specialised populations (particularly those with limb deformity or loss) not currently represented is required.Introduction Blood pressure (BP) is, by convention and for convenience, primarily measured on the upper arm; international hypertension guidelines rely entirely on such measurements.13 However, arm (brachial) BP measurement is not always feasible. Approximately 13 people per 100 000 population have upper limb prostheses in the UK, and over 1700 amputations above wrist level occur each year.4 Arm BP measurement may not be possible temporarily following multiple fractures, or permanently due to an upper arm amputation, morbid obesity, bilateral lymphoedema, phocomelia, or altered muscle tone and hemiplegia following stroke.57 BP measurement may also be unreliable in the presence of bilateral arterial stenoses due to atheroma or arteritides.8 People living with phocomelia or amputation carry additional cardiovascular risks compared with the general population, emphasising their need for careful management of risk factors such as high BP.7 9 When arm measurement is not feasible, leg (ankle) BP measurement is recommended as an alternative.10 Multiple conversion guidelines exist, creating uncertainty over how to best interpret ankle BP measurements; both subtraction and multiplication conversions to equivalent arm pressures have been proposed; these all take a ‘one size fits all’ approach, assuming that the ankle-arm BP relationship is constant (box 1).7 10 11Box 1Current conversion methods for ankle to arm blood pressuresExisting proposals for adjusting ankle blood pressure (BP) measurements to equivalent brachial blood pressure values:Multiply (ankle systolic BP+8)×0.88 (Shiga et al7).Deduct 10/5 mm Hg from ankle systolic/diastolic BP (Thalidomide Trust).Deduct 15 mm Hg from ankle systolic; diastolic is unchanged (British and Irish Hypertension Society).Reported differences between ankle and arm systolic BPs (SBPs), defined as ankle minus arm BP, range from 10 to 40 mm Hg in healthy participants.12 13 Our previous study-level systematic review and meta-analysis of 9771 participants from 44 general population studies reported a pooled mean ankle-arm difference in SBP of 17.0 mm Hg (95% CI 15.4 to 21.3 mm Hg); diastolic BP (DBP) difference was −0.3 mm Hg (95% CI −1.5 to 1.0 mm Hg).14 Consequently, we concluded that an ankle BP of 155/90 mm Hg could be broadly equated to the current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) arm threshold of 140/90 mm Hg.2Within that review, we found substantial residual heterogeneity between studies, suggesting that a single conversion factor may not have equal utility across the full range of participants’ likely ankle BPs and characteristics. We hypothesised that an alternative multivariable modelling approach might improve the accuracy of individual arm BP estimation. The Inter-arm BP Difference Individual Participant Data (INTERPRESS-IPD) Collaboration includes over 33 000 participants with bilateral arm and ankle BP data.15 We used these data to establish the Arm Based on LEg BP (ABLE-BP) cohort, to overcome some limitations of study-level meta-analysis and: (1) examine the association between arm and ankle SBP, (2) derive and validate a model to estimate arm SBP based on ankle SBP and (3) explore the association between ankle SBP and cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality and all-cause mortality.MethodsThis IPD meta-analysis was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42015031227) and the protocol has been published.16 The study was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Individual Participant Data statement.17Literature search and study identificationEstablishment of the INTERPRESS-IPD Collaboration and of the ABLE-BP cohort have been previously described.16 18 In brief, we searched Medline, Old Medline, Medline in process, Embase and CINAHL from inception until January 2017 for eligible observational longitudinal studies or randomised controlled trials without BP lowering interventions. Required primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and/or fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events. We contacted the authors of studies identified as likely to hold published or unpublished data on participants with BP recorded in both arms to request access. The subset of our included studies that measured Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI), thus offering supine SBP measurements in four limbs, was eligible for inclusion in the ABLE-BP cohort. Initial data sharing agreements with study lead authors were extended to permit the current analyses. Participants were recruited from primary, community or general care settings and were aged ≥18 years. Participant and study-level characteristics known to relate to cardiovascular risk, including age, sex, ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, total and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, pre-existing cardiovascular diagnoses and methods of BP measurement were sought.BP measurementBP measurements were obtained sequentially from all four limbs according to ABI protocols lying supine following a rest period. If more than one sequence was recorded, values from the first sequence were used.15\nOnline supplemental table S4 details BP measurement methods and study-level characteristics.Data preparationEligible participants in the INTERPRESS-IPD dataset were combined into the new ABLE-BP cohort using Stata V.17.0 (StataCorp, Texas, USA). One potentially eligible study only recruited participants with an ABI≤0.95 and was excluded.19 Established peripheral artery disease (PAD) profoundly alters the relationship of leg to arm BP. Therefore, individual participants were excluded if they had PAD, an ABI<0.90, or lower reading ankle SBP<70 mm Hg or >250 mm Hg, such readings being diagnostic or highly indicative of PAD.20Statistical analysisDBP is not routinely recorded when measuring ABI and was not available in the INTERPRESS-IPD data, so all analyses examined SBP. We defined the difference between arm and ankle BP as the lower-reading posterior tibial artery SBP minus the higher-reading arm SBP using the first set of four-limb BP readings. Participant characteristics were described at study level, including age, sex, ethnic group, BMI, arm and ankle BP, smoking status, total and HDL cholesterol, and the presence of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease or ischaemic heart disease.The co-primary outcomes examined were: (1) the ankle-arm SBP difference and (2) arm SBP estimated from ankle SBP using multivariable modelling. We also examined: (3) the association between ankle SBP and all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality and non-fatal cardiovascular events (defined as first incidence of myocardial infarction, physician confirmed angina, coronary revascularisation, transient ischaemic attack or stroke). Where an association was detected, we examined the discriminative ability of existing cardiovascular disease (CVD) prediction models (Framingham and AtheroSclerotic CardioVascular Disease (ASCVD) 10-year risk scores) using estimated arm SBP.For the primary outcomes, multivariable models were developed using observed data only, restricted to participants with no missing data for any model variables (termed ‘complete cases’). Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 and tau2 statistics.21 22Arm and ankle BP differenceAnkle-arm SBP differences (using higher arm SBP) were reported for each study in two-stage meta-analyses to derive forest plots and assess heterogeneity. Study-level estimates of ankle-arm differences were adjusted for age, sex, BMI, ethnicity, higher-reading arm SBP, smoking status, total cholesterol, pre-existing hypertension, diabetes and CVDs prior to being pooled across studies. Candidate covariates for models were selected for known associations with outcomes and high availability within the INTERPRESS dataset. The association between baseline covariates and ankle-arm SBP was explored in univariable and multivariable models using hierarchical linear regression with a random effect for study.Estimating arm BP using ankle BPOne-stage (comprising hierarchical linear regression with a random effect for study) and two-stage meta-analyses were used to assess heterogeneity using complete case data for the candidate variables of age, sex, BMI, ethnicity, higher-reading arm SBP, smoking status, total cholesterol and medical history. The model was derived using data from a subset of studies (the derivation dataset: nine studies, n=21 304) and validated in the remainder (validation dataset: four studies, n=8784).23 Studies were purposively allocated to the derivation or validation datasets to ensure even distribution of sexes and geographical origin. Model fit was assessed using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC).24 A range of observed higher arm SBP thresholds, from 130 mm Hg to 160 mm Hg in increments of 5 mm Hg, was used to classify participants’ hypertensive status if equal to or greater than each threshold. Using these dichotomised variables, mixed logistic regression models, with a random effect for study, were performed at each threshold, using estimated arm SBP from the derivation cohort model as the predictor in each fitted model. This allowed prediction of the probability of being classed as hypertensive for that threshold, for both the derivation and validation cohorts. A series of area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve analyses were used to examine model discrimination for the prediction of hypertensive status at each threshold in the derivation and validation datasets.25 Furthermore, the optimal cut-point (on the probability scale) for the diagnosis of hypertension at each BP threshold (using a range of thresholds at 5 mm Hg increments from 130 mm Hg to 160 mm Hg) was estimated, along with sensitivity, specificity and AUROC at the estimated optimal cut-point; 95% CIs were derived by bootstrap (100 replications with replacement). Receiver operating characteristic curves were also used to compare the final estimation model to current arithmetic conversion methods for arm SBP from ankle SBP (box 1).Model calibration was assessed using calibration plots, and by estimating the calibration slope (based on a mixed linear model regressing observed higher-reading arm SBP on estimated arm SBP (a coefficient of 1 for the regression slope being ideal) and calibration in the large (intercept from same model; intercept of 0 being ideal). Using the derivation dataset, we performed internal-external cross validation (IECV) for the calibration slope by leaving out each study in turn and fitting the final model using only the remaining studies.26 For each excluded study in turn, we then regressed the observed higher-reading arm SBP on the estimated arm SBP derived from the model developed using the dataset that excluded that study. The beta coefficients from the regression models were then pooled using a random effects meta-analysis. We used 140 mm Hg and 160 mm Hg, NICE stage 1 and stage 2 hypertension diagnostic thresholds, to evaluate the models’ sensitivities and specificities in diagnosing hypertension.2 Due to our exclusion criterion (ankle SBP<70 mm Hg), the prediction of hypotension was outside the scope of our modelling.Association between ankle BP and CVDFor participants without pre-existing CVD, individual time-to-event models were used to examine the association between higher- or lower-reading ankle SBP and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, and for fatal or non-fatal cardiovascular events. One-stage random effects flexible parametric models failed to converge. Therefore, fixed effect one-stage Cox proportional hazards models were used, stratified by study, with ankle SBP as the main exposure, adjusted for the covariates described above.Finally, the effects of including model estimated arm SBP (from aim 2) in existing cardiovascular risk prediction models were examined. For this, we used the ASCVD and Framingham 10-year cardiovascular risk scores, comparing scores calculated using the model-estimated arm SBP with scores using observed arm SBP.27 28 Analyses were restricted to valid age ranges for each score (ASCVD: 40–79, Framingham: 20–79 years).Sensitivity analysesIn sensitivity analyses, each of the analyses described above was repeated following multiple imputation using chained equations of missing baseline data for participant characteristics and BP variables. All imputation models included participant characteristics and accounted for the study. Imputation models for baseline predictor variables to be included in time-to-event modelling included the event indicator and Nelson-Aalen estimate of the cumulative hazard derived from observed data.29 Missing outcome data for time-to-event models was not imputed. Imputation for models predictive of ankle-arm difference and higher-reading arm BP included the outcome variable within the imputation model. Planned sensitivity analyses examining height as a variable in the final models were not feasible due to the global absence of height data. Exploratory back calculation of missing ankle SBP from ABI records proved unreliable when compared with known ankle data; therefore, this was not pursued.Patient and public involvementThree public advisors with lived experience of barriers to measuring arm BP were fully integrated into the project management team, facilitated by KB. Advisors attended pre-meetings and project meetings, contributing to all project stages from protocol development through to dissemination of findings. Their contributions included aligning the project objectives with outcomes meaningful to patients, ensuring that patient and public views were represented, and that results were summarised in accessible formats.16ResultsFourteen studies contributed data to the ABLE-BP dataset (online supplemental figure S1).3043 Included studies originated from Europe (n=7), USA (n=6) and Sub-Saharan Africa (n=1); their details and inclusion criteria have been previously described (online supplemental tables S1–S4).16 Records for 33 710 participants contained at least one set of arm and ankle SBP readings. Mean age was 58 years (SD: 13, range: 18–99), 45% were female and baseline mean BP was 138/80 (SD: 20/12) mm Hg; participant characteristics are summarised in table 1.Table 1Characteristics of participants from 14 studies included in the Arm Based on LEg blood pressure cohortNMean (SD)Age (years)33 71058.4 (13.3)Higher arm systolic blood pressure (mm Hg)33 694137.7 (20.3)Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)25 16779.7 (12.1)Lower leg SBP33 710151.6 (23.4)Body mass index (kg/m2)33 60326.9 (5.2)Total cholesterol (mmol/L)33 3165.3 (1.2)HDL cholesterol (mmol/L)31 3951.3 (0.4)\nN\n\nn (%)\nFemale33 71015 062 (44.7)Current smoker33 7106785 (20.1)Hypertension33 71020 191 (59.9)Diabetes mellitus33 7104917 (14.6)Cardiovascular disease33 7105797 (17.2)Ischaemic heart disease32 3915474 (16.9)Cerebrovascular disease33 6631900 (5.6)Ethnicity33 710 White24 690 (77.5) African American2880 (9.0) Hispanic American1918 (6.0) Black African679 (2.2) Other1680 (5.3)HDL, high-density lipoprotein; SBP, systolic blood pressure.Ankle-arm SBP differenceUsing complete case data (n=30 182), two-stage random effects modelling found the mean ankle-arm SBP difference was 12.0 (95% CI 8.8 to 15.2) mm Hg. Heterogeneity was significant (I2=99.5%, tau2=16.7, p<0.001; figure 1) and did not reduce substantially after adjustment for covariates (I2=97.9%, tau2=0.01, p<0.001).Figure 1Forest plot of ankle-arm systolic blood pressure (SBP) difference using higher-reading arm SBP.Higher-reading arm SBP, female sex, smoking, total cholesterol, ischaemic heart disease and being of African American descent (vs ‘white’ reference) were associated with smaller ankle-arm SBP differences (p<0.05; table 2).

Due to the high level of missing data for HDL cholesterol, this predictor was excluded from models using observed data only. The model using higher-reading ankle SBP demonstrated better model fit than that using lower-reading ankle SBP (AICs: 163 292 vs 163 962, respectively). BMI was not a significant predictor of arm SBP but was retained in the final model for face validity (table 3). Mean (SD) observed arm SBP in the derivation dataset was 137 (20) mm Hg; mean estimated arm SBP in the derivation dataset was 138 (16) mm Hg (calibration slope 1.00 (95% CI 0.99 to 1.01), calibration in the large (intercept) 0.00 (−2.85 to 2.85)). Mean (SD) observed arm SBP in the validation dataset was 137 (21) mm Hg (calibration slope 0.96 (95% CI 0.94 to 0.97), calibration in the large 1.05 (−1.9 to 4.0)).

In sensitivity analyses, models including observed and imputed data were similar to those using observed data only. Therefore, models using observed data only were retained to assess the performance of the estimation model. We quantified the performance of the ankle-arm estimation model using AUROC curves across a range of BPs (figure 2).

These compared unfavourably with an AUROC of 0.868 (95% CI 0.864 to 0.872) for the estimation model for the diagnostic threshold of 140 mm Hg. Respective figures for the 160 mm Hg threshold were 0.855 (95% CI 0.849 to 0.861) compared with 0.880 (95% CI 0.874 to 0.885) (p<0.0001 for both thresholds). At both thresholds, this represented 2% fewer participants being misclassified according to their observed arm SBP by the model in comparison to the previous arithmetic models (online supplemental table S6).Time to event analysisAll-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortalityFor participants without pre-existing CVD, neither lower- nor higher-reading ankle SBP were associated, after adjustment for other predictors, with either all-cause mortality (adjusted HRs 1.00 (95% CI 1.00 to 1.00; p=0.682) and 1.00 (1.00 to 1.00; p=0.796), respectively) or cardiovascular mortality (HRs 1.00 (1.00 to 1.01; p=0.840) and 1.00 (1.00 to 1.01; p=0.297), respectively). Global tests for non-proportional hazards in all-cause mortality analyses indicated some evidence for non-proportional hazards (p=0.019 for lower ankle SBP overall model, p=0.004 for higher ankle SBP model), driven largely by total cholesterol and ethnic group; there was weak evidence of non-proportional hazards for lower and higher ankle SBP (p=0.058 and p=0.074, respectively). Little evidence was found to refute the proportional hazards hypothesis for cardiovascular mortality analyses (lower and higher ankle SBP p=0.216 and p=0.235, respectively). Following sensitivity analysis, including imputation of missing baseline data, lower-reading ankle SBP was predictive of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality (HRs 1.003 (1.001 to 1.005; p=0.005) and 1.007 (1.003 to 1.011; p=0.001), respectively).Fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular eventsIn a dataset comprising 19 350 observations across 11 studies, lower-reading ankle SBP was significantly associated with fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events (HR 1.005 (1.002 to 1.007; p<0.001)). Analyses using multiple imputation of missing data gave similar results (HR 1.006 (1.004 to 1.008; p<0.001)). There was strong evidence for non-proportional hazards (global p=0.010), driven by BMI, total cholesterol and hypertension status, with little evidence for non-proportional hazards with lower ankle SBP (p=0.756).Arm BP estimated from ankle BP in existing cardiovascular risk modelsCalculated Framingham and ASCVD 10-year risk scores were similar using either observed higher-reading arm SBP or estimated arm SBP in both the derivation cohort (ASCVD: 16.7% (12.7) vs 17.2% (12.6); Framingham: 19.3% (15.1) vs 19.9% (15.1)) and validation cohort (ASCVD: 16.4% (12.6) vs 16.9% (12.7); Framingham: 19.6% (14.4) vs 20.8% (14.3)).DiscussionPrincipal findingsTo our knowledge, this is the first IPD meta-analysis to explore the association between arm and ankle SBP and to offer an individualised estimate of arm SBP based on ankle SBP measurements.Using one set of supine sequential SBP measurements from ankles and arms, such as are obtained during ABI measurement protocols, we found that ankle SBP was, on average, 12.0 mm Hg (95% CI 8.8 to 15.2) higher than arm SBP. We developed and validated a model to estimate arm BP from ankle BP which demonstrated greater accuracy than current arithmetic methods of conversion. Established 10-year cardiovascular risk scores calculated using model-derived arm SBP appeared equally accurate to those based on directly measured arm SBP, suggesting it could be used to inform cardiovascular risk estimation and to support individual treatment decisions in people unable to have arm BP measured.Comparison with other studiesPrevious estimates of ankle-arm SBP differences have ranged up to 40 mm Hg.44 Our study-level review reported a pooled ankle-arm SBP difference of 17 mm Hg (95% CI 15.4 to 21.3).14 That finding underpinned current recommendations of the British and Irish Hypertension Society that equate an ankle BP of 155/90 mm Hg to NICE guideline 140/90 mm Hg BP threshold for hypertension.2 10 Other previous recommendations for conversion of ankle BP were based on much smaller sets of data derived from people affected by thalidomide.7 The present analysis suggests that the ankle-arm SBP difference may be lower, averaging about 12 mm Hg.The ankle-arm difference was lower for smokers than non-smokers, in keeping with the preclinical atherosclerotic effects of cigarette consumption observed by others.45 46 Sex differences in ABI, with lower values for females than males, frequently persist following multivariable adjustments and may confound the use of a single, non-sex-specific diagnostic threshold for PAD. Such sex differences are reflected in our model, associating female sex with a smaller ankle-arm difference.47 Differences are also observed between ethnicities, including in the absence of arterial disease, and likely reflect physiological variation in arterial stiffness and pulse amplification.20 47Since ABI estimation does not require DBP measurement, no ankle DBP data were available, so no ankle-arm DBP models were explored. Our study-level review found no clinically important difference between arm and ankle DBPs.14The ankle-arm estimation model demonstrated excellent performance, with AUROC curves remaining above 0.90 across all SBP thresholds in the derivation cohort and above 0.88 in the validation cohort. In addition, sensitivity and specificity remained above 80% across the SBP thresholds, increasing up to 90% as SBP increased. To our knowledge, this is the first model generated using IPD methods, to estimate supine arm SBP from ankle SBP. Our method proved superior to existing arithmetic estimation methods (summarised in box 1), achieving a 2% lower misclassification rate at relevant SBP thresholds.7 10 11 Although this seems small, hypertension is common; the NHS Health Check Programme diagnoses 38 000 new cases annually in England alone.48 Therefore, 2% fewer misclassifications represent over 750 potential misdiagnoses per year in England, or tens of thousands globally.In multivariable models using observed data only, ankle SBP did not predict all-cause or cardiovascular mortality over 10 years. However, after imputation of missing data, the lower-reading ankle SBP was predictive of both outcomes. Prediction of fatal or non-fatal cardiovascular events was consistent across models with or without imputation of missing data for both lower- and higher-reading ankle SBPs. Both low and high ankle BPs have previously been associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.20 49 The weaker associations demonstrated here probably reflect our exclusion criteria for both low (indicating PAD) and high (indicating incompressible calcific arteries) ankle SBP values. Overall, cardiovascular risk was predicted equally well using existing cardiovascular risk models with estimated arm SBPs in comparison to observed arm SBPs.While the higher ankle SBP reading performed better than the lower ankle in estimating arm SBP, the lower-reading ankle performed better in prognostic modelling. These findings were consistent with previous studies and existing consensus recommendations to adopt the higher-reading ankle when determining ABI for the diagnosis of PAD but the lower-reading ankle when using ABI for the prognosis of future events.20 49Strengths and limitations of the studyOur recent study-level meta-analysis of 9771 participants was, until now, the largest study examining the association between ankle and arm BP.14 Conclusions that can be drawn from study-level aggregate meta-analyses are limited since data are combined from different studies with differing population characteristics, analytical approaches and reporting. By using IPD data, we examined the associations between ankle and arm SBP in a considerably larger cohort (over 33 000 participants) than has previously been studied, overcoming some study-level meta-analysis limitations.15 50 However, significant residual heterogeneity remained; there were no clear methodological or demographic explanations for individual outlying studies in two-stage analyses, and heterogeneity was not explained using sensitivity analyses, therefore, we exercise some caution in generalising our findings.These analyses followed an a priori published protocol.16 Unlike study-level reviews, the IPD meta-analysis process requires substantial additional time and resources for data cleaning, preparation and analysis, making it less appropriate for reporting state-of-the-art findings, but well suited for more thorough and appropriate modelling and analyses than our previous review.51 The INTERPRESS-IPD Collaboration, from which the ABLE-BP dataset has been derived, was established in 2017. The INTERPRESS-IPD search strategy sought cohorts with records of BP from both arms, not all four limbs.18 Therefore, recent studies holding potentially eligible data for the current ankle-arm analyses may not have been invited to contribute. However, our inclusion of relevant data for over 33 000 participants in the ABLE-BP dataset has permitted us to model, for the first time, the individual relationships of arm and ankle BPs and to draw robust conclusions from the primary and subgroup analyses.Our participants were mainly from European and North American cohorts, with one Sub-Saharan Africa cohort. Consequently, further validation of our models for people with ethnicities not currently represented is required. Finally, we necessarily excluded participants with diagnosed or suspected PAD from our analyses. PAD may significantly and unpredictably alter the relationship between ankle and arm SBP, making it inappropriate to apply our models to people with known or suspected PAD. Some participants with sub-clinical PAD, not meeting ABI diagnostic criteria for PAD, will undoubtedly have been represented in the cohorts studied, as would be expected for any sample representative of a wider community. Ankle pressures were predominantly measured using Doppler techniques; other approaches, for example oscillometric ankle pressure measurement, can yield different results, so we do not assume equivalence of our models for different techniques of ankle measurement.52 Similarly, any application of our models assumes that ankle measurements were made in the supine position.53Traumatic limb amputation has been associated with subsequent systolic hypertension and increased cardiovascular risk54 55; the causes underlying such associations are unclear.56 Hypertension and cardiovascular events also appear more common among thalidomide survivors than their matched counterparts.57 Our dataset did not include anyone with limb loss; validation of our models in specialised populations with the most to gain from this work, that is, those with limb deformity or loss, would be desirable but challenging to achieve.7 We extracted data from community population studies; intercurrent illnesses could not be accounted for, so our findings cannot be applied to acute care or other non-routine settings or populations.Implications and conclusionsWe conservatively estimate that 6000–10 000 adults may be living with significant congenital or acquired upper limb loss in the UK. Hypertension and CVD are important concerns for people for whom arm BP measurement is not feasible. Current methods for interpreting non-arm BP readings are conflicting, increasing the risk of health inequalities in these individuals. These individuals require accurate interpretation of BP to inform and mitigate their cardiovascular risk and minimise consequences such as stroke.In addition, there are 1.3 million stroke survivors living in the UK; 75% of whom have upper limb dysfunction impairing activities of daily living.58 Self-monitoring and self-titration of BP-lowering treatment achieve lower BPs in people at risk of new or recurrent stroke.59 However, arm measurement is difficult or impossible for many stroke survivors who may also, therefore, benefit from ankle BP measurements.We developed and validated a model that estimates individual arm SBP from ankle SBP measurements using readily available participant characteristics. The higher-reading ankle SBP was a moderately better predictor of higher-reading arm SBP than the lower-reading ankle pressure. To facilitate the use of ankle SBP to estimate arm SBP in individual consultations in patients where arm assessment is not possible or advised, we have developed a freely available, easy-to-use, web-based calculator based on the final model (https://ablebp.research.exeter.ac.uk/).Supplementary material10.1136/bmjopen-2024-094389online supplemental file 1"}

IntroductionAtrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common supraventricular arrhythmia, affecting more than 59 million people globally as of 2019, with its prevalence expected to rise further due to population aging [1]. AF is associated with impaired prognosis. Beyond embolic stroke, it significantly impairs quality of life [2] and raises the likelihood of developing heart failure or the worsening of pre-existing heart failure [3,4]. Moreover, a growing body of evidence suggests that AF may be associated with increased all-cause mortality [5].Continuous heart rhythm monitoring through implantable devices has demonstrated a strong, likely dose-dependent association between AF burden—defined as the percentage of time spent in AF—and these adverse outcomes [6]. Consequently, AF burden has not only provided valuable prognostic insights but has also emerged as a potential therapeutic target [7].However, much of the available evidence comes from patients with implantable defibrillators or pacemakers, populations typically characterized by higher comorbidity. Extrapolating these findings to patients with fewer comorbidities may be problematic and misleading. To bridge this gap, alternative methods for reliable AF monitoring are needed to better understand its prognostic and therapeutic implications in a broader, less comorbid AF population.Wearable devices offer an affordable and user-friendly solution, promoting continuous advancements in health data monitoring and tracking [8]. In a recent review article, Tedschi et al. summarized key insights into the evolving role of telemedicine in improving heart failure management. Within this framework, they highlighted promising evidence supporting the role of wearables in these patients [9]. Among their various applications, wearables have demonstrated diagnostic accuracy in correctly identifying AF episodes, mainly through photoplethysmography [10]. More recently, encouraging findings have emerged regarding their performance in quantifying AF burden [11], raising hopes for the integration of wearables into the tele-monitoring of patients with AF, which could potentially improve their long-term management.In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aim to synthesize and analyze the existing literature data, comparing AF burden quantification using wearable devices with reference ECG monitoring methods. We hope our findings will enhance the understanding of the role of wearables in clinical practice and pave the way for their integration into future research protocols.2. MethodsThis systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines [12]. The predefined protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database (616546).2.1. Search StrategyA systematic literature search was performed up to October 2024 in two databases: Medline (via PubMed) and Scopus. The following keyword-based strategy was used: ((wearable) OR (smartwatch) OR (wristband) OR (photoplethysmography)) AND (atrial fibrillation) AND (burden). Additionally, reference lists of included manuscripts were reviewed for potentially relevant articles (snowball strategy). No date restrictions were applied. Only articles available in English were included.2.2. Study SelectionAll articles identified in the initial search were screened by two independent reviewers (D.K. and C.K.) at the title and abstract levels. Studies deemed potentially eligible were then reviewed in full text to determine inclusion in the final analysis. Disagreements were resolved through consensus with an expert (G.G.). Studies eligible for final analysis included prospective or retrospective studies of adult patients—either with or without a history of AF—that compared the correlation of AF burden estimation between wearables and a reference ECG monitoring method. Both free-living and hospitalized patients were included, while no restriction was applied in terms of the technology/algorithms used in wearables’ software. The minimum study duration for inclusion was 24 h.2.3. Data ExtractionData of interest were extracted into a predesigned Microsoft Office Excel 2007 form by two independent reviewers (D.K. and C.K.) and then crosschecked for any disagreements. Disagreements were resolved by consensus with a senior (G.G.). In cases of inadequate data reporting (in otherwise eligible studies), corresponding authors were contacted electronically (via email).2.4. Risk of BiasThe JBI critical appraisal checklist for diagnostic test accuracy studies [13] was used (in duplicate) to assess the risk of bias regarding the outcome of interest. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. Studies with an overall score ≥ 70% were considered of high quality, whereas those scoring < 50% were rated as low quality. Publication bias was evaluated using a Bayesian regression model based on the regression of the effect sizes against their standard errors, similarly to the classic Egger’s test [14].2.5. Statistical AnalysisContinuous variables were summarized as the mean (standard deviation). When continuous data were reported as the median with an interquartile range, the median was assumed as the mean and the standard deviation was estimated by dividing the interquartile range by 1.35. AF burden was defined as the percentage of time spent in AF relative to the total monitoring time. To estimate the true difference between methods, we used the mean error along with its standard error as the outcome of interest. In cases where this outcome was not directly available in the text, Bland–Altman plots were used for visual estimation.Given the limited number of eligible studies and the methodological differences—such as the use of different software across studies—a high degree of heterogeneity was expected. Since even small differences in AF burden may have clinical significance, it is crucial to estimate the probability that the true effect size lies within a specific range. Bayesian models are better suited for this task because they provide credible intervals, which directly reflect the probability distribution of the true effect size. In contrast, frequentist models are less reliable when dealing with small datasets and high heterogeneity, as they tend to underestimate uncertainty and produce artificially narrow confidence intervals, increasing the risk of overconfident conclusions. To address these issues, we adopted a Bayesian approach, which allows us to derive a posterior distribution and probabilistically estimate the true effect size. Given the anticipated degree of heterogeneity between studies, we adopted a hierarchical Bayesian random effects model [15]. This model accounts for the complexity of the available data, providing a more accurate estimate of the true effect size. We chose weakly informative priors. For the intercept, we assumed a normal distribution with a mean around zero, leaving enough uncertainty by setting the standard deviation to 0.45 (normal (0, 0.45)). To account for the expected between-study heterogeneity, we selected a heavy-tailed half-Cauchy distribution with a scale of 1 (half-Cauchy (0,1)). The Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm (with a target Rhat value < 1.1) was employed to obtain the posterior distribution and the 95% credible intervals (CrIs) [16]. Finally, we calculated the Bayes factor to evaluate the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the methods in quantifying AF burden. Values > 3 strongly support the alternative hypothesis, and values < 1/3 strongly support the null hypothesis, while values between 1/3 and 3 do not allow for robust conclusions [17]. Additionally, sub-analysis was performed to investigate the effect size in studies using only smartwatches, while meta-regression analyses were conducted to investigate the influence of other confounders (mean age, sex, hours of monitoring). All analyses were performed using R Foundation software (version 4.1.2) with the brms package.3. ResultsThe initial search identified 112 articles, of which 7 were eligible for the final analysis. One was excluded due to duplication, thus leaving six studies in the final analysis [18,19,20,21,22,23]. The flow of study selection is depicted in Figure 1. The included studies involved 778 patients (54% males) with a mean (SD) age of 66 [12] years, of whom 90% had a history of AF (81.5% paroxysmal). Five studies assessed smartwatches using photoplethysmography, while one study evaluated a wearable heart belt. As a reference method, four studies used an ECG patch and two studies used a Holter monitor. Most recordings were conducted in free-living settings. The proportion of non-interpretable recordings ranged from 0% to 50.7%. In total, 125,482 h of interpretable simultaneous recordings were analyzed across the parent studies to evaluate the diagnostic performance of wearable devices in AF detection. Almost 36,978 h of valid simultaneous recordings—from 448 patients—were analyzed to estimate the performance of wearable devices in quantifying AF burden. To calculate the mean error, all but one study focused exclusively on patients with documented AF episodes during the study period. The characteristics of the included studies are summarized in Table 1.3.1. Quality AssessmentThrough the use of the JBI critical appraisal checklist for diagnostic test accuracy studies, all studies were assessed as being of high quality (Table 2). In the regression analysis of the effect sizes against their standard errors, no significant publication bias was observed (Egger’s test modified: 0.27 (95%CrI: −0.87 to 1.54)).3.2. Meta-Analysis ResultsA Bayesian model using 10 chains with 100,000 iterations (the first 10,000 as a warm-up) achieved the desired convergence. The corresponding trace plots showed minor fluctuation around the mean, indicating credible meta-analysis results (Figure 2). The Bayesian meta-analysis documented no statistically significant differences between the two methods (mean error: 0.1; 95%CrIs: −0.04 to 0.07; Rhat: 1.01). The posterior probability distribution is displayed in Figure 3. Although between-study heterogeneity was limited, it was not negligible (sd: 0.06; 95%CrIs: 0.03 to 0.13; Rhat: 1.01). The Bayes factor was calculated to be 0.058, providing strong support for the null hypothesis.Meta-regression analyses revealed no significant confounding effects from mean age, sex distribution, or monitoring duration.A sub-analysis including the five studies that exclusively assessed smartwatches was also performed (375 patients, 37,754 h of simultaneous recordings). The trace plots again confirmed credible convergence (Figure 4). According to the Bayesian meta-analysis, no statistically significant difference was identified (mean error: 0.01; 95%CrIs: −0.07 to 0.10; Rhat: 1). The posterior probability distribution is illustrated in Figure 5. Limited between-study heterogeneity was observed (sd: 0.08; 95%CrIs: 0.03 to 0.21; Rhat: 1.01). The Bayes factor was 0.076, which strongly supports the null hypothesis.4. DiscussionIn this systematic review and meta-analysis, we evaluated the ability of wearable devices to quantify AF burden by analyzing data from studies that directly compared wearables to reference ECG monitoring methods. All included studies were prospective and of high methodological quality, while no publication bias was identified. Most of them focused on smartwatches utilizing photoplethysmography technology. Given the limited number of studies and patients, we adopted a Bayesian approach to allow for a probabilistic estimation of the true effect size. The findings of our analysis strongly support the null hypothesis, indicating no statistically significant difference between wearables and reference ECG methods. The mean error was estimated to be +1%, with a 95% CrI ranging from −4% to 7%. No confounding effects related to mean age, sex, or monitoring duration were identified. In a sub-analysis, limited to smartwatch studies, the mean error fell within a slightly broader scale (from −7% to 10%). However, it is important to note that these findings are applicable only to valid recordings obtained during simultaneous monitoring. Given the high proportion of non-interpretable recordings in most studies and the potential for gaps when devices are not worn, caution is warranted when interpreting periods without monitoring.Previous research has established the high diagnostic accuracy of wearable devices for AF detection, with no significant difference between single-lead ECG and photoplethysmography-based devices [24,25]. However, to our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis to focus on the quantification of AF burden, providing promising results that could be relevant for both clinical practice and future research.Clinical AF diagnosis requires the recording of a 12-lead ECG demonstrating an irregular rhythm without visible P waves. AF is further classified as paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent depending on the duration of the arrhythmia and whether efforts to restore normal sinus rhythm have been abandoned [26]. This classification holds clinical significance, as previous studies indicate that the progression from paroxysmal to persistent form is associated with worse outcomes [27]. However, treating AF solely as a categorical variable may be misleading. Emerging evidence suggests that AF burden—the percentage of time a patient is in AF—provides additional prognostic value. Findings from the SOS AF Project indicate that for patients with cardiac implantable devices, each additional hour of AF burden corresponds to a 3% increase in the risk of stroke [28]. Similarly, Steinberg et al. reported that every 10% increase in AF burden was associated with a 9% higher risk of new-onset heart failure and a 5% increase in all-cause mortality [29]. Notably, the CIRCA-DOSE study demonstrated that even AF burdens exceeding 0.1% were associated with increased healthcare utilization [30].The clinical value of AF burden is further supported by recent studies demonstrating that its reduction is associated with prognostic benefits. In a sub-analysis of the CASTLE-AF Trial, Brachmann et al. reported that reducing AF burden below 50% significantly decreased the incidence of hard clinical outcomes [31]. These benefits also extend to quality-of-life improvements [32,33]. Thus, beyond its general prognostic significance, AF burden has emerged as a potential therapeutic target, particularly following rhythm control interventions [34].Most available evidence on AF burden quantification comes from studies using implantable devices, making extrapolation to a healthier population potentially misleading. Insertable cardiac monitors have demonstrated high accuracy in both detecting AF episodes and quantifying AF burden [35], rendering them the most precise option for AF monitoring. However, the implantation process as well as the high cost and the limited longevity currently restricts their widespread use, reserving them primarily for patients where an accurate and timely diagnosis is mandatory [36,37]. This underscores an unmet need for low-cost, user-friendly, and accurate alternatives for AF monitoring.Technological advancements have led to the increased adoption of wearable devices, which are now commonly used to promote a healthy lifestyle and manage existing conditions [38]. In cardiology, wearables have been used to monitor parameters such as heart rhythm using ECG and photoplethysmography, a technology that detects blood volume changes in the microvascular bed [39]. Recent studies have demonstrated the accuracy of these devices in correctly identifying AF episodes [25]. Given that wearables are typically worn throughout the day, there is a growing interest in their potential to reliably monitor and quantify AF burden.In this systematic review, we gathered the existing literature data to evaluate the ability of wearables to quantify AF burden. Our analysis strongly supports the conclusion that there is no statistically significant difference between wearables and reference ECG methods in quantifying AF burden. Wearables tended to overestimate AF burden by 1%; however, the true difference likely lies between −5% and 7%, with 95% probabilities. This difference may be slightly higher for smartwatches using photoplethysmography. These findings are promising, supporting further evaluation of wearables in research protocols to better establish their reliability. They also pave the way for their use in clinical practice. Wearables could serve two primary purposes: first, for prognostic purposes, to identify patients at higher risk of adverse outcomes who may benefit from more aggressive rhythm control strategies; and second, to optimize therapeutic strategies, using AF burden reduction as a treatment target. However, these findings should be interpreted with caution. The clinical significance of different AF burden levels and the optimal rate of reduction remain uncertain. Consequently, we cannot yet determine whether differences, such as those of the observed magnitude, are truly clinically insignificant. Moreover, the high percentage of invalid recordings, coupled with periods when devices are not worn, may create substantial gaps in AF monitoring.This meta-analysis also has several limitations. Most studies used different devices and algorithms to quantify AF burden, which may be a potential source of heterogeneity. Wearable device recordings also had a high percentage of non-interpretable data, potentially concealing valuable information. These recording limitations could arise from device-related factors (e.g., sensor quality, algorithm performance) or patient-related factors (e.g., movement artifacts, skin characteristics). Additionally, the available data did not allow us to assess potential confounders such as body mass index and skin color, preventing the identification of patient phenotypes that may be prone to outlier measurements. Finally, the current data do not allow us to definitively conclude whether this lack of statistical significance reflects a true absence of clinically meaningful differences.5. ConclusionsIn conclusion, this systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the performance of wearable devices in quantifying AF burden. We included studies comparing wearables to reference ECG monitoring methods, focusing on the mean error in burden estimation. Most studies assessed smartwatches utilizing photoplethysmography to quantify AF burden in free-living settings. Bayesian analysis indicated no statistically significant difference between the methods, with the true difference estimated to range between −4% and +7%. These results are encouraging, supporting the integration of wearables into clinical practice, particularly for prognostic and research purposes. However, they simultaneously highlight that further research is necessary to confirm the reliability of wearables for therapeutic monitoring and treatment response assessment. Future efforts should also focus on optimizing algorithms to reduce non-interpretable data and improve the accuracy of these devices.6. Clinical PerspectivesWearable devices, at least theoretically, could be used in a free-living setting to provide useful information regarding AF burden;According to the meta-analysis of the existing literature, no statistically significant difference was observed between wearables and reference ECG monitoring methods, with the mean error estimated at 1% and the 95% CrIS ranging from −4 to 7%;This range may be slightly larger for smartwatches;These findings support the potential role of wearables in future research and clinical practice. However, the relationship between different levels of burden and outcomes is not yet clear. Therefore, further research is needed to determine whether differences, such as those of the observed magnitude, are clinically significant or not."}

Introduction:During recent years, developments in cardiopulmonary resuscitation, education regarding the use of automated external defibrillators, and treatment of post-cardiac arrest syndrome have improved the survival of patients following cardiac arrest. However, many cases show poor post-cardiac arrest outcomes, including severe sequelae, disability, being bedridden, and brain death (1). Targeted temperature management (TTM) and post-cardiac arrest management are used as neuroprotective care. Estimation of the neurologic prognosis of patients with cardiac arrest is required to use appropriate interventions and allocate resources according to the predicted severity of outcomes (2, 3). Previous studies have investigated different methods as estimators of neurological outcomes after cardiac arrest, including blood biomarkers, imaging, electroencephalography, and physical examinations (4-7). However, there is no definite prognostic method for estimating neurological outcomes, and the results of the majority of these methods are conflicting, need to be repeated to provide consistent findings, and are predictive only after 72 hours of cardiac arrest (8). Increased intracranial pressure and brain edema can be estimated by the optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD), which also predicts neurological outcomes. While most studies on the prognostic application of ONSD for neurological outcomes have been conducted in brain trauma patients, investigations on the predictive performance of ONSD after cardiac arrest are limited (9, 10). Recent studies have investigated the predictive role of ONSD measurement using computed tomography (CT) or ultrasound for predicting neurological outcomes after cardiac arrest, but their findings have been inconsistent. Therefore, there is still great uncertainty about the usage of ONSD measurement as an indirect method for the prediction of neurological outcomes following cardiac arrest. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to investigate the predictive value of ONSD measurement for neurological outcomes in cardiac arrest survivors. 2. Methods:2.1 Literature SearchWe performed this meta-analysis according to the Preferred Reporting Items for a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies (PRISMA-DTA). We comprehensively performed a systematic search in three main electronic databases including Scopus, Medline, and Web of Science Cochrane spanning the period from inception to August 2024. We incorporated the following keywords and MeSH terms “resuscitation” OR “arrest” OR “cardiopulmonary resuscitation” OR \"heart arrest\" OR “cardiac arrest” OR “cardiac life support” AND “optic nerve sheath diameter” in our search. Systematic search was carried out by two independent authors and disagreements were resolved by the third author.2.2 Study SelectionOur systematic review focused on cardiac arrest survivors who were evaluated using ONSD measurement by ultrasound or CT scan to predict neurological outcomes. Studies reporting the sensitivity and specificity of ONSD for predicting neurological outcomes were included. Studies that did not report these diagnostic parameters or where sensitivity and specificity could not be calculated based on the provided data were excluded. Letters to editors, editorials, commentary, expert opinions, reviews, conference abstracts, case reports, and case series with fewer than 10 cases were excluded from our study.2.3 Data ExtractionThe data of the following variables were collected from included studies: first author, year of publication, country, design of the study, methods of ONSD measurement, sample size, cut-off for ONSD, sensitivity, and specificity. Data extraction was conducted by two independent authors and inconsistencies were resolved by the third author.2.4 Quality AssessmentSeven domains of the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool were evaluated for each study to assess the risk of bias. The results for each item were categorized as unclear, low, or high risk.2.5 Statistical AnalysisPooled results of diagnostic parameters were estimated using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) version 3. Heterogeneity between studies regarding the results of each diagnostic parameter was assessed using the I² statistic and the Q test. Based on the heterogeneity evaluation results, fixed or random effects models were used to estimate the pooled diagnostic parameters. Meta-regressions were performed for subgroup analysis. Publication bias was assessed using Begg’s test and funnel plot analysis.3. Results3.1 Study SelectionA total of 305 eligible published studies were identified through our systematic search of electronic databases. After removing duplicates, 261 articles remained for the title and abstract review stage. After the title and abstract review, 50 studies were selected for full-text review. Two studies that did not report the exact values of sensitivity and specificity were excluded from our analysis (4, 11). Finally, 14 studies were included in our meta-analysis. The PRISMA flowchart depicting the process of study selection is shown in Figure 1.3.2 Characteristics of the Included StudiesIn our meta-analysis, 14 published articles involving 871 patients were included to estimate the predictive value of ONSD for neurological outcomes. Ten studies were conducted in South Korea, two in Germany, one in France, and one in Japan. The included studies were published between 2013 to 2024. Ten studies were retrospective and the remaining four studies were prospective. Other characteristics of the included studies are summarized in Table 1.3.3 Quality Assessment and Publication BiasQuality assessment of the 14 included studies using QUADAS-2 showed that the majority of the studies had a low risk of bias. Some studies did not report the details of their patient selection, which was categorized as unclear for this item. Egger’s test for sensitivity showed no significant bias (P = 0.45), while the test for specificity was statistically significant (P = 0.001). The funnel plot used to evaluate publication bias showed similar findings (Figures 2 and 3).3.4 Meta-analysis and Meta-regressionThe pooled sensitivity and specificity for predicting neurological outcomes using ONSD measurement were 0.56 (95% CI, 0.35–0.74) and 0.92 (95% CI, 0.85–0.96), respectively (Figures 4 and 5). The results of the I² and Cochrane Q statistic tests showed significant heterogeneity between the included studies with respect to sensitivity (I² = 95% and P < 0.01) and specificity (I² = 77% and P < 0.01). Meta-regression revealed that as the cutoff level of ONSD increases, the sensitivity significantly decreases (P < 0.01), while the specificity significantly increases (P = 0.01) (Figures 6 and 7). Furthermore, meta-regression analysis revealed that ONSD measurement using CT scans is significantly associated with lower sensitivity and higher specificity compared to ultrasound (P = 0.009 and P = 0.01, respectively).4. Discussion:This meta-analysis aimed to investigate the predictive value of ONSD measurement for neurological outcomes after cardiac arrest. It showed low sensitivity (0.56) and high specificity (0.92). We also found that using a higher cut-off for ONSD is associated with lower sensitivity and higher specificity. Interestingly, assessment of ONSD using CT scans instead of ultrasound is correlated with lower sensitivity and higher specificity. The majority of our included studies had a low risk of bias. Publication bias was found for specificity, while this was not significant for sensitivity.In a similar study, Lee et al. (12) performed a meta-analysis using a systematic search in PubMed and Embase from inception to 2018 to identify articles investigating ONSD for predicting neurological outcomes in survivors of cardiac arrest. They used a simple search query, which yielded eight studies involving 766 patients. They found that ONSD had a sensitivity of 0.41 and a specificity of 0.99 for predicting neurological outcomes. Their reported sensitivity was lower than what we found, while their specificity was higher than ours. After publishing their meta-analysis, a letter to the editor was published regarding this meta-analysis (13). The letter stated that the meta-analysis by Lee et al. included a study incorrectly. In the incorrectly included study, predictive parameters, and cut-off values were not reported, so this study could not be used for the meta-analysis. This study accounted for 43% of the assessed cases in the meta-analysis by Lee et al., which could considerably affect the pooled estimations. We did not include this study in our meta-analysis, which may partly explain the differences in the values of sensitivity and specificity between our study and those reported by Lee et al. Another explanation for the difference between our findings and those reported by Lee et al. is that they performed a systematic search with a lower number of keywords in PubMed and Embase, which yielded eight studies. In contrast, we used a comprehensive search query in Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science, which identified 14 eligible studies. Moreover, it should be noted that they used a Bayesian method to construct 2×2 tables. In contrast, since the majority of our included studies did not report sufficient data to construct 2×2 tables, we pooled the sensitivities and specificities directly.Another systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted by Zhang et al. (14) on the predictive performance of ONSD for neurological outcomes after cardiac arrest. They performed a systematic search in electronic databases, including Web of Science, Cochrane, PubMed, and ScienceDirect, from their inception to 2020. Similar to the meta-analysis by Lee et al., they included eight studies but did not include the study that was incorrectly included in that meta-analysis. However, the number of patients included in the meta-analysis by Zhang et al. was 473, which was considerably lower than in our study and the study by Lee et al. They reported a sensitivity of 0.6 and a specificity of 0.94 for ONSD. Their sensitivity and specificity were slightly higher than those we calculated in our study. These differences can be explained by the variations in the number of studies and patients included in the meta-analyses. Their subgroup analysis indicated that the cut-off of ONSD and the method of ONSD measurement do not affect the predictive performance of ONSD for neurological outcomes, which is inconsistent with our subgroup analysis.In a meta-analysis by Kim et al. (15), a systematic search was conducted in Medline, Cochrane, and Embase to find studies that investigated the predictive performance of ONSD. They included nine studies in their systematic review, but for the estimation of the sensitivity and specificity of ONSD, they only included five studies. They reported a sensitivity of 0.36 and a specificity of 0.98 for predicting neurological outcomes using ONSD measurement. Similar to the meta-analysis by Lee et al., they included a study that was indicated as incorrect in a letter to the editor in this meta-analysis.Table 1The characteristics of the included studies\nAuthors\n\nYear\n\nCountry\n\nDesign\n\nMethod\n\nSample Size\n\nCutoff\n\nSensitivity\n\nSpecificity\nUeda et al.

LimitationsOur study had three main limitations. First, the included studies used different methods of ONSD measurement, study designs, and cut-off values for ONSD, which resulted in significant heterogeneity in the results and made extrapolation of our findings complicated. Second, the majority of the included studies had a small number of cases. Third, most studies did not report exact data for true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, or data that could be used to calculate these values, leading to limitations in estimating other diagnostic parameters.6. Conclusion:Our meta-analysis showed that ONSD has low sensitivity and high specificity for predicting neurological outcomes in survivors of cardiac arrest. However, since the cut-off values and methods of ONSD measurement affect its predictive performance, further studies will be required to standardize these factors to achieve optimal predictive parameters."}

Long-standing diabetes mellitus leads to various complications, including microvascular and macrovascular complications [2]. A meta-analysis of 102 prospective studies showed that patients with DM are at a two-fold risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, and death compared to other risk factors [2]. Tight glycemic control has been shown to reduce microvascular complications, but controversial results have been seen for macrovascular complications [3], [4]. However, various studies indicate that some hypoglycemic medications, despite being effective in lowering blood glucose, may increase the risk of cardiovascular events [5], [6]. Due to these findings, since 2008, cardiovascular outcomes data has been required from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for granting new anti-diabetic medications, including Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogs [7], [8].GLP-1 analogs are glucose-lowering medications for managing various metabolic diseases, including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), overweight, and obesity [9]. They act on GLP-1 receptors in multiple organ systems, including the central nervous system, heart, kidneys, and pancreas, and food is the strongest stimulus for their secretion [10]. Various GLP-1 analog medications have been approved so far for managing metabolic diseases. With RCTs requiring cardiovascular outcome data for granting new diabetic medications, GLP-1 analogs were shown to have reduced major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in T2DM patients [11], [12].However, their efficacy in reducing cerebrovascular events has not been well-established in diabetic and non diabetic patients, with controversial results [13], [14], [15]. Due to this, we have conducted a meta-analysis on stroke outcomes by pooling data from RCTs to evaluate the efficacy of GLP-1 RAs on stroke risk in patients with and without diabetes.2MethodsThis meta-analysis was conducted and reported following the PRISMA (Preferred reporting items for systematic review and Meta-analysis) 2020 guidelines [16] and performed according to established methods, as described previously [17], [18], [19].2.1Search strategyWe conducted a systematic literature search in PubMed, Embase, and ClinicalTrial.gov using predefined MESH terms by using “AND” and “OR”. The following search terms were used: (((((((((((((((((((diabetes mellitus[MeSH Terms]) OR (type 2 diabetes mellitus[MeSH Terms])) AND (glucagon like peptide1[MeSH Terms])) OR (glucagon-like-peptide-1 receptor agonist[Other Term])) OR (semaglutide[Other Term])) OR (liraglutide[Other Term])) OR (albiglutide[Other Term])) OR (exenatide[Other Term])) OR (tirzepatide[Other Term])) AND (type 2 diabetes mellitus[MeSH Terms]))) AND (obesity [MeSH Terms]))) AND (acute stroke[MeSH Terms])) OR (stroke[Other Term])) OR (ischemic stroke[MeSH Terms])) OR (hemorrhagic stroke[MeSH Terms])) AND (fatal outcomes[MeSH Terms]). We queried databases from their search inception up until 15th July 2024 without any restrictions on the language of the studies.All the studies were carefully screened and exported to the Mendeley reference manager, which handles searched citations. A manual check was carried out to cross-check for any remaining duplicates. Two reviewers (V.M and F. S. A) reviewed the papers based on the title and abstract. Another author (A.G) arbitrated discrepancies regarding the inclusion of studies.2.2Eligibility criteriaWe included only clinical trials involving patients ≥ 18 years of age with and without diabetes, and obesity. It was decided to include studies with two arms in one, with GLP-1RAs used as an intervention and placebo as a control group. Studies must have reported outcomes of interest (primary and secondary outcomes). Studies performed on animals, reviews, case reports, case series, studies with a single arm or without GLP-1 RA as an intervention, or studies without outcomes of interest were excluded from the review.2.3Clinical outcomesThe primary outcome of this meta-analysis was stroke. Secondary outcomes include fatal stroke, nonfatal stroke, and adverse events such as ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, embolic stroke, and cerebrovascular accident.2.4Data extraction and quality assessmentData from the eligible studies, such as demographic, study design, comorbidity, follow-up, and outcomes between GLP-1 RA and placebo groups, were extracted to a Microsoft Excel® 2019 spreadsheet by two authors (T.K and S.N).Two authors (F.S.A and N.D) independently assessed the quality of the included studies using Cochrane Collaboration’s tool for assessing the risk of bias in randomized controlled trials.x2.5Statistical analysisBaseline continuous variables were summarized in mean (standard deviation), whereas dichotomous variables were described in frequency or percentage. We performed a conventional meta-analysis for primary and secondary outcomes and adopted the DerSimonian and Laird random-effect model for the study variations. Outcomes were reported as pooled odds ratio (OR) and their corresponding 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI). Statistical significance was met if the 95 % CI did not cross the numeric “1″ and the two-tailed p-value was less than 0.05. We considered a two-tailed p-value of less than 0.05 to be statistically significant. In addition, we assessed the between-study heterogeneity using the Higgins I-square (I2) test, with I2 values < 75 % considered mild-moderate and > 75 % considered high [20]. All statistical work, inclusive analysis, and graphical illustrations were conducted using STATA (version 17.0, StataCorp) [21].3ResultsThe preliminary database search using the pre-specified keywords yielded 1387 articles, of which 104 duplicate studies were excluded. 1236 studies were further excluded from the initial post-title and abstract screening based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria and comparison arm. The full-text review was conducted for the remaining 47 articles identified during the search period, of which 36 studies were excluded: no desired outcomes, single arm, conference abstract, studies without any desired outcome. Hence, a total of 11 studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in the meta-analysis [11], [13], [15], [14], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [12], [27]. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram is depicted in Fig. 1.Fig. 1Prisma flow diagram.A total of 11 randomized controlled trials with 85,373 patients were included (43,339 in GLP-1 RA and 42,034 in the placebo group) in the analysis. The mean age of the GLP-1 RAs group was 63.5 years, and 63.1 years in the placebo group. The median follow-up duration was 2.1 years.

On the contrary, while 3 RCTs were classified as having “some concerns” about their methodological quality. (Supplementary Fig. 1A-B).3.2Meta-analysis of primary and secondary outcomesThe pooled analysis of primary and secondary endpoints showed that GLP-1 RAs significantly reduced the risk of stroke by 15 % (OR, 0.85(95 %CI: 0.77–0.93), P < 0.001), I2 = 0) (Fig. 2), nonfatal stroke by 13 % (OR, 0.87(95 %CI: 0.79–0.95), P < 0.01), I2 = 0) when compared with placebo. However, the risk of fatal stroke was comparable between GLP-1 RA and placebo groups (OR, 0.94(95 %CI: 0.75–1.17), P = 0.56), I2 = 0) (Fig. 3A-B).Fig. 2Forest plots of primary outcomes including risk of stroke.Fig. 3Forest plot of secondary outcome including A) Nonfatal Stroke, B) Fatal Stroke.\nMeta-analysis of adverse events\nPooled analysis showed that the risk of hemorrhagic stroke (OR, 0.82(95 %CI: 0.42–1.60), P = 0.57), I2 = 0), ischemic stroke (OR, 0.85(95 %CI: 0.64–1.13), P = 0.26), I2 = 0), and embolic stroke (OR, 2.33(95 %CI: 0.49–11.09), P = 0.29), I2 = 0) was comparable between GLP-1 RA and placebo. However, a nonsignificant reduction in cerebrovascular accidents was observed among the GLP-1 RA group (OR, 0.75(95 %CI: 0.57–1.00), P = 0.05), I2 = 0) (Fig. 4).Fig. 4Forest plot of adverse event outcome of A) Hemorrhagic Stroke, B) Ischemic Stroke, C) Embolic stroke, D) Cerebrovascular accident. Central Illustration: Efficacy of Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists for Prevention of Stroke among Patients with and without Diabetes: A Meta-Analysis with the SELECT and FLOW trails.\nPublication bias\nAssessment of publication bias through funnel plot visualization showed that there was no evidence of publication bias for the primary outcome, and secondary outcomes. (Supplementary Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4).4DiscussionOur comprehensive analysis, incorporating 11 RCTs with 85,373 patients, evaluated the therapeutic efficacy and safety of GLP-1 RA for stroke risk in patients with and without diabetes. When compared with placebo, GLP-1RA demonstrated a 15 % reduction in the risk of stroke. Additionally, the risk of nonfatal stroke was reduced by 13 %, while the risk of fatal stroke was comparable between both cohorts (Central Illustration). The risk of serious adverse events, including hemorrhagic stroke, and ischemic stroke, was also comparable. However, the risk of cerebrovascular accident found to be lower among GLP-1 receptor agonists.The cardioprotective and neuroprotective effects of GLP-1RAs are well-established. These drugs are recognized for their capacity to mitigate TNF-α-induced oxidative stress and inflammation in endothelial cells through mechanisms involving calcium and AMPK [28], [29]. These agents effectively diminish the incidence and progression of early-stage atherosclerotic plaque formation and enhance plaque stability [30]. Moreover, GLP-1RAs are notable for their ability to lower levels of inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 [31]. They also exhibit antioxidant and neuroprotective effects by upregulating vascular endothelial growth factor production and decreasing proinflammatory cytokine production [32], [33]. Additionally, GLP-1RAs can stimulate the expression of several antioxidant genes downstream of protein kinase A (PKA) and cAMP response element-binding (CREB) protein, contributing meaningfully to reducing oxidative stress [34]. Furthermore, attenuation of the toxic effects of glucose by impeding the ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways is also mediated by GLP-1RAs [35]. As such, intracerebroventricular administration of GLP-1RA has been shown to reduce cerebral infarct volume in rats subjected to ischemia–reperfusion injury [32], [36]. Overall, these findings suggest that GLP-1RAs possess anti-atherosclerotic and vasculoprotective properties, labeling it as the sole drug class among the new hypoglycemic agents that significantly lower the risk of stroke [37].Our findings concluded significant benefits for cerebrovascular outcomes, which align with previously available literature. A meta-analysis of 7 CVOTs proposed similar results by showcasing that GLP-1RAs reduced the risk of stroke by 16 %, while the risk of fatal stroke was comparable between both cohorts [38]. Another meta-analysis based on 28 RCTs corroborated our findings and suggested that GLP-1RAs are associated with a 15 % risk reduction for non-fatal stroke [39]. However, it is noteworthy that this meta-analysis pooled only the studies catering to type 2 diabetes mellitus patients, unlike the analysis of this study. Although our analysis consistently demonstrated the neuroprotective effects of GLP-1RAs, it showed that these drugs did not lower the risk for hemorrhagic stroke with statistical significance. This finding is in line with the meta-analysis of Wei et al., which indicated similar results because of the low number of events and low power of their analysis [40]. Interestingly, Wei et al. also demonstrated that GLP-1RAs significantly reduce the risk of ischemic stroke, which contradicts our findings.Our meta-analysis demonstrated several strengths, underscoring the robustness and reliability of our findings. To our best knowledge, this is the very first meta-analysis to include recently published FLOW randomized trial and evaluate the safety and efficacy of GLP-1 RA for risk of stroke and its types. Secondly, the outcomes exhibited low heterogeneity, indicating a high degree of consistency across the included studies. This low variability enhances the credibility of our conclusions, as the results are less likely to be influenced by between-study differences. Thirdly, all outcomes were reported by a substantial number of studies. This extensive reporting enhances the validity of our results by ensuring that the findings are not based on a limited or skewed dataset. Lastly, our analysis encompassed a large sample size, significantly reducing the risk of bias and increasing the statistical power of our findings. The inclusion of a vast number of participants allows for more precise estimates of the effect sizes and improves the generalizability of our results to broader populations.Despite the robustness of our meta-analysis, we acknowledge several limitations of this study. Firstly, the included studies lacked specific data on the recurrence of stroke or mortality following a stroke. This absence of detailed outcome data limited our ability to fully assess the long-term effects and prognosis associated with the GLP-1RAs. Secondly, our meta-analysis failed to incorporate disabling stroke as an outcome because of the absence of specific data on disabling stroke outcomes across the included studies. This restricts the interpretation of GLP-1 RA efficacy in preventing strokes with long-term functional impairments. Thirdly, we did not perform subgroup analyses based on prior history of stroke or important risk factors for stroke, such as age. The failure to stratify the data according to these critical variables obscured potential variations in the effects of GLP-1RAs among different patient populations, thereby limiting the clinical applicability of our findings. Fourthly, some of our outcomes were non-significant, which may reflect either a true lack of effect or insufficient statistical power to detect the differences. This limitation suggests that further research with larger sample sizes may be needed to draw more definitive conclusions. Finally, we failed to take into account the impact of eGFR on the efficacy of GLP-1RA, which might have added value to our existing analysis.5ConclusionThis meta-analysis demonstrates that GLP-1RAs significantly reduce the overall risk of stroke by 15 % and nonfatal stroke by 13 %. The safety profile of GLP-1RAs is favorable, with no significant differences in serious adverse events, including cerebrovascular accident, hemorrhagic stroke, and ischemic stroke. These neuroprotective effects are likely due to reduced oxidative stress, inflammation, and atherosclerotic plaque formation. While the benefits of GLP-1RAs are evident, further research is needed to fully understand their long-term effects and impact on different patient subgroups.Ethical approval: Not required.\nFinancial support\nThis analysis did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.CRediT authorship contribution statementAsmita Gera: Writing – original draft, Investigation, Conceptualization.

The incidence of kidney impairment following cardiovascular surgery varies substantially between studies. For example, one study found that 37% of patients undergoing coronary surgery, 49% undergoing valve surgery, and 55% undergoing aortic surgery experienced this condition.\n6\n The risk increases when cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is used. In some studies, the prevalence of AKI following cardiac surgery with CPB is as high as 35%, with approximately 1.5% of patients requiring dialysis.\n7\nThe pathophysiology of AKI is complex and influenced by several factors. In the perioperative context, one of the most common causes is prolonged hypoperfusion (pre-kidney AKI), which is associated with septic shock, cardiogenic shock, hypovolemia, and haemorrhage. Furthermore, the use of perioperative nephrotoxic medications and contrast medium can further decrease kidney function.\n8\nMeasures to decrease or mitigate the risk of cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury (CSA-AKI) can significantly reduce morbidity and healthcare costs. Various perioperative pharmacological prevention strategies have been proposed. These include treatment with corticosteroids, albumin, erythropoietin, statins, N-acetylcysteine, sodium bicarbonate, intraoperative/postoperative dopamine, anaesthetics (volatile or IV), mannitol, furosemide, or fenoldopam.9–11 Research has been conducted to assess whether amino acids can prevent AKI, but a conclusive answer is still unavailable. One study involving critically ill patients who received either IV amino acids or standard care, found no significant difference in the duration of kidney impairment.\n12\n However, another study in patients undergoing valve surgery and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), found that amino acid supplementation may help reduce the duration of AKI and improve estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\n13\nConsidering the high prevalence and strong association between AKI and poor outcomes, developing strategies for kidney protection is essential, especially for high-risk groups such as patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the evidence regarding the potential of IV amino acids to protect the kidneys of patients undergoing cardiac surgery.MethodsPubMed, Cochrane Library, and EMBASE were systematically searched for relevant studies published from inception to July 25, 2024. Key words/terms in both AND and OR combinations included: kidney; acute kidney injury; amino acids; infusion; intravenous; cardiac surgical procedures; thoracic surgery; cardiothoracic surgery. In addition, the reference lists of all included studies were reviewed for potential additional publications, and we performed forward citation searching via the Web of Science to obtain other relevant studies. The systematic review was conducted according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) regulations.\n14\n Ethical committee approval was not required and the review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024565982).All references retrieved by our search were imported to Endnote v20 and duplicates were removed. Four authors [AH. TA, BK, BN] independently screened the titles and abstracts of all studies and selected relevant studies. Any discrepancy or disagreement was resolved by another author [AA]. The study design was limited to randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and the intervention was IV amino acids. Eligible procedures for cardiac surgery included: CABG; valve surgeries; thoracic or thoracoabdominal aortic replacement; aortic replacement procedures (e.g., ascending aorta replacement); congenital defect repairs (e.g., atrial septal defect closure); pulmonary valve replacement (PVR); arrhythmia-related procedures (e.g., atrial fibrillation ablation). Procedures unrelated to the primary cardiac structure (e.g., catheter-based interventions without surgical repair) were excluded.Two authors [AH, AM] independently extracted data into a pre-established data collection form in Microsoft Excel. Any disagreement was settled by a third author [AA]. The following items, when available, were extracted: study characteristics (i.e., first author, publication date, study setting, study design and sample size); patient characteristics (i.e., age, sex, body mass index, serum creatinine, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and type of surgery); post-allocation characteristics (i.e., dose of amino acids, duration of infusion, duration of cardiopulmonary bypass [CBP] and cross-clamp time); outcomes (i.e., AKI, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes [KDIGO] stage of AKI and use of kidney replacement therapy). Primary outcome of the meta-analysis was number of patients with AKI, assessed as a binary outcome (yes/no) and using the KDIGO definition of AKI. KDIGO defines AKI as any of the following: an increase in serum creatinine by ≥0.3 mg/dl (≥26.5 µmol/l) within 48 h; an increase in serum creatinine to ≥1.5 times baseline within the previous 7 days; urine volume ≤0.5 ml/kg/h for 6 h.\n15\n The secondary outcomes were number of patients with KDIGO stage 1, 2 or 3 and use of kidney replacement therapy.Statistical analysisThe meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager (RevMan) [Computer program] Version 5.4.1. Copenhagen: The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration 2020. A P value <0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.The level of evidence quality of each study was estimated according to the guidelines of Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE).\n16\n The GRADEpro GDT software, a tool specifically designed for implementing GRADE criteria was used, which facilitates summarizing evidence in a transparent and standardized manner. The software allows for evaluating critical aspects of the evidence, including risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias. By applying these criteria, we derived the certainty ratings ranging from high to moderate based on the strength and limitations of the evidence.The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials (ROB 2.0) was used to assess the quality of each included RCT.\n17\n ROB 2.0 evaluates the quality of the RCT across five domains (i.e., randomization process; deviations from intended interventions; missing outcome data; measurement of the outcome; selection of the reported result). Based on answers, risk of bias was categorized as high, low, or some concern. The risk of bias in each study was independently assessed by two authors [AMM, IAS]. Any disagreement was settled by a third author [AA].The DerSimonian and Laird random effects model was used to pool the risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and the combined data was visually represented using forest plots. Cochran's Q test and Higgins' I2 statistical test were used to assess the statistical heterogeneity of the pooled results. If I2 statistic ≥50% and P < 0.05, a random effects model was applied to the data. If no heterogeneity was observed, a fixed effect model was used.\n18\nResultsThe literature search identified 6099 articles from which three articles13,19,20 ultimately met the eligibility criteria (Figure 1). The main features of the three studies are summarized in Table 1 and Table 2. In total, 3646 patients were involved. One study was carried out in Italy, Croatia, and Singapore, another in Japan, and a third in Australia. Ages across the three studies varied from 52 to 77 years, with median ages for the intervention group being 72, 66, and 71 years, respectively, and for the control group, 71, 67, and 72 years. Cardiac surgeries included: CABG; mitral valve repair; aortic valve repair; total aortic arch replacement (TAAR); thoracoabdominal aortic replacement (TAAAR). All three RCTs used KDIGO criteria for AKI assessment. Control groups received, Ringer’s solution, crystalloid infusion or standard care.Figure 1.Flow diagram of included and excluded studies.Table 1.Characteristics of the included studies.Study IDStudy DesignStudy SettingNo patientsAmino AcidsControlPrimary OutcomeMethod of AKI AssessmentTime of AKI AssessmentFollow-up durationFormDoseDurationLandoni, 2024\n19\nMC, DB, RCTItaly, Croatia, Singapore3511Continuous IV infusion2 g/kg ideal body weight3 daysRinger’s solutionOccurrence of AKIKDIGO Creatinine CriteriaWithin first week after surgery6 monthsKazawa, 2024\n20\nSC, patient and assessor-blinded, RCTJapan66IV infusion20 g every 8 h3 daysCrystalloid infusionOccurrence of AKIKDIGO CriteriaWithin first week after surgery3 monthsPu, 2024\n13\nSC, pilot RCTAustralia69Continuous IV infusion42 ml/h to achieve a daily protein intake of at least 100 g/dayAfter anesthetic induction to discharge from ICU/HDU to wardStandard careDuration of renal dysfunction, duration and severity of AKI, eGFR, Urine output, Use of kidney replacement therapyKDIGO CriteriaWithin first week after surgery3 monthsAbbreviations: MC, multicentre; DB, double blind; RCT, Randomized Controlled Trial; SC, single centre; IV, intravenous; AKI, acute kidney injury; KDIGO, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes; eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate; ICU, intensive care unit; HDU, high dependency unit.Table 2.Clinical and demographic characteristics of the patients.Landoni, 2024\n19\nKazawa, 2024\n20\nPu, 2019\n13\nInterventionControlInterventionControlInterventionControlNo. patients1759175233323336M/F1229/5301225/52716/1721/1119/1431/5BMI, kg/m226 [23–29]26 [23–28]22.2 [20.4–25.7]21.3 [19.0–25.2]NRNRCreatinine, mg/dl0.96 [0.81–1.11]0.94 [0.81–1.10]0.79 [0.66–0.93]0.87 [0.70–1.14]1.29 [0.99–1.59]1.19 [0.95–1.43]LVEF, %59 [54–63]60 [54–63]60 [60–65]61 [59–65]56.1 [49.7–62.5]56.9 [50.4–63.4]SurgeryCABG, MV, AVCABG, MV, AVTAAR, TAAARTAAR, TAAARCABG, ValvesCABG, ValvesAmino acid, ml1260 [1000–2592]N/A46.7 [40.0–60.0] g/dayN/A223 [176.4–269.6]N/ADuration of infusion, h30 [25–56]N/ANRN/A5.3 [4.2–6.4]N/ADuration of CPB, min93 [73–121]V242 [226–275]287 [227–338]NRNRCross clamp time, minNRNR134 [102–182]167 [111–230]112 [77–147]136 [88–184]Comorbidities, nHypertension: 1090 (62)MI: 268 (15)AF: 300 (17)Stroke/TIA: 78 (4)Diabetes: 309 (18)PVD: 307 (17)Cardiac Surgery: 147 (8)Hypertension: 1083 (62)MI: 256 (15)AF: 287 (16)Stroke/TIA: 87 (5)Diabetes: 335 (19)PVD: 340 (19)Cardiac Surgery: 139 (8)Hypertension: 24 (73)Diabetes: 4 (12)Thoracic surgery: 10 (30)Hypertension: 21 (66)Diabetes: 3 (9)Thoracic surgery: 9 (28)Hypertension: 29 (88)Diabetes requiring insulin: 7 (21)MI: 7 (21)PVD: 3 (9)Cardiac surgery: 4 (12)CHF: 24 (73)Hypertension: 33 (92)Diabetes requiring insulin: 5 (14)MI: 12 (33)PVD: 10 (28)Cardiac surgery: 7 (19)CHF: 22 (61)Data are expressed as n, n (%), or median [interquartile range]Abbreviations: M, male; F, female; BMI, body mass index; LVEF, left ventricular ejection fraction; CPB, cardiopulmonary bypass; CABG, coronary artery bypass graft; MV, Mitral valve; AV, aortic valve; MI, myocardial infarction; AF, atrial fibrillation; TIA, transient ischemic attack; PVD, peripheral vascular disease; TAAR, thoracic aortic replacement; TAAAR, thoracoabdominal aortic replacement; NR, not reported; N/A. not applicable; CHF, congestive heart failure.According to the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials (ROB 2.0) one study was judged to be at low risk of bias in all domains,\n19\n while the other two studies,13,20 showed some concerns of bias in one domain. However, all three RCTs showed a low risk of bias arising from the randomization process, a low risk of bias due to missing outcome data, and a low risk of bias in the measurement of the outcome. A graphical summary of the risk of bias assessment within each study as well as a combined graphical summary of risk of bias within each domain is shown in Figure 2. According to the GRADE assessment for level of evidence quality, there was moderate certainty for the majority of the outcomes, high certainty for stage 1 AKI, and low certainty for kidney replacement therapy.Figure 2.Graphical summary of risk of bias within each domain according to Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials (ROB 2.0).\n17\n (a) Summary Plot and (b) Traffic Light Plot.In terms of the primary outcome, the incidence of AKI, the pooled outcome of the three studies showed that IV amino acids were comparable with control therapy (RR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.52, 1.04; P = 0.08; I2 = 35%) (Figure 3).Figure 3.Forest plot evaluating the effects of IV amino acids by comparison with control measures (i.e., Ringer’s solution, crystalloid infusion, standard care) on the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI).In terms of the secondary outcome, the number of patients with Stage 1 AKI, the pooled outcome of the three studies showed that IV amino acids were significantly superior to control therapy (RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.78, 0.97; P = 0.01; I2  = 0%) (Figure 4).Figure 4.Forest plot evaluating the effects of IV amino acids by comparison with control measures (i.e., Ringer’s solution, crystalloid infusion, standard care) on the incidence of Stage 1 AKI.For the number of patients with Stage 2 AKI, the pooled outcome of the three studies showed that IV amino acids were comparable with control therapy (RR, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.60, 2.56; P = 0.57; I2 = 0%) (Figure 5).Figure 5.Forest plot evaluating the effects of IV amino acids by comparison with control measures (i.e., Ringer’s solution, crystalloid infusion, standard care) on the incidence of Stage 2 AKI.For the number of patients with Stage 3 AKI, the pooled outcome of the three studies showed that IV amino acids were significantly superior to control therapy (RR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.34, 0.83; P = 0.005; I2 = 0%) (Figure 6).Figure 6.Forest plot evaluating the effects of IV amino acids by comparison with control measures (i.e., Ringer’s solution, crystalloid infusion, standard care) on the incidence of Stage 3 AKI.In terms of the secondary outcome, the number of patients that used kidney replacement therapy, the pooled outcome of the three studies showed that IV amino acids were comparable with control therapy (RR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.22, 3.37; P = 0.83; I2 = 48%) (Figure 7).Figure 7.Forest plot evaluating the effects of IV amino acids by comparison with control measures (i.e., Ringer’s solution, crystalloid infusion, standard care) on the incidence of Kidney Replacement Therapy.The analysis was repeated after excluding one study that was a significant contributor to the overall weight of the analysis.\n19\n Results of this sensitivity analysis showed that IV amino acids significantly reduced the risk of AKI (RR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.30, 0.90; P = 0.02; I2 = 0%). However, no significant difference was observed between intervention and control for number of patients with Stage 1 AKI (RR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.34, 1.31; P = 0.24; I2 = 0%), Stage 2 AKI (RR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.08, 4.98; P = 0.66; I2 = 0%), Stage 3 AKI (RR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.02, 1.83; P = 0.16, I2 = 0%), and use of kidney replacement therapy (RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.03, 25.97, P = 0.95, I2 = 71%).DiscussionFollowing cardiovascular surgery, AKI is a common complication that affects more than 40% of patients who have undergone CPB.\n6\n Our meta-analysis showed that IV amino acid infusions during cardiac surgery significantly lowered the risk of Stage 1 and Stage 3 AKI. However, the treatment had no significant impact on Stage 2 AKI and need for kidney replacement therapy. These findings suggest that IV amino acids provide targeted protection, particularly in the early and severe stages of AKI, and could be a valuable addition to strategies aimed at preventing severe kidney complications after cardiac surgery.The main cause of AKI is kidney hypoperfusion.\n21\n Reduced cardiac output following surgery frequently makes AKI worse by decreasing kidney perfusion and raising afferent arteriolar resistance via vasopressor use. This can lead to oliguria and reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The complex interaction of preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative factors that impair kidney function contributes to the multifaceted nature of AKI.\n22\nDespite advances in our understanding and management of AKI, effective preventive measures remain limited. Established approaches concentrate on supportive measures, but specific and effective approaches are needed.\n23\n IV amino acid infusions are one such method that has attracted attention. Initial studies have suggested that these infusions may help preserve kidney function during critical illness\n12\n and after cardiac surgery.\n13\n Kidney blood flow and function may be improved by amino acid infusion through the activation of kidney functional reserves,\n24\n lowering of afferent arteriolar resistance,\n25\n and amplification of nitric oxide generation.\n26\n Studies in rats have demonstrated that amino acids infusion lowers afferent arteriolar resistance and nitric oxide has been demonstrated to mediate the hyperfiltration and vasodilation observed with amino acid infusion.25,26 While the precise mechanisms through which IV amino acids enhance kidney function remain unknown, it has been established in studies conducted in humans that the increase in GFR caused by amino acid infusion is accompanied by an increase in kidney plasma flow without a marked increase in filtration fraction (FF).\n24\n Therefore, it is believed the effect is due to afferent (pre-glomerular) arteriolar dilation.\n24\n The exact mechanisms causing this vasodilation are not fully understood but evidence indicates that neither the direct vasodilatory effects of amino acids on the blood vessels, nor their metabolism in the liver or the release of hormonal factors from the liver, are likely to be significant contributors. One suggested mechanism for this vasodilatory effect is that an increase in the filtered load of amino acids reduces distal tubular NaCl delivery by enhancing its reabsorption in the proximal tubules. This is detected by the macula densa which leads to inhibition of the tubule-glomerular feedback, thus causing vasodilatation of the afferent arterioles.\n24\nPre-existing kidney dysfunction, such as chronic kidney disease (CKD), is recognized as a risk factor for AKI in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.\n27\n While IV amino acid infusion has shown potential for increasing kidney blood flow and GFR, this effect primarily benefits kidneys with sufficient residual nephron mass. Consequently, in the case of severe pre-existing structural nephropathy, where nephron mass is significantly reduced, amino acid infusion may not reduce the incidence of postoperative AKI.\n28\n Further research and large-scale studies are required to substantiate this observation and fully understand the role of amino acids in this patient population. However, in a study involving 474 critically ill patients in ICU who were randomized to either standard care or IV amino acid supplementation, in those with normal kidney function at baseline, amino acid supplementation significantly reduced 90-day mortality and improved eGFR.\n29\n In addition, long-term IV amino acid supplementation has been shown to improve kidney function, as evidenced by increased eGFR and urine output, although it does not appear to impact the duration of kidney dysfunction in critically ill patients.\n12\n Furthermore, animal studies indicate that high levels of aromatic amino acids can have a protective effect on CKD.\n30\n Given the established link between AKI and development of subsequent CKD, these findings highlight the potential of amino acid supplementation to reduce acute kidney injury and prevent long-term complications associated with CKD.\n30\nAn important aspect of our meta-analysis is that all three RCTs used the KDIGO criteria to assess AKI. This consistency enhances the reliability and comparability of our meta-analysis, ensuring accurate conclusions about the impact of IV amino acids on kidney outcomes in cardiac surgery patients. Although not achieving statistical significance, the pooled analysis of three studies revealed an RR of 0.73 for AKI, showing a trend toward reduction of AKI risk with IV amino acids. Moreover, our findings are consistent with those of another meta-analysis that examined amino acid infusion for perioperative kidney protection, specifically focusing on AKI in a cardiac surgery subgroup.\n31\n The consistency of results across both meta-analyses reinforces the evidence suggesting a potential kidney-protective effect of amino acid infusion in cardiac surgery patients. However, since the results did not reach statistical significance, this conclusion cannot be made and further large scale RCTs are needed to make definitive conclusions. Following the exclusion of one study that was a significant contributor to the overall weight of the analysis,\n19\n our sensitivity analyses found that IV amino acids significantly reduced the risk of AKI. This result further underscores the need for additional large-scale, double-blind RCTs to determine the true effect of amino acids on AKI outcomes.As demonstrated by a large multicentre study involving 3,500 patients undergoing cardiac surgery, Stage 1 AKI is a frequent complication following such procedures.\n32\n Any intervention that prevents Stage 1 AKI would benefit a significant number of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Our meta-analysis showed a significant protective effect of IV amino acids in terms of Stage 1 AKI. However, a subsequent sensitivity analysis excluding one study,\n19\n found that IV amino acids no longer showed a beneficial effect indicating that this single study heavily influenced the overall effect of our analysis. Therefore, caution is required when interpreting our results, and emphasises the need for further well-powered studies to validate the protective effect of IV amino acids on Stage 1 AKI. With regard to Stage 2, AKI, we found that no difference between the IV amino acids and control measures. A subsequent sensitivity analysis confirmed these findings. For Stage 3 AKI, we found a significant protective effect of IV amino acids in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Indeed, by comparison with the control group, patients receiving IV amino acids had a 47% lower risk of having Stage 3 AKI. However, a subsequent sensitivity analysis excluding one study\n19\n, found that IV amino acids no longer showed a beneficial effect suggesting that the inclusion that study influenced the significant effect on Stage 3 AKI.With regard to kidney replacement therapy, our meta-analysis found no difference between IV amino acids and control measures. The moderate level of heterogeneity (i.e., I2 = 48%) suggested variability in study results, which may be due to differences in the criteria for initiating kidney replacement therapy or the severity of AKI. A previous study indicated that 1.4% of patients who underwent CABG required continuous kidney replacement therapy as a result of AKI.\n33\n In another study, kidney replacement therapy was required for three patients in the control group, and none in the IV amino acid group, suggesting the IV amino acids have a potential protective effect.\n20\n However, the low sample size and number of events in that study suggest it could be a random finding and warrants further investigation.Our meta-analysis had several limitations. For example, it was based on an analysis of only three studies, which may limit the generalizability of the findings and reduce the statistical power to detect meaningful differences across the outcomes. In addition, most patients included in the meta-analysis were from one large RCT.\n19\n Consequently, this study made a large contribution to the overall results, which also limits the generalizability of our findings. Furthermore, we only included RCTs and excluded cohort studies. This decision may have excluded important patient data that could have offered additional context. Also, some of the individual studies had wide confidence intervals, which suggests that their effect size was uncertain. More research involving additional studies is required to validate our findings.In conclusion, this systematic review and meta-analysis showed that IV amino acids may provide protective benefits against AKI Stages 1 and 3 in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. However, no significant difference between amino acids and control measures was shown for prevention of overall AKI, Stage 3 AKI or kidney replacement therapy. Although our meta-analysis was based on just three studies, its focus on including only RCTs ensured a high level of evidence, minimized bias, and offered a robust foundation for clinical guidelines.Supplemental Materialsj-pdf-1-imr-10.1177_03000605251315919 - Supplemental material for Intravenous amino acids for kidney protection in patients undergoing cardiac surgery: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trialsSupplemental material, sj-pdf-1-imr-10.1177_03000605251315919 for Intravenous amino acids for kidney protection in patients undergoing cardiac surgery: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials by Malik Waleed Zeb Khan, Aizaz Ali, Amna Hussain, Aban Masaud Mian, Abdul Moeez, Waqas Inayat, Bushra Noor, Izhar Ali Shah, Muhammad Osama, Bushra Khan, Muhammad Sajid, Touba Azeem, Mohammad Ebad Ur Rehman, Ashraf Ali and Ubaid Khan Afridi in Journal of International Medical Research"}

This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the association between neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and mortality in TAVI patients. We searched major databases from January 2010 to November 2024, including studies examining pre-procedural NLR and mortality outcomes in TAVI patients. Eight retrospective studies comprising 9,948 participants were included. The follow-up duration ranged from three to 36 months. Meta-analysis using a random-effects model revealed that elevated NLR was significantly associated with increased mortality risk (RR: 1.37, 95% CI: 1.08-1.74). Substantial heterogeneity was observed (I-square: 77.3%). Meta-regression analysis identified follow-up duration as a significant predictor explaining 62.5% of the heterogeneity, while other variables including age, gender, diabetes, and hypertension showed minimal impact. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated the robustness of findings, with no individual study significantly influencing the overall effect size. The association between elevated NLR and increased mortality risk may be explained by neutrophils' role in inflammatory responses and tissue damage, coupled with reduced lymphocyte-mediated immune regulation. Despite limitations including NLR cut-off variations and heterogeneity in study designs, our findings suggest that NLR serves as a valuable prognostic marker for mortality risk in TAVI patients. Future research should focus on standardizing NLR thresholds and exploring subgroup-specific effects to enhance its clinical utility.", "body": "Introduction and backgroundTranscatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has revolutionized the management of severe aortic stenosis, offering a minimally invasive alternative to traditional surgical aortic valve replacement, particularly for patients at high surgical risk [1]. Despite advancements in TAVI techniques and technology, predicting outcomes and identifying patients at increased risk of adverse events post-procedure remains a significant clinical challenge [2]. In recent years, systemic inflammation has emerged as a crucial determinant of prognosis in cardiovascular diseases, including TAVI, because it plays a pivotal role in both acute and chronic disease processes. Inflammation influences vascular remodeling, endothelial function, and immune responses, all of which are critical in cardiovascular health [3]. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), a marker of systemic inflammation, has gained attention for its prognostic value in various clinical settings like cancer (e.g., lung, colorectal, and gastric cancer), infectious diseases (e.g., sepsis, COVID-19), chronic inflammatory diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease), acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). In these settings, elevated NLR is associated with poorer outcomes, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker across multiple clinical scenarios [4]. NLR is calculated by dividing the number of neutrophils by the number of lymphocytes in a patient's blood, providing a simple yet insightful indicator of the balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses [5]. Elevated preoperative NLR values have been associated with increased morbidity and mortality in cardiac surgery patients [6]. However, the predictive power of NLR on outcomes specifically in patients undergoing TAVI, particularly focusing on mortality, is less well-characterized and warrants further investigation [7-8]. Systemic inflammation plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of adverse outcomes following TAVI. Factors such as periprocedural myocardial injury, vascular trauma, and the host response to bioprosthetic valves may trigger an exaggerated inflammatory state, contributing to complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and valve dysfunction [9]. NLR, as a composite marker of inflammation and immune status, could provide insights into the underlying mechanisms linking inflammation to poor clinical outcomes [10-11]. Predicting adverse events such as valve dysfunction, mortality, and heart failure post-TAVI remains challenging due to the heterogeneity of patient profiles, including advanced age and comorbidities [8]. Systemic inflammation is uniquely significant in TAVI compared to other cardiovascular procedures because it exacerbates procedural stress, affects tissue healing, and impacts bioprosthetic valve durability [9-11]. This inflammation often reflects pre-existing conditions or procedural factors, influencing outcomes. Research in this area is complicated by conflicts such as variations in NLR thresholds, inconsistent definitions of key outcomes, and differences in follow-up durations. These discrepancies hinder the development of standardized predictive models for post-TAVI events.While individual studies have reported conflicting results regarding the prognostic value of NLR in TAVI patients, a systematic evaluation of the available evidence is essential to establish its role as a reliable marker of mortality risk. A meta-analytic approach allows for the synthesis of data from diverse populations and methodological contexts, providing a more robust and generalizable assessment. This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to evaluate the effect of NLR on mortality in patients undergoing TAVI. Specifically, it seeks to determine whether elevated pre- or postprocedural NLR is associated with increased short- and long-term mortality risk, and to explore potential heterogeneity in this association across different patient subgroups and study designs. Understanding the prognostic significance of NLR may have important implications for risk stratification, early intervention, and improving outcomes in TAVI patients. ReviewMethodology Information Sources and Search Strategy A comprehensive literature search was conducted from January 1, 2010, to November 30, 2024, across multiple electronic databases, including PubMed (MEDLINE), Scopus, Web of Science, and EMBASE. The search strategy was designed to capture all relevant studies examining the relationship between NLR and mortality in patients after TAVI, combining Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and keywords: (\"Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio\" OR \"NLR\" OR \"Systemic Inflammation\") AND (\"Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation\" OR \"TAVI\" OR \"Aortic Valve Replacement, Transcatheter\") AND (\"Mortality\" OR \"Survival\" OR \"Outcome\"). Additionally, hand searching of relevant journals, screening of reference lists from included studies, and a grey literature search were performed to minimize the risk of omitting pertinent studies. The search was performed by two authors independently. Any disagreement between two authors was resolved through discussion. Eligibility Criteria and Study Selection Studies were deemed eligible for inclusion if they met specific criteria: focusing on adults undergoing TAVI, examining pre-procedural NLR, and reporting mortality as an outcome, with eligible study designs including observational studies (cohort, case-control) irrespective of the duration of follow-up. Exclusion criteria consisted of non-English publications, inaccessible full-texts, studies not reporting mortality, and non-original research such as reviews, editorials, case reports, or conference abstracts without corresponding full-text publications. The screening process involved two independent reviewers assessing titles and abstracts, resolving discrepancies through consensus or consultation with a third reviewer, followed by full-text evaluation of potentially eligible studies. Data Extraction and Quality Assessment Data extraction was meticulously performed using a pre-designed spreadsheet, capturing essential study characteristics (e.g., author, year, sample size, region, and NLR measurement) and outcomes. The methodological quality and risk of bias of included studies were assessed utilizing the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for observational studies facilitating the evaluation of the evidence's reliability and robustness. Data Analysis All statistical analyses were conducted using RStudio (Posit PBC, Boston, MA, USA) using the R meta package (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria), with the primary objective of synthesizing the association between pre-procedural NLR and mortality in TAVI patients. The meta-analysis employed a random-effects model to account for between-study heterogeneity, quantifying the pooled effect size via odds ratios (OR) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). We used the Knapp-Hartung adjustment to calculate CI as this methodology is usually applied for smaller sample sizes, thus, providing more conservative confidence intervals, reinforcing result reliability. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I-square statistic, with sensitivity tests planned to explore potential sources of heterogeneity and the robustness of the findings, respectively. We used leave-out sensitivity analysis to assess how the exclusion of any study impacts the overall effect of NLR on mortality.Results From electronic databases, we identified 758 records. After removing duplicates, 702 studies were screened using their titles and abstracts. Full text of 19 studies was obtained and detailed assessment of their eligibility criteria was done. Finally, eight studies were included in this meta-analysis. A detailed description of how the studies were selected is presented in Figure 1. Figure 1Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow showing study selection processStudy Characteristics The characteristics of individual studies are shown in Table 1. Eight studies including 9948 participants reported the relationship of NLR and mortality. Follow-up of individual studies ranged from three months to 36 months. All included studies were retrospective. Four studies were conducted in the United States, two in Australia, and one each in Israel and China. Table 1Included studies characteristicsNR: Not reportedAuthorRegionStudy DesignSample SizeType of MeasureFollow-up durationageMaleDiabetesHypertensionAbushouk et al., 2022 [12]United StatesRetrospective908Adjusted30 MonthsNRNRNRNRCondado et al., 2013 [13]United StatesRetrospective520Adjusted12 Months83263219501Gao et al., 2024 [14]ChinaRetrospective124Adjusted3 Months79.07623681Habib et al., 2018 [15]United StatesRetrospective335Adjusted36 Months70.6113684186Merdler et al., 2022 [16]IsraelRetrospective1152Adjusted36 Months82.9509419987Nair et al., 2022 [17]AustraliaRetrospective304Adjusted17 MonthsNRNRNRNRNair et al., 2024 [7]AustraliaRetrospective367Adjusted12 Months84189115289Shahim et al., 2022 [18]United StatesRetrospective5881Adjusted24 Months83327221185452Effect of NLR on Risk of Mortality in Patients With TAVI Figure 2 presents the pooled analysis assessing the impact of high NLR on all-cause mortality in patients undergoing TAVI. Pooled analysis of eight studies showed that high NLR is associated with increased risk of mortality (RR: 1.37, 95% CI: 1.08 to 1.74). High heterogeneity was reported among the study results (I-square: 77.3%). To identify the study causing high heterogeneity among the study results, we performed leave-one-out analysis leaving one study at a time. The results of the sensitivity analysis are shown in Figure 3. This forest plot shows that omitting any individual study from the meta-analysis has minimal impact on the overall effect size (RR), with I² values remaining consistently high (70-80%) across all leave-one-out analyses. Figure 2Comparing the effect of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) on mortalityRR: Risk ratio; CI: Confidence interval; HK: Knapp-Hartung adjustmentSources: References [7,18]Figure 3Sensitivity Analysis: Removing One Study at a TimeRR: Risk ratioTo identify whether any study is an outlier, i.e. defined as any study that shows a substantial influence on the model results when removed, where \"substantial\" typically means causing a shift in the combined effect estimate outside the original confidence interval, we used \"find.outliers\" function within \"dmetar\" in R. We did not identify any outlier study. This finding is supported by our leave-one-out analysis Figure 3, which demonstrates that removing individual studies did not substantially alter the pooled effect estimate, with the estimates remaining stable across all iterations. Meta-Regression Table 2 presents the results of the meta-regression analysis examining the effect of various predictors on the relationship between NLR and mortality. The year of publication does not significantly impact this relationship, as indicated by a non-significant p-value and an R-square value of 0%, suggesting it does not account for any heterogeneity in the data. Follow-up duration, however, is a statistically significant predictor, with a positive estimate, and it explains a substantial portion of the heterogeneity (62.50%). Age, while showing a negative estimate, is not significantly associated with mortality outcomes, and it accounts for 4% of the heterogeneity. Gender (male), diabetes, and hypertension all show negligible effects on the NLR-mortality relationship, as evidenced by their non-significant p-values and R-square values of 0%, indicating that they do not explain any meaningful variation in the data. Overall, the meta-regression suggests that follow-up duration may be an important factor in the relationship between NLR and mortality, while other variables like age, gender, diabetes, and hypertension appear to have little impact. Table 2Results of Meta-Regression Analysis: Predictors of Study OutcomesR-Square: amount of heterogeneity accounted forVariableEstimateP-valueR-SquareYear of publication-0.01430.66580%Follow-up duration0.01340.036562.50%Age-0.060.22694.00%Gender (Male)0.00010.59410%Diabetes0.00010.58840%Hypertension0.00010.59370%Effect of Follow-Up Duration on Relationship Between NLR and MortalityThis bubble plot in Figure 4 displays the relationship between follow-up duration (x-axis) and risk ratio (y-axis) across different studies, where the size of each bubble represents the study's weight in the meta-analysis. There appears to be a slight positive trend line, suggesting that the risk ratio tends to increase with longer follow-up periods. Notably, Habib et al. (2018) appears as an outlier with a much higher risk ratio (~4.5) compared to other studies as the study follow-up is larger, while most studies cluster between risk ratios of 1 to 2. Figure 4Bubble plot assessing the effect of follow-up on study outcomeDiscussion Our meta-analysis, which included eight cohort studies, demonstrates that the NLR is a significant predictor of all-cause mortality in patients undergoing TAVI. Patients with elevated NLR had a notably higher risk of mortality, with an RR of 1.37 (95% CI: 1.08 to 1.74). Similarly, a meta-analysis by Wang et al., which encompassed 10 cohort studies, found that NLR is a reliable predictor of both all-cause mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in individuals undergoing angiography or cardiac revascularization. In their analysis, patients in the highest NLR category faced a significantly higher risk of mortality (RR: 2.33, 95% CI: 1.88-2.88) and cardiovascular events (RR: 1.89, 95% CI: 1.42-2.52) compared to those in the lowest NLR category. These findings further support the role of NLR as an important biomarker for predicting adverse outcomes in cardiovascular patients. Several factors could explain why an increased NLR is associated with higher all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events. Neutrophils play a critical role in the inflammatory response to acute myocardial injury through various biochemical mechanisms, which can contribute to further tissue damage. These mechanisms include the release of reactive oxygen species, myeloperoxidase, and proteolytic enzymes, which facilitate plaque disruption [19]. In contrast, lymphocytes are involved in regulating the immune system's response [20-22]. However, inflammation has been shown to promote lymphocyte apoptosis, reducing their effectiveness in controlling the immune response [23]. Thus, the combination of elevated neutrophil levels and reduced lymphocyte counts into a single composite marker of inflammation, such as NLR, can provide valuable prognostic information. This imbalance may contribute to an increased risk of adverse outcomes, including all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events, highlighting the importance of NLR as a marker of inflammatory status in cardiovascular disease [19]. NLR is an unspecific indicator of systemic inflammation, reflecting the ratio between two distinct types of leukocytes: neutrophils, which are involved in the innate, non-specific immune response, and lymphocytes, which play a role in the adaptive, regulatory immune pathway. A key challenge in utilizing NLR as a prognostic tool in disease processes is identifying an optimal cut-off value that differentiates disease outcomes. This cut-off value is likely to vary depending on factors such as the stage of the illness, the laboratory methods used, concurrent infections, and the demographic characteristics of the patient population [24]. Several government-approved clinical trials are currently exploring the role of NLR in various cardiovascular diseases and publishing their findings in reputable scientific journals. One such example is the Prospective Multicenter Observational Study of Patients with Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (UMIN000021831), which included 1,026 participants. In this study, elevated levels of NLR (>4.5) at admission were independently linked to an increased risk of cardiac death [25]. An earlier study (NCT01663194) aimed to demonstrate the relationship between long-term outcomes for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and pre-procedural NLR in the hospital [26]. The current meta-analysis revealed substantial heterogeneity across the study results, highlighting significant variation in the relationship between NLR and mortality. Despite all the studies showing a positive association between NLR and mortality, there were differences in the magnitude of this effect, suggesting that other factors might be contributing to the observed variability. To explore potential sources of this heterogeneity, we conducted a meta-regression analysis, focusing on various study characteristics that could influence the NLR-mortality relationship. Our findings suggest that the follow-up duration is a key factor explaining the high level of heterogeneity. Studies with longer follow-up periods were associated with a higher reported mortality rate, which may reflect the cumulative effect of NLR on mortality over time. In fact, follow-up duration accounted for 62.5% of the heterogeneity observed in the studies. This suggests that the length of time over which mortality is assessed plays a crucial role in moderating the observed effect of NLR on mortality outcomes. Longer follow-up periods may capture more mortality events and reflect cumulative inflammatory burdens, with chronic inflammation potentially altering the relationship between NLR and outcomes [16]. Additionally, changes in baseline inflammatory markers over time could amplify NLR’s predictive strength. This meta-analysis acknowledges several limitations. One of the primary concerns is the variation in the levels of NLR across the studies included, which may contribute to inconsistencies in the overall findings. Furthermore, substantial heterogeneity was observed in the pooled analysis of all-cause mortality. The majority of the studies were retrospective observation, which is associated with potential selection bias. While we were able to identify the main source of this heterogeneity through sensitivity analyses and meta-regression, the inability to conduct subgroup analyses due to insufficient data remains a limitation. This lack of subgroup data prevents a deeper exploration of the factors that could further explain the observed variability in the NLR-mortality relationship. Lastly, the majority of these studies were conducted in the United States and other developed countries and cannot be generalized to populations in low- and middle-income countries. Despite these limitations, the study provides valuable insights into the association between NLR and mortality, though future research with more uniform data and subgroup analyses would help clarify the underlying mechanisms and refine the conclusions. ConclusionsThis meta-analysis of eight studies encompassing 9,948 TAVI patients demonstrates that elevated NLR is significantly associated with increased mortality risk (RR: 1.37, 95% CI: 1.08-1.74). Follow-up duration emerged as a crucial moderator, explaining 62.5% of the observed heterogeneity. The relationship between elevated NLR and mortality is likely mediated through inflammatory mechanisms, with neutrophils promoting tissue damage while reduced lymphocytes impair immune regulation. Despite study limitations, NLR shows promise as a practical prognostic marker for TAVI patients. Future research should focus on standardizing NLR thresholds and investigating subgroup-specific effects to enhance its clinical application."}
{"PMCID": "11900810", "title": "What is the Impact of Endothelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition in Solid Tumours: A Qualitative Systematic Review and Quantitative Meta-Analysis", "abstract": "Endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) has gained increasing recognition as a crucial mechanism in the progression of solid cancers, influencing tumour heterogeneity, metastasis, and resistance to therapy. However, despite its growing importance, EndMT remains insufficiently studied within the cancer research landscape.In this study, we conduct a systematic review, adhered to the 2020 PRISMA guidelines, of the existing literature on EndMT in solid tumours, examining its functional roles, key biomarkers, underlying mechanisms, experimental models, and potential as a target for therapeutic intervention. Our objective was to identify critical areas where further research is needed. In addition, we performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the variability in the expression of EndMT-related markers and their potential links to patient prognosis.To this aim, literature searches were conducted in major databases including PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, covering studies published up to June 2024. The risk of bias of selected articles was evaluated using the OHAT tool, for the in vitro experiments and the SYRCLE tool for studies using animal models.Out of an initial pool of 1,197 articles, 54 studies were selected for data extraction by two independent reviewers. Selected studies were identified according to specific inclusion/exclusion criteria applied through distinct stages like “title and abstract screening”, “full text article review” and “article bibliography screening”. Our analysis confirms that EndMT is a key contributor to tumour progression and metastasis, but several aspects remain poorly understood, particularly regarding the induction of EndMT in specific cancer types, its role in lymphatic endothelial cells, and its interactions with other stromal elements. We observed substantial heterogeneity in the biomarkers associated with EndMT, as well as variations in the endothelial cell types studied, the functional outcomes, and the molecular mechanisms involved. Our meta-analysis revealed significant variability in the expression of EndMT biomarkers, with notable correlations between changes in the expression of specific genes and patient outcomes, particularly in lung cancer.In conclusion, it is essential for future research to focus on identifying the specific cancer and stromal cell types implicated in EndMT and to standardize endothelial cell models and protocols used for inducing EndMT. Investigating EndMT alongside well-established processes, such as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and exploring its relationship with cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) may provide valuable insights into its role in tumour biology and its impact on therapy resistance.", "body": "BackgroundResearch in cancer has made considerable progress in the past few decades, nevertheless each year its incidence and related mortality increases in certain tumour types, such as pancreatic cancer 1, melanoma 2 or uterine cancers 3, underscoring the ongoing limitations in our knowledge. Recently, the complexity of tumours, along with both inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity, has garnered increasing attention. It is now widely acknowledged that tumour growth and progression are not only driven by the cancerous cells themselves but also by the stromal components of the tumour microenvironment (TME), including cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) 4, tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) 5, and endothelial cells 6.Among the many processes involved in cancer, the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of tumour cells is one of the most extensively studied. EMT encompasses a dramatic transcriptional and phenotypic transformation in epithelial-like cancer cells, enabling them to acquire a migratory and pro-metastatic mesenchymal phenotype, exemplifying the remarkable plasticity of tumour biology 7. This molecular mechanism is closely linked to tumour progression, aggressiveness, drug resistance, and metastasis across a variety of cancers, including those of the liver 8, colon 9, lung 10, breast 11, and pancreas 12. Interestingly, stromal cells also undergo phenotypic alterations to support tumour growth, contributing to the TME in various ways. For example, CAFs often exhibit the overexpression of FAPα (fibroblast-associated protein alpha), a key marker linked to tumour progression and metastasis 13. Similarly, TAMs frequently undergo M2 polarization, a process that enhances their ability to promote immune suppression, tissue remodelling, and angiogenesis 14. These stromal modifications not only facilitate tumour cell proliferation but also enable the tumour to evade immune detection and resistance to therapeutic interventions, further complicating treatment strategies.Endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) is a process similar to EMT, in which endothelial cells lose their characteristic endothelial features and acquire a mesenchymal-like phenotype. This transition has been observed in various pathological conditions, including fibrosis 15, cerebral cavernous malformations 16, atherosclerosis 17, vascular hypertension 18, and cancer 19. However, EndMT in the context of cancer is less well characterized than EMT. In fact, much of the research connecting endothelial cells to cancer has focused primarily on tumour angiogenesis, because this process is essential for providing the oxygen and nutrients required for tumour growth and metastasis 20. Consequently, research has largely concentrated on profiling this abnormal vasculature and developing therapeutic strategies aimed at normalizing tumour blood vessels 21. Nonetheless, growing experimental evidence underscores the broader role of endothelial cells in the TME beyond angiogenesis. For instance, angiocrine factors secreted by endothelial cells (i.e. TIMP1 or IGFBP2) have been shown to promote the proliferation, migration, and drug resistance of glioblastoma cells 20. Additionally, a strong association between endothelial cells and CAFs has been established, with CAFs in lung cancer playing a key role in the formation of aberrant vasculature in solid tumours by generating a pro-inflammatory environment with elevated concentrations of several cytokines, including TNFα, TGFβ1, IFNγ, IL1β, and MCP1 22. This connection is further supported by evidence that the phenotypic plasticity of endothelial cells, induced by EndMT, is critical for the generation of CAFs 23. In this same study, the EndMT process has also been linked to the progression of pancreatic cancer and melanoma, as well as to the increased fibrosis of the surrounding stroma. Actually, the EndMT process has been linked to the progression of pancreatic cancer and melanoma, as well as to the increased fibrosis of the surrounding stroma 23. Moreover, the endothelial plasticity driven by EndMT, marked by the upregulation of mesenchymal markers such as αSMA (α-smooth muscle actin), FSP1 (fibroblast-specific protein 1), N-Cadherin, and SNAI2, has been associated with the emergence of chemoresistance in malignant cells, including resistance to temozolomide and anti-VEGF antibodies in glioblastoma 24. Undeniably, the critical role of EndMT (increasing vascular permeability and enhancing trans-endothelial migration of metastatic cells) in various cancer-related processes, including tumour progression and metastasis, has been clearly demonstrated, particularly in melanoma and breast cancer 25. Figure 1 illustrates the phenotypic plasticity linked to EndMT, which enables endothelial cells to adapt to distinct signaling cues within the TME, positioning EndMT as a dynamic and pivotal player in tumour biology.Given these insights, it is crucial to recognize the complexity and heterogeneity of EndMT across different tumour types. Understanding the molecular mechanisms driving EndMT and its interactions with the surrounding TME may be key to exploiting its plasticity as a therapeutic target. Therefore, the objective of this study was to conduct a qualitative systematic review to assess the current state of knowledge regarding EndMT in solid tumours. Specifically, we focused on experimental data examining the induction of EndMT in endothelial cells within the TME during tumour progression.In this study, we explored into several key aspects of the EndMT, focusing on critical biomarkers associated with this process. We also identified several key areas that remain underexplored, suggesting promising avenues for further research to deepen our understanding of this complex phenomenon. These insights could potentially open the door to innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at targeting EndMT-related pathways in cancer. To this end, we conducted a comprehensive quantitative meta-analysis, examining the expression patterns of EndMT-associated markers across a range of solid tumours. This analysis also aimed to explore the relationship between these markers and tumour progression, providing valuable information on how EndMT contributes to cancer development and metastasis.Materials and MethodsSearch methodology and data analysisThis review is not officially registered. It was conducted in accordance with the 2020 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines 26. Eligible publications focused on experimental data regarding the EndMT process in the context of solid tumours. Literature searches were performed using public databases such as PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science from inception until June 2024, employing the following search terms/strings: (“tumor*” OR “tumour*” OR “cancer*”) AND (“endothelial cell*” OR “EC” OR “tumor endothelial cell*” OR “tumour endothelial cell*” OR “cancer endothelial cell*” OR “tumor-derived endothelial cell*” OR “tumour-related endothelial cell*” OR “tumor-associated endothelial cell*” OR “tumour-derived endothelial cell*” OR “tumor-related endothelial cell*” OR “tumour-associated endothelial cell*” OR “cancer-derived endothelial cell*” OR “cancer-related endothelial cell*” OR “cancer-associated endothelial cell*” OR “TEC”) AND (“endothelial-mesenchymal transition*” OR “endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition*” OR “endothelial mesenchymal transition*” OR “endothelial to mesenchymal transition*” OR “EndMT*”).The bibliographies of selected studies were also reviewed to identify additional relevant articles. Publications were screened for eligibility according to specific inclusion and exclusion criteria (Table 1). The screening protocol and outcomes are illustrated in Figure 2. In total, 1,197 articles were initially obtained, and 54 papers were ultimately selected for data analysis. The screening process was completed by two independent investigators, and any discrepancies were resolved according to the criteria set by the senior researcher. Data were extracted from the selected studies based on pre-agreed fields by two independent authors, with discrepancies resolved following the senior researcher's criteria.Risk of biasQuality assessment of the selected in vitro studies was conducted using the Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT) risk of bias rating tool. The assessment focused on the following criteria: identical experimental conditions, blinding of researchers, completeness of outcome data, exposure characterization, outcome assessment, complete reporting of outcomes, and other potential threats (e.g., statistical issues) 27. For studies using animal models, the risk of bias was evaluated using the Systematic Review Center for Laboratory Animal Experimentation (SYRCLE) tool 28. The assessment focused on the following criteria: sequence generation (selection bias), baseline characteristics (selection bias), allocation concealment (selection bias), random housing (performance bias), blinding (performance bias), random outcome assessment (detection bias), blinding (detection bias), incomplete outcome data (attrition bias), selective outcome reporting (reporting bias). Quality assessments were independently performed by two researchers, with any discrepancies resolved by the senior investigator. All eligible studies were included in the results synthesis regardless of their risk of bias rating. The visualization of the risk of bias assessment was performed using the Robvis tool 29.Meta-analysisAnalysis of Gene Expression LevelsFor this meta-analysis, TCGA datasets corresponding to different cancer types were selected from UALCAN (http://ualcan.path.uab.edu), and specific biomarkers were evaluated for each cancer type. This analysis included both tumour samples and normal tissue controls across various cancer types. The selection criteria focused on cancers with well-defined cohorts. The number of patients in each group (tumour vs. control) for each cancer type is detailed in Table 2.For each cancer type, relevant biomarkers were selected based on their reported associations with cancer progression or prognosis. The primary metric used to summarize the data was the median expression level of the chosen biomarkers for each cancer type. Utilizing the median, rather than the mean, is particularly important in patient samples due to the presence of outliers and potential skewness in the data.HeatMap representation was created by calculating the Log2(Fold Change) between tumour samples and controls. Statistical analyses were conducted using tools provided by the UALCAN platform, which facilitates comparisons between normal and tumour samples through non-parametric tests. The differences in gene expression levels between control and tumour groups were evaluated using the Mann-Whitney U test, a non-parametric method appropriate for comparing medians in data that do not follow a normal distribution. Statistical significance was set at thresholds of p < 0.05 (), p < 0.01 (), and p < 0.001 ().Survival analysisTo evaluate the association between gene expression levels and patient survival, Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated using the KM Plotter web-based tool (https://kmplot.com/analysis/). This platform integrates gene expression data with survival information from various publicly available cancer datasets. For this study, we utilized the available datasets for colon cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, and gastric cancer, without applying any exclusion criteria to the patient data.Survival curves were plotted based on the median expression levels of selected genes of interest, dividing patients into two groups: high expression and low expression. Hazard ratios (HR), 95% confidence intervals (CI), and log-rank p-values were automatically calculated by the KM Plotter software and reported to assess statistical significance. All analyses were conducted using the default settings provided by the platform. The selected genes for this study are listed in Table 3.ResultsLiterature screening protocolThe search strategy outlined in the methods section yielded a total of 1,197 articles. After removing duplicates, 704 articles remained for further screening. We then screened the titles and abstracts of these studies, selecting those that met the inclusion criteria (Table 1). This process resulted in 159 papers being chosen for full-text screening based on the specified inclusion/exclusion criteria. Following this final screening stage, 51 articles were selected for complete data extraction and analysis. Additionally, we reviewed the bibliographies of these selected studies to identify more eligible articles, resulting in the inclusion of three additional studies during the “retrieval” phase. Consequently, a total of 54 studies were included for data analysis in the systematic review. Figure 2 illustrates the details of the screening process and appendix A shows the list of the selected articles.2. Risk of biasWe evaluated the features of each study design by conducting a risk of bias assessment. The domain of bias referring \"researcher blinding\" in the in vitro studies could not be evaluated due to insufficient information provided by almost all the studies. In terms of other criteria, the majority were classified as having a \"low risk\" of bias, as they utilized well-defined methodologies and thorough reporting. Only three studies were deemed to have a moderate risk, while four studies were identified as exhibiting a high risk (Figure 3A and C).In our systematic review of studies using animal models, none were identified as having a high risk of bias according to the SYRCLE tool. However, most studies lacked adequate information to evaluate critical aspects such as “allocation concealment,” “random housing,”, “blinding (performance bias)”, “random outcome assessment”, and “blinding (detection bias)”. Despite this, a significant proportion of the studies were classified as “low risk” in several areas, including “sequence generation”, “baseline characteristics of the animals”, “incomplete outcome data”, and “selective outcome reporting”. Overall, these studies provided limited information regarding animal selection strategies, performance methods, and whether researchers manipulating the animals were aware of group assignments (Figure 3B and D).Nomenclature and cancer type distribution in EndMT researchWe first examined the nomenclature used in each selected study to refer to the EndMT process, as the terminology employed in databases can significantly influence the studies analyzed. We observed a variety of terms referring to the same process (see Table 4), with “endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT)” being the most common. This nomenclature was adopted for the present article. Conversely, other terms such as “endothelial mesenchymal transition” 30 and “endothelial-mesenchymal transformation” 31 were less common. Notably, one study on breast cancer used the term “endothelial to mesenchymal transition” but employed the abbreviation “EMT” 32, highlighting a potential overlap between the concepts of EndMT and “epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)”. Indeed, we identified a potential source of confusion in the literature, as some studies initially seemed to meet our inclusion criteria but were ultimately excluded because they focused on the EMT phenomenon in cancerous cells, despite using the term \"endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition.\" 33,34. These findings underscore the need for careful analysis to distinguish between EndMT and EMT processes.Next, we assessed the cancer types addressed in each paper. As shown in Table 5, the EndMT process is most commonly studied in breast cancer. For example, one study found that tumour-associated endothelial cells (TECs) in breast cancer undergoing EndMT downregulated the endothelial-like marker PECAM1 and demonstrated enhanced migration and extracellular matrix remodeling capabilities compared to normal endothelial cells 35.In contrast, we discovered limited information on the induction of EndMT in certain tumours, such as esophageal adenocarcinoma 36 and nasopharyngeal carcinomas 37. Notably, we identified no experimental studies focusing on bladder, prostate or gastric cancer, indicating promising avenues for future research. For instance, gastric cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide 38, metastatic prostate cancer remains incurable 39, and secondary, highly aggressive bladder cancers frequently develop after radiotherapy for prostate tumours 40, along with the induction of EndMT by radiotherapy 41.It's worth mentioning that the same article examined EndMT across multiple cancer types, for example melanoma, breast and lung cancer, revealing a correlation between the induction of EndMT and a poor disease prognosis 42. Furthermore, most selected studies evaluated EndMT in blood vessel-related endothelial cells, with only four focusing in lymphatic endothelial cells (Table 6). Of these, two studies related to cervical 43 and oral squamous cell carcinoma 44 found a positive correlation between the development of EndMT in lymphatic endothelial cells and an increased frequency of lymph node metastases.Direct induction of EndMT during tumour progression and alterations in tumour biology caused by the EndMT process (Feedback Mechanisms)Table 6 illustrates that the majority of studies (n=42) reported the induction of EndMT by the tumour mass. For instance, one article showed that hepatocellular carcinoma cells induced EndMT in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) through the secretion of protein dickkopf-1, an antagonist of Wnt molecular pathway (dickkopf-1), which was characterized by increased migration, invasion, tube formation, and angiogenic capabilities 45. Conversely, a smaller number of publications (n=31) reported feedback effects on tumour progression arising from the triggering of EndMT process itself. One study indicated that EndMT enhanced tumour growth in mouse models of melanoma 46. Notably, some studies addressed both the direct induction of EndMT and its feedback effects (alterations in tumour biology, such as increased tumour growth, metastasis, or enhanced tumour-associated fibrosis, triggered by EndMT itself) simultaneously, for instance in some studies related to pancreatic cancer 47-49.We also observed a potential mechanistic relationship between EMT in tumour cells and EndMT in endothelial cells. Several articles suggested that malignant cells (e.g., oral squamous cell carcinoma, breast cancer, colon cancer) exhibiting EMT and higher invasive capacities 50-52 may be more effective at inducing EndMT in endothelial cells than epithelial-like cancerous cells. Furthermore, endothelial cells undergoing EndMT induced EMT in their surrounding tumour cells of oral squamous cell carcinoma 53 and breast cancer 54.Supporting this notion, a study on glioblastoma revealed that chemoresistant tumour cells, known for their ability to undergo EMT, were more effective at triggering EndMT compared to chemosensitive cells. The same work documented that endothelial cells (hCMEC line) undergoing EndMT also contributed to tumour chemoresistance 55. Interestingly, we found no articles addressing the potential of cancer-stem cells (CSCs) to induce EndMT, presenting an intriguing research opportunity given the established links between chemoresistance, EMT, and the CSC phenotype 56. However, we did identify two studies, focused on lung 57 and breast cancer 32, indicating that tumour spheroid structures, often associated with CSCs, induced EndMT more effectively than standard monolayer cultures, although the presence of CSCs within these 3D structures was not clearly defined. Equally, some authors noted that endothelial cells undergoing EndMT (with downregulation of CD31, VE-Cadherin, Tie1, Tie2 endothelial-like factors and induction of αSMA, fibronectin, TWIST1, SNAIL mesenchymal-like ones) could promote proliferation, invasion, migration, and stemness in colorectal cancer cells 58.Regarding the interactions between endothelial cells and other stromal cells within the TME, it is well documented that EndMT facilitates the transformation of endothelial cells into CAFs. For instance, invasive colon cancer cells have been proved to induce the transdifferentiation of endothelial cells (HMEC-1 line) into CAFs, with a more elongated morphology and increased migratory abilities, through the EndMT process 59. Despite this, we identified only a limited number of articles (n=4) focusing on the induction of EndMT by stromal cells. One study in cervical squamous cell carcinoma showed that the activation of the EndMT process by CAFs, through the secretion of PAI-1, enhanced the proliferation, migration, and permeability of endothelial cells. In fact, the cytokine PAI-1 binds to its receptor LRP1 on endothelial cells, thereby activating the ERK/AKT signaling axis, which enhances the proliferation, migration, and permeability of endothelial cells 43. Additionally, EndMT induction has been shown to trigger the recruitment, infiltration, and M2 polarization of macrophages 60. Correspondingly, Ji and colleagues demonstrated that TAMs, conditioned by ovarian cancer cells, promoted EndMT and enhanced tube formation of HUVECs 61. Similarly, another study found that mast cells activated by extracellular vesicles derived from non-small cell lung cancer cells could also induce EndMT along with the migration and tube formation capabilities of HUVECs 62. These limited, yet significant, findings underscore the need for further exploration of the interactions between endothelial cells undergoing EndMT and tumour-related stromal cells.Finally, we identified a limited number of studies (n=8) documenting the induction of EndMT by microenvironmental conditions closely linked to tumour biology. For instance, one study on breast cancer reported that 27-hydroxycholesterol activated the EndMT process in HMEC1 and HUVECs endothelial cells through their direct stimulation with the aforementioned molecule which promotes the activation/phosphorylation of STAT3 51, suggesting a potential connection between obesity and cancer development. Additionally, a study on pancreatic cancer, revealed that an acidic microenvironment, a well-known hallmark of solid tumours, promotes EndMT along with increased migration, invasion, and permeability of endothelial cells 63.Several studies have also shown that altered blood flow and fluid shear stress, frequently observed within the dense TME, may play a crucial role in triggering EndMT 64-66. Similarly, hypoxia condition, another hallmark of solid tumours, has been demonstrated to enhance the ability of TGFβ1 (a well-known inducer of EndMT) to trigger the EndMT process characterized by the downregulation of CD31 and VE-Cadherin 67. Furthermore, Smeda and colleagues found that advanced age increased the induction of EndMT triggered by tumour cells of breast cancer 68.Diabetes mellitus, a risk factor for cancer, is associated with elevated glucose levels. Notably, a study on colon cancer showed that high glucose levels promoted EndMT characterized by an upregulation of vimentin, SNAIL and αSMA 69.Figure 4 offers a graphical summary of the relationships between endothelial cells undergoing EndMT, tumour cells, stromal cells and tumour hallmarks.Experimental approaches in EndMT research: determining the molecular pathways involvedTable 7 shows a classification of the various experimental methods employed in the selected studies. The three primary approaches included in vitro studies, using cell line models (n=52), in vivo experiments with animal models (n=31), and analyses of human patient samples (n=18). One study that focused on hepatocellular carcinoma, examined EndMT using all three experimental approaches in conjunction 70. Furthermore, it is worth noting that the culture of 3D cellular structures allows for a more precise characterization of EndMT, as these structures better mimic the architecture and biology of living tissues compared to monolayer-based cell cultures. In this context, Kim et al. developed a microfluidic device that mimics the liver microenvironment to investigate the formation of the premetastatic niche influenced by extracellular vesicles from breast cancer cells, emphasizing the significance of EndMT in this process 71. Patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) have also been used to investigate EndMT. For instance, one study utilized PDX models of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma to define a reversible EndMT, which significantly enhanced tumour-associated desmoplasia 72.In our study, we investigated the types of endothelial cells utilized in the in vitro experiments designed to evaluate EndMT. These endothelial cell models are chosen for their relevance to specific organs or their ability to recapitulate key features of the TME.Our findings indicate that a range of endothelial cell lines were employed, as detailed in Table 8. The most frequently used cell line was human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), with 29 studies utilizing this model; however, a considerable number of articles (n=25) were based on alternative endothelial cell lines. For instance, human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) were employed to elucidate the role of EndMT, increasing vascular permeability, in the formation of brain metastases induced by non-small cell lung cancer cells 73. Similarly, induced pluripotent stem cell-derived brain microvascular endothelial cells (IBMECs) were utilized to investigate the mechanisms by which breast cancer cells traverse the blood-brain barrier via EndMT induction with an enhancement of endothelial barrier permeability 74. Additionally, human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC-L) were studied to further understand the induction of EndMT by non-small cell lung carcinoma cells, revealing a correlation between such molecular process and the development of metastases 75. Several studies utilized multiple endothelial cell lines concurrently, such as human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC1) and bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) in a research concerning pancreatic cancer 76. Furthermore, mouse endothelial cells, including primary rat brain endothelial cells (RBEC), were also employed to assess the impact of EndMT induced by melanoma and breast cancer cells on the permeability of endothelial monolayers, facilitating tumour cell transendothelial migration 25. Moreover, several studies isolated and directly analyzed tumour-associated endothelial cells (TECs) from mouse xenografted tumour tissues 77 and human patient tumour biopsies 78 to characterize the EndMT process. This variety of approaches underscores the importance of using multiple endothelial cell lines to gain a comprehensive understanding of EndMT in different tumour contexts.We further analyzed the methodologies used to investigate the molecular markers and functional properties of endothelial cells undergoing EndMT, focusing primarily on direct co-cultures of endothelial cells with tumour cells 79 and indirect cultures using conditioned medium from tumour cells 24. Notably, one study demonstrated that direct cell-cell contact between cancerous and endothelial cells may be essential for inducing EndMT, as conditioned medium from breast cancer cells alone did not initiate this phenotypic transition 80.Next, our review identified several experimental approaches for measuring specific molecular and functional characteristics of EndMT. Biomarker expression levels were predominantly assessed using quantitative PCR (qPCR), immunofluorescence detection, western blotting, and flow cytometry. Flow cytometry, in particular, proved to be effective for accurately detecting changes in various cell subpopulations based on the expression of specific markers (e.g., αSMA), even when other methods like qPCR or western blotting did not reveal significant alterations 81. Additionally, single-cell RNA sequencing was also employed to assess the heterogeneity of different cell subpopulations undergoing EndMT concerning their whole transcriptional profiles 79. Table 9 highlights the diverse endothelial-like factors that were downregulated during the EndMT process, alongside the mesenchymal-like factors that were upregulated, as identified in studies with multiple instances (n>1). This heterogeneity underscores the importance of incorporating a comprehensive array of biomarkers in the design of future research studies.Additionally, we observed a wide range of experimental assays assessing various functional properties altered during EndMT (Table 10). Notably, the results in this area showed considerable heterogeneity between different studies. As an example, some studies reported an enhanced proliferation capacity of endothelial cells during EndMT 82, while others indicated no changes 62 or even a reduction in proliferation rates 83. These discrepancies in biomarker expression and functional properties may stem from several factors, including the inherent heterogeneity of the EndMT process, differing microenvironmental conditions, variations in tumour and stromal cell types, distinct experimental setups, or the specific endothelial cell types under investigation.Finally, we identified several molecular factors that can induce EndMT, as summarized in Table 11. A substantial number of studies emphasized the role of TGFβ ligands (e.g., TGFβ1 and TGFβ2) secreted by own cancerous cells and/or stromal cells in triggering the EndMT process (n=25). Some publications utilized TGFβ1-induced EndMT as a positive control for comparing the EndMT initiated by other cell types, such as breast cancer or melanoma cells 84,85. However, it is important to note that TGFβ1 and TGFβ2 should not always be regarded as interchangeable in the context of EndMT induction. For instance, a study focusing on esophageal and colon cancer demonstrated that IL-1β and TGFβ2 (but not TGFβ1) could promote EndMT in human endothelial microvascular cells (HEMEC line) and human intestinal microvascular endothelial cells (HIMEC line) 36. Additionally, some studies reported that EndMT can be induced through the combined action of multiple factors, such as TGFβ2 and IL-1β within the melanoma context 81.The significant heterogeneity of the molecular pathways underlying EndMT in endothelial cells is summarized in Table 12. For example, in pancreatic cancer, the upregulation of L1CAM in tumour-associated endothelial cells (TECs) enhanced IL-6 expression, activating the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway, which in turn triggered EndMT associated with tumour progression and metastasis 86. Interestingly, Akatsu et al. identified several axes of heterogeneity, demonstrating that the TGFβ2/MRTF-A (myocardin-related transcription factor A)/SRF (serum response factor) axis drives a myofibroblast-like transition in endothelial cells (End-myoT), while the FGF2/ELK1 (ETS-like transcription factor 1)/SRF axis leads to a non-myofibroblast-like EndMT (End-N-myoT) 87. Specifically, this study showed that FGF2 antagonizes TGFβ2, promoting a non-myofibroblastic phenotype in endothelial cells through the activation of ELK1. This occurs because MRTF-A and ELK1 compete for binding to the same serum response factor. Moreover, partial or incomplete EndMT induced by breast cancer cells was characterized by the simultaneous expression of endothelial markers such as CD31 and VE-Cadherin, alongside mesenchymal markers including αSMA, FSP1, vimentin, and fibronectin 80. It is important to note that this study does not clarify the reasons behind the development of partial, rather than complete, EndMT. This could be attributed to various factors, such as short co-culture durations or the activation of specific molecular axes, as the expression of endothelial and mesenchymal markers may not be regulated by the same molecular factors or pathways. Some studies reported reversible EndMT requiring a constitutive induction by tumour cells 72, while others indicated an irreversible transition 24. This molecular heterogeneity is illustrated in Figure 5.Meta-analysis of EndMT-related biomarkers: exploring expression heterogeneity and correlations with patient prognosisWe conducted a meta-analysis on the expression levels of previously identified EndMT-related markers, focusing on both endothelial-like and mesenchymal-like markers. This analysis aimed to substantiate the expression heterogeneity of EndMT-related biomarkers across various tumours types, utilizing a larger sample size from the UALCAM database. We compared tumour tissues to their corresponding healthy tissues (Figure 6, Supplementary Table S1). Notably, we included three additional endothelial-like genes associated with cell-cell junctions, MCAM, CLDN11, and TJP2, that are known to be downregulated during the EndMT process. These additional markers were identified in only one article within our systematic review, reporting the downregulation of MCAM (CD146) in glioblastoma 24, CLDN11 (claudin 11) in colon cancer 82, and TJP2 in melanoma and breast cancer 25.Our findings revealed significant variability in expression levels, both within individual tumour types and across different solid tumours. For instance, in renal clear cell carcinoma endothelial-like genes such as ANGPT2 and VWF were notably upregulated, whereas OCLN levels were significantly decreased. Similarly, VWF and CD34 showed significant upregulation in hepatocellular carcinoma, contrasting with their downregulation in breast and lung adenocarcinomas. The mesenchymal-like gene VIM was found to be downregulated in bladder urothelial carcinoma but upregulated in renal clear cell carcinoma and glioblastoma. Consistent with previous studies 88, we observed significant upregulation of FAPα and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) across the majority of cancer types analyzed, highlighting their relevance in tumour biology, as they have been associated to tumour progression and/or metastasis.Given that mesenchymal-like factors can be influenced by both EndMT in endothelial cells and EMT in tumour cells, we concentrated on alterations in endothelial-like markers as more specific indicators of active EndMT process. Table 13 presents endothelial-like biomarkers that were downregulated with a fold change of less than -1.5 across various tumour types compared to healthy tissues, all exhibiting high statistical significance (p < 0.05). Note that we used a 1.5-fold cut-off, as it allowed us to focus on genes with statistically significant fold changes, in line with previous studies 89-91. The results suggest that EndMT may be more actively occurring in breast invasive carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, bladder urothelial carcinoma, and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma, as indicated by significant downregulation of numerous endothelial-like markers.We also analyzed correlations between the downregulation of these endothelial-like factors and patient prognosis using the KM/plotter database (Table 14, Figure 7). Notably, reduced expression of MCAM and CLDN11 in breast cancer correlated with poor overall survival and relapse-free survival. Furthermore, downregulation of PECAM1, VWF, CDH5, CLDN5, and CLDN11 was associated with poor overall survival and progression in lung cancer, which may emphasize a critical role of EndMT in these malignancies. Interestingly, our meta-analysis also indicated a trend of ANGPT2 upregulation across several cancer types, including colon, esophageal, glioblastoma, stomach, hepatocellular, and renal clear cell carcinomas, suggesting its involvement in tumour progression. We found correlations between increased ANGPT2 expression and poor overall survival, relapse-free survival, and first progression in breast, colon, and gastric cancers (Table 14, Figure 7).Additionally, in contrast to breast invasive carcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma, several mesenchymal-like markers were also downregulated in bladder urothelial carcinoma and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma apart from the previously mentioned downregulation of endothelial-like factors. This may suggest the predominance of a partial/incomplete EndMT or the possible upregulation of different mesenchymal-like genes during EndMT.DiscussionIn this study, we aimed to elucidate the current \"state of the art\" regarding EndMT in solid tumours while identifying potential weakness in the experimental evidence. Our analysis indicates that several cancer types, such as esophageal adenocarcinoma, ovarian, gastric, bladder, and prostate cancers, are under-researched in relation to EndMT. Notably, emerging data suggest a significant correlation between EndMT induction and the progression of diffuse gastric cancer, as underscored in an in silico study 92. This finding emphasizes the critical need for additional experiments-based research into EndMT in gastric cancer to fully understand its implications for tumour biology and treatment strategies. Prostate cancer, known for its significant fibrosis and strong association between CAFs and tumour progression, metastasis, and therapy resistance 93, also presents a compelling area for further research. Evaluating the contribution of EndMT to the fibrosis and progression of prostate cancer could provide valuable insights. Similarly, breast 94 and pancreatic cancers 95 are known for their fibrotic characteristics. Notably, distinct CAF subtypes with specific and sometimes contradictory roles in tumour progression have been identified even within the same malignancy, such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma 96. Investigating whether EndMT is associated with particular CAF subtypes and their roles in tumour biology merits deeper investigation.Additionally, we identified a limited number of studies addressing the induction of EndMT in lymphatic endothelial cells and their role in lymph node metastasis. This angle may be especially relevant in solid tumours characterized by significant lymphangiogenesis and lymph node metastases correlating with disease progression, as seen in bladder 97, gastric 98, and esophageal carcinomas 99 as representative examples. The presence of lymph node metastases arises as a postoperative predictive factor of cancer recurrence, poor overall survival and advanced tumour progression stage in many tumour types (i.e. pancreatic or colon cancer) 100,101. Interestingly, the loss of lymphatic endothelial barrier tight junctions/integrity and increasing lymphatic vessel permeability (potentially disturbed during EndMT) has commonly been considered as an event leading to lymph node metastasis, thereby facilitating tumour cell intravasation 102. Additionally, mesenchymal-like lymphatic endothelial cells contribute to extracellular matrix remodelling, creating a pro-metastatic niche within lymph nodes that supports tumour cell colonization 103. While our focus has been primarily on solid malignancies, it's important to acknowledge that EndMT has also been correlated with cancer progression in liquid malignancies, such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 104.The relevance of the functional interplay between endothelial cells undergoing EndMT and tumour or stromal cells has also been explored in this review. Most selected studies reported tumour cells as inducers of EndMT. However, the potential for CSCs to trigger EndMT in stromal TECs remains underexplored. This is particularly intriguing, as CSCs are thought to modify stromal cells more efficiently toward a pro-tumour phenotype (myofibroblast-like CAFs and M2-polarized TAMs) compared to non-stem cancer cells 105. We identified only one study that demonstrated that CAFs could induce EndMT 43. This finding is significant and highlights the need for a deeper understanding of the mechanisms by which CAFs influence endothelial cell behavior. Moreover, the parallels between endothelial cells undergoing EndMT and CAFs behavior suggests that these processes are not isolated but rather interconnected within the broader context of tumour biology. Indeed, CAFs have the capacity to \"educate\" other stromal cells like normal fibroblasts into a pro-inflammatory phenotype, which can exacerbate tumourigenesis 106. Our findings also suggest a positive correlation between EndMT and M2 polarization of TAMs, similar to the exposed ability of CAFs to promote M2 polarization, for instance, of glioma TAMs 107. Understanding how CAFs mediate these transitions, including EndMT process, may provide insights into potential strategies for targeting the tumour stroma to improve treatment outcomes.However, we did not identify any studies examining the influence of EndMT on the infiltration or cytotoxic activity of other types of immune cells, such as T or NK cells. This area is significant, considering that specific CAF subsets have been shown to restrict CD8+ T cell infiltration and tumour cytotoxic activity in head and neck carcinoma 108, and that CAFs can inhibit NK cells cytotoxicity by inducing ferroptosis in gastric cancer 109. Thus, further exploration of the cross-talk between EndMT and immune cells is warranted. Notably, a bioinformatic study indicated strong intercellular communication between CAFs with EndMT profiles and TAMs in breast, gastric, and colorectal cancers, correlating this interaction with poor prognosis according to TCGA data 110. Furthermore, several studies have established links between EndMT and common risk factors for cancer, such as obesity and high glucose levels, suggesting that EndMT could contribute not only to tumour progression but also to tumourigenesis.Our findings indicate a notable trend characterized by the downregulation of VE-Cadherin, an endothelial-specific marker, coupled with the upregulation of αSMA, a mesenchymal marker, and activation of the TGFβ pathway during EndMT. However, our analysis also revealed significant heterogeneity at both the molecular and functional levels across different studies. This variability can be attributed to a range of factors. One major contributor is the diversity of endothelial cell lines and types utilized in these investigations. Endothelial cells are not a homogeneous group; rather, they exhibit substantial differences depending on their anatomical location within the body. This inherent variability has been observed at the levels of cell morphology, functions, expression profiles, antigen composition and response to TGFβ2 111. Moreover, one study on melanoma revealed a subpopulation of TECs that possess antitumour properties, functioning through the L-PDGS/PGD2/DP1 (lipocalin-type prostaglandin)/PGD2/DP1 signaling axis. Specifically, this subset of endothelial cells can express the enzyme L-PGDS which catalyzes the formation of PGD2 (prostaglandin D2) that binds to its receptor DP1 inhibiting the EndMT process along with tumour growth 46. This discovery reinforces the significant phenotypic heterogeneity within endothelial cell populations, which mirrors the variability observed among different subtypes of CAFs found within the same TME.To obtain more precise and meaningful experimental results, it is crucial to utilize tissue-specific endothelial cell lines or directly isolate and analyze TECs from patient samples. The use of techniques such as immunomagnetic column-based isolation could effectively minimize contamination from CAFs and tumour cells, thereby enhancing the reliability of the data collected from isolated TECs 112. This targeted approach enables researchers to capture the unique characteristics and behaviors of TECs, fostering a deeper understanding of their roles within the TME and their potential as therapeutic targets.The characteristics of EndMT may also be heavily influenced by tumour types and specific cancer cell lines, reflecting variable molecular inductors and different molecular axes. While our data suggest a tendency to promote control EndMT in laboratory settings through TGFβ exposure, some studies have noted significant differences in the effects of TGFβ isoforms on EndMT induction, with TGFβ2 being the more effective isoform compared to TGFβ1 113. Furthermore, distinct responses to TGFβ2 exist between healthy endothelial cells and TECs from various tissues, tumour types, and even subclones within the same culture 114,115. When establishing in vitro models of EndMT, key considerations should include the type of endothelial cells used, the specific inducers applied, their dosage, exposure duration, potential interactions between inducers, and microenvironmental factors such as oxygen levels 116. Notably, exosomal TGFβ has been shown to induce EndMT more efficiently than soluble TGFβ, emphasizing the importance of EndMT induction methodology 64.In addition, the versatility of EndMT should not be underestimated. While much of the research has focused on the CAF-like variant of EndMT in cancer, it is essential to recognize the potential emergence of other mesenchymal-like cell types from this phenotypic transition. One candidate could be pericytes, which also play significant roles in fibrosis and myofibroblast expansion 117. Interestingly, one study identified two distinct variants of EndMT, including the End-N-myoT variant which does not lead to a myofibroblast-like phenotype in endothelial cells 87. Furthermore, the reversibility of the EndMT process could significantly influence tumour progression, analogous to the well-documented MET (mesenchymal-epithelial transition), which is critical for metastatic colonization 118. However, research on mesenchymal-to-endothelial transition (MEndT) in cancer remains limited. For example, only a few studies have suggested that CAFs in pancreatic cancer can transdifferentiate into endothelial cells via MEndT, contributing to tumour angiogenesis and tumour progression 119. Table 15 summarizes the key research gaps identified in this study.The plasticity inherent in EndMT positions it as a promising therapeutic target in cancer treatment. For instance, inhibiting the TGFβ pathway could simultaneously suppress EndMT and tumour progression. Similar strategies have been proposed, such as blocking TGFβ signaling and the traditional EMT process in glioblastoma-associated pericytes to disrupt tumour angiogenesis 120. Some studies have also identified an anti-cancer compound, like eribulin, that inhibits EndMT triggered by TGFβ stimulation and reduces tumour angiogenesis 121. Similarly, other publication showed that Nudifloside, a derivative of Callicarpa nudiflora used in China as a traditional folk medicine, can reverse the EndMT (through inhibiting Ezrin phosphorylation) induced by TGFβ1 122, thus revealing a potential anti-EndMT drug for cancer therapy. In this line, the EndMT process has also been implicated as a cellular response to standard anti-cancer radiotherapy regimens, potentially linked to tumour regrowth, therapy resistance, metastasis, and the emergence of CSCs 41.Despite the promising potential of therapies targeting EndMT, the significant heterogeneity of the EndMT process must be carefully considered when developing specific inhibitory drugs to avoid unintended consequences 123. For example, while TGFβ pathways may exhibit tumour-restrictive effects in early stages of cancer, they can promote tumour progression in advanced stages, complicating therapeutic strategies aimed at their blockade 124. Furthermore, anti-EndMT approaches could target tumour vasculature-specific biomarkers to minimize potential side effects in healthy tissues, as the EndMT process has also been observed in normal physiological processes, such as heart valve development 125. Thus, here it is reanimated the significant heterogeneity observed in the expression levels of EndMT-related markers. This variability is evident not only between different tumour types but also within individual malignancies, influenced by various factors and the simultaneous occurrence of multiple molecular processes. Consistent with findings in breast cancer, where the upregulation of endothelial-like genes such as VWF and CD34 correlates with increased angiogenesis, the downregulation of VE-Cadherin has been linked to EndMT 84. In this context, the careful selection of the appropriate EndMT-related biomarker(s) is critical for developing an effective anti-EndMT drug, rather than an anti-angiogenic one, which may be associated with frequent inefficiency and adverse effects in cancer therapy 126. Our review also indicates a markedly high activation of the EndMT process in lung adenocarcinoma. Notably, we establish, at the best of our knowledge, for the first time a statistical correlation between the downregulation of CLDN11 and poor prognosis in this cancer type. Interestingly, previous research has documented high CLDN11 expression in tumour cells from human lung squamous cell carcinoma 127, reinforcing the idea that the downregulation of CLDN11 identified in our analysis may predominantly arise from EndMT in endothelial cells. This underscores the complex interplay between endothelial plasticity and tumour biology, highlighting the need for further investigations into these relationships.Interestingly, our investigation highlighted ANGPT2 overexpression in several tumour types, particularly esophageal carcinoma, which may warrant future studies to evaluate its correlation with patient prognosis, given that ANGPT2 has previously been validated as a consistent biomarker in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma 1.Nevertheless, it is important to acknowledge some limitations in our systematic review. Specifically, a limited number of studies on certain tumour types (e.g., ovarian or nasopharyngeal carcinoma) were included, which prevents us from drawing robust, cancer-specific conclusions until further research is conducted. Regarding the meta-analysis, the expression levels of specific genes can be influenced by a variety of factors in clinical settings, in addition to the previously noted high heterogeneity of EndMT. For instance, the stage of tumour progression at the time of sample collection can significantly impact the interpretation of biomarker significance. Early-stage tumours may exhibit distinct molecular profiles compared to advanced-stage malignancies 128. Furthermore, individual genetic and epigenetic profiles play a crucial role in tumour biology and response to treatment. Variability in genetic mutations, polymorphisms, and epigenetic modifications among patients can lead to differences in expression profiles (including those related to EndMT) 129, complicating the establishment of universally applicable conclusions. These factors underscore the need for a more nuanced understanding of how molecular alterations operate in diverse patient populations.Additionally, specific anticancer regimens, doses, and administration formats can influence tumour cell expression profiles and their interactions with the surrounding stroma 130. Consequently, patients who have undergone prior treatments, such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapies, or immunotherapy, may exhibit changes in biomarker expression related to EndMT. These changes could potentially confound meta-analysis results and lead to inconsistencies across studies. Given these complexities, it is important to approach the statistical findings of this meta-analysis with caution. Only through rigorous experimental validation can we fully understand the role of EndMT-related biomarkers in cancer progression and their potential as therapeutic targets.ConclusionsThis study highlights the current understanding of EndMT in solid tumours, emphasizing the substantial areas where further research is needed, particularly in cancers such as esophageal adenocarcinoma, ovarian, gastric, bladder, and prostate cancer, and regarding the implication of EndMT in lymph node metastases.Our findings also indicate that EndMT could intricately be linked to CAFs and TAMs, suggesting a complex interplay between endothelial cells and TME components. Notably, the influence of CSCs on inducing EndMT in stromal endothelial cells remains underexplored, presenting a promising avenue for future research.Moreover, the variability in EndMT markers expression and phenotypic variations in endothelial cells across different tumour types and within the same tumour suggests that the process is influenced by a multitude of factors, including cancer type, endothelial cell type, microenvironmental conditions, and specific molecular inducers. This heterogeneity may complicate the development of targeted therapies aimed at inhibiting EndMT. The reversibility and plasticity of EndMT underscore its potential as a therapeutic target, especially through the modulation of pathways like TGFβ. However, the dual nature of TGFβ signaling across different cancer stages requires caution in therapeutic strategies. Understanding EndMT as a multistep process, rather than a simple biphasic transition, allows for the possibility of detecting partial or \"incomplete\" EndMT under specific conditions.Overall, our meta-analysis not only confirms the high variability in EndMT-related markers but also establishes a possible statistical correlation between EndMT and lung cancer, remarking the downregulation of CLDN11 and poor prognosis, alongside the upregulation of ANGPT2 with its possible role as a potential biomarker in esophageal carcinoma. These insights call for continued research to deepen our understanding of EndMT in cancer biology and its implications for treatment strategies.Supplementary MaterialSupplementary tables."}

The role of high-intensity exercise in HCM remains controversial due to concerns about potential adverse effects. This study aims to conduct a systematic review of experimental and observational studies to evaluate the effects of high-intensity training (HIT) on patients diagnosed with HCM. This systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items in the Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Guidelines 2020. A comprehensive search was performed using Proquest, Pubmed, Scopus, and JSTOR databases to identify relevant studies published up to March 2024. Both experimental and observational studies written in English were included in the study. No restrictions were placed on the year, country of publication, or duration of follow-up. Study quality was evaluated using the Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) tool. A narrative synthesis was also conducted to summarize the findings. A total of 1418 references were identified through the search strategy. After removing 151 duplicates, 1267 records were screened based on title and abstract, resulting in the exclusion of 1253 studies. The full text of 14 articles was assessed for eligibility, of which ten were excluded. Four papers with a total of 2008 sample sizes were included. Significant differences were observed in several echocardiographic parameters. HCM athletes exhibited higher left ventricular end-diastolic volume (96 ± 33 vs. 76 ± 27 mL; p = 0.001, effect size = 0.682) and stroke volume (58 ± 21 vs. 47 ± 17 mL; p = 0.004, effect size = 0.593) compared to non-athletes. Additionally, significant differences were found in left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradients: both resting (p < 0.001, effect size = − 0.192) and provoked (p < 0.001, effect size = − 0.258) LVOT gradients were significantly lower in the vigorous exercise group compared to the non-vigorous exercise group. In contrast, no significant differences were found between HIT and the comparator group in vital signs and functional aerobic capacity. Moreover, no significant differences were observed in arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, or mortality, suggesting that HIT did not increase the risk of arrhythmias or other adverse events compared to the comparator group. HIT improves cardiac function and exercise capacity in patients with HCM without increasing the risk of severe adverse events. These findings support reconsidering the guidelines on physical activity restrictions for individuals with HCM.", "body": "BackgroundHypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) often leads to impaired cardiac function and heightened susceptibility to life-threatening complications such as heart failure and sudden cardiac death [1, 2]. This condition represents a significant challenge in clinical management, necessitating a further understanding of its pathophysiology and optimal therapeutic strategies. One area of particular contention in managing HCM is the role of high-intensity exercise in individuals with this condition. Patients with HCM have traditionally been prohibited from engaging in vigorous physical activity, including competitive sports and high-intensity exercise [3]. This is possibly due to concerns regarding the potential exacerbation of cardiac symptoms and increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events.However, recent research has shed light on the complex interplay between exercise and cardiac health in individuals with HCM, prompting a reevaluation of existing guidelines and clinical practices. Previous meta-analysis studies showed that high-intensity interval training (HIIT) improves cardiorespiratory capacity in individuals with coronary artery disease, heart failure, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and obesity by nearly twice as much as maximal cardiopulmonary training [4]. In terms HCM, guidelines have been revised in the past decade due to improved quality evidence on the benefits and risks of exercise training. Recreational exercise with a mild to moderate intensity now has a Class I indication, while competitive sports and high-intensity exercise have a Class 2b [5].Another study showed that athletes with genetic heart problems could maintain their competitiveness with a relatively low frequency of cardiac events provided a thorough treatment plan is implemented, and a collaborative decision on potential risks is made [6]. Several studies on exercise training in HCM have been conducted previously; however, the conclusion regarding the safety and efficacy of high-intensity exercise in this population remains unclear. A randomized controlled trial showed that both high-intensity training (HIT) and moderate intensity training (MIT) increased fitness in HCM, although there were no differences between both groups [7]. In addition, another trial, which offers the largest assessment of exercise safety in HCM to date, recently showed no difference in rates of sudden cardiac arrest among individuals with HCM who report strenuous activity than those exercising moderately or sedentary [8]. In another cohort study of low-risk HCM athletes, choosing to continue participating in competitive sports voluntarily was not linked to a higher risk of major cardiac events or deterioration of clinical condition compared to reducing or stopping participating in sports and exercise programs [9].Although these findings are promising, most studies have been underpowered to demonstrate the safety of HIT in HCM patients due to the rarity of the adverse event [7]. This study aims to conduct a systematic review of experimental and observational studies to evaluate the effects of high-intensity exercise on patients diagnosed with HCM. Therefore, utilizing this approach has the potential to inform clinical decision-making, enhance patient counseling on high-intensity exercise safety, and ultimately contribute to improved health outcomes for patients with HCM.MethodsStudy designThis study was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020. The review protocol was registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) with ID: CRD42024561359. The search was carried out in March 2024 using four international databases: Proquest, PubMed, Scopus, and JSTOR. Search terms for relevant scientific studies were derived from medical subject headings (MeSH).Eligibility criteriaWe included studies that fulfilled the following eligibility requirements: (1) The studies must be peer-reviewed original articles in the English language; (2) the study design must be experimental (randomized controlled trial (RCT) or quasi-experimental studies) or observational studies (cohort, case–control, or cross-sectional); (3) participant are patient with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy according to Americal Heart Association (AHA) criteria [5], which received HIIT or its equivalent, including strenuous exercise or athletes training; (4) there is at least one of outcome studied, including cardiac function parameters (left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV), left ventricular diastolic diameter (LVDD), stroke volume (SV), or global longitudinal strain), performance of the cardiopulmonary organs (maximum oxygen uptake (VO2 max), heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), electrocardiography changes, or safety profiles (mortality or cardiac arrest)). We did not limit the date, geographic location of the studies, and certain characteristics of the participants, such as gender, age, and race.Study selectionThe results of the preliminary study search were screened. After removing duplicates by looking at the title and abstract, we classify these manuscripts as included or not included. Subsequently, the full text of each article included was assessed. Four reviewers assessed the entire study selection processes blindly and independently (CCC, LF, CIP, and VA). Any discrepancies across all reviews are resolved by discussion with the fifth reviewer (MNHRW).Quality assessmentThe Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) was utilized to evaluate the quality of studies included [10]. Six criteria are used: selection bias, study design, confounders, blinding, data collection techniques, and withdrawals or dropouts. There are two questions for each criterion—a total of 14—apart from the\"study design\"component, which contains four questions (if RCT). The rate (weak, moderate, and strong) represents the outcome of each criterion. The study's global rating (weak, moderate, and strong) is then determined by considering the rates of all six criteria. Four reviewers (CCC, LF, CIP, and VA) blindly and independently assess the quality of studies. Any discrepancies across all reviews are resolved by discussion with the fifth reviewer (MNHRW).Data extraction and analysisThe data analysis in this systematic review consisted of a qualitative approach. The data extracted were the author, year of publication, country, study design, sample size, intervention, comparison, and outcomes. Dichotomous data (frequencies and percentages) and continuous/numerical data (Mean ± SD) of each outcome were retrieved from included studies. Additionally, p-values for all variables were directly retrieved from the original study data. Effect sizes for continuous data were computed using Cohen’s h. For binary data, effect sizes were computed using odds ratio. Subsequently, a qualitative approach was performed by summarizing the findings of the included studies using a narrative synthesis technique. Four reviewers performed the entire process blindly and independently (CCC, LF, CIP, and VA). Any discrepancies across all reviews are resolved by discussion with the fifth reviewer (RW).ResultsStudy characteristicsThe study selection process of this review followed the PRISMA guidelines. Four databases (Proquest = 1176; Scopus = 131; PubMed = 78; JSTOR = 33) collected 1418 studies retrieved from these databases. Subsequently, 151 duplicated records were removed before the screening process. Based on the screening of titles and abstracts, we excluded 1253 records. We assessed the eligibility of the remaining 14 reports in full text. We excluded six studies due to irrelevant populations, three studies not specific to HCM, and one study that does not discuss HIIT as therapy. Last, the final selection included four articles in this review, as shown in Fig. 1. The study characteristics can be shown in Table 1. Subsequently, quality assessment results are described in Table 2.Fig. 1Identification of studies via databases and registerTable 1Descriptive characteristics of included studiesNo.AuthorsCountryStudy designTotal subjectsIntervention and comparison1Dejgaard et al.

(2023) [8]ModerateModerateWeakModerateModerateWeakWeakDefinition of high-intensity trainingHIT is broadly defined as vigorous exercise that requires a high level of exertion, typically measured by metabolic equivalents (METs) or heart rate thresholds. Dejgaard et al. [11] defined vigorous exercise as ≥ 6 METs, equivalent to jogging, rated using the Compendium of Physical Activities. Athletes were then defined as those with ≥ 4 h/week of vigorous exercise for ≥ 6 years, and competitive athletes were those participating in organized sports or competitions [11]. Lampert et al. [8] similarly defined HIT as activity ≥ 6 METs, performed consistently over time. MacNamara et al. [7] specified HIT as structured interval training at 90–95% of peak heart rate, involving repeated 4-min high-intensity bouts separated by 3-min recovery periods, conducted over 4 months following a month of moderate intensity preparation. Last, Pelliccia et al. [9] described HIT as regular athletic training lasting two or more hours per session, three times a week, with total weekly vigorous exercise ranging from 6 to 14 h, often involving participation in competitive sports.The comparator groups across these studies consistently engaged in lower intensity exercise, typically classified as moderate intensity or below. Dejgaard et al. [11] and Lampert et al. [8] described the comparator groups as non-athletes or individuals engaging only in leisure activities below 6 METs. MacNamara et al. [7] contrasted HIT with MIT, defined as continuous aerobic exercise below the maximal steady state without interval training. Pelliccia et al. [9] classified the comparator group as\"detrained\"individuals with HCM who had either ceased or significantly reduced vigorous exercise, engaging in less than 6 h of exercise per week. Across all studies, HIT involved higher exertion levels and structured protocols, while comparator groups were defined by lower intensity, non-competitive, or recreational physical activity.Effect and safety profile of high-intensity trainingNo significant differences were found between HIT and the comparator group in terms of vital signs and functional aerobic capacity. Specifically, SBP, DBP, HR max, and VO2 max did not show statistically significant changes (all p > 0.05), indicating that HIT did not significantly impact these outcomes compared to the comparator group. However, significant differences were observed in several echocardiographic parameters. HCM athletes had higher LVEDV (96 ± 33 vs. 76 ± 27 mL; p = 0.001, effect size = 0.682) and SV (58 ± 21 vs. 47 ± 17 mL; p = 0.004, effect size = 0.593) compared to non-athletes. Additionally, both resting (18.3 ± 22.3 vs. 23.0 ± 25.9; p < 0.001, effect size = − 0.192) and provoked (39.6 ± 42.0 vs. 51.1 ± 46.3; p < 0.001, effect size = − 0.258) LVOT gradients were significantly lower in the vigorous exercise group compared to the non-vigorous exercise group (Table 3). Last, no significant differences in arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, or mortality were found between the HIT and comparator groups (Table 4), with no difference in the incidence of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), sustained ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or syncope (all p > 0.05), suggesting that high-intensity training did not increase the risk of arrhythmias or other adverse events compared to the comparator group.Table 3Effect of high-intensity training on vital signs, aerobic capacity, and echocardiographic parametersCharacteristicOutcomeHigh-Intensity TrainingComparisonP-valueEffect size(Hedges [CI95%])SourceDefinitionMean ± SDNDefinitionMean ± SDNVital Sign and Functional Aerobic Capacity1SBP [mmHg]HIT171.43 ± 19.137MIT198.88 ± 34.880.077−0.958 [−2.029, 0.113][7]2DBP [mmHg]HIT86 ± 11.37MIT89 ± 19.0980.713−0.188 [−1.204, 0.829][7]3HR max [beats/min]HIT162.14 ± 13.817MIT163.25 ± 6.6180.849−0.105 [−1.120, 0.910][7]4VO2 max [mL/kg/min]HIT26.56 ± 8.677MIT24.89 ± 6.180.6770.226 [−0.792, 1.243][7]Echocardiography parameters5LVEF [%]HIT67 ± 77MIT62 ± 780.1910.714 [−0.332, 1.760][7]6LVEF [%]HCM athletes61 ± 644HCM non-athletes62 ± 7770.409−0.150 [−0.521, 0.221][11]7LVEF [%]HCM-trained65 ± 4.627HCM-trained65 ± 4.6611.0000.000 [−0.453, 0.453][9]8LVEDVHIT143 ± 387MIT140 ± 2180.8560.100 [−0.915, 1.115][7]9LVEDVHCM athletes96 ± 3344HCM non−athletes76 ± 27770.001*0.682 [0.302, 1.063][11]10LVDDHIT41 ± 77MIT47 ± 980.171−0.737 [−1.785, 0.311][7]11SVHIT97 ± 317MIT87 ± 1480.4460.427 [−0.599, 1.453][7]12SVHCM athletes58 ± 2144HCM non−athletes47 ± 17770.004*0.593 [0.215, 0.971][11]13LVOT resting gradientsVigorous exercise18.3 ± 22.3699Non-vigorous exercise23.0 ± 25.9961 < 0.001*−0.192 [−0.290, −0.095][8]14LVOT provoked gradientsVigorous exercise39.6 ± 42.0699Non-vigorous exercise51.1 ± 46.3961 < 0.001*−0.258 [−0.356, −0.160][8]15LVOT peak restingHIT12.89 ± 11.837MIT10.8 ± 8.4680.7040.206 [−0.811, 1.223][7]16LVOT peak valsavaHIT20.86 ± 17.537MIT19.06 ± 5.0580.7970.144 [−0.871, 1.160][7]17LVOT peak post-exercise gradientHIT52.87 ± 48.67MIT38.79 ± 39.6580.5530.320 [−0.701, 1.341][7]18Global longitudinal strainHIT−16.67 ± 3.837MIT−16.34 ± 4.2880.877−0.081 [−1.096, 0.934][7]19Global longitudinal strainHCM athletes−16.9 ± 3.344HCM non-athletes−16.4 ± 3.7770.445−0.140 [−0.511, 0.230][11]Table 4Safety profile of high-intensity training on arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and mortalityOutcomeOutcomeHigh-intensity trainingComparisonP-valueEffect size (OR [CI95%])SourceDefinitionEventTotalDefinitionEventTotalArrhythmiasNon-SVT (control period)HIT17MIT380.3260.28 [0.02, 3.58][7]Non-SVT (training period)HIT27MIT280.8761.20 [0.12, 11.87][7]Non-SVT (Post-training Period)HIT17MIT380.3260.28 [0.02, 3.58][7]SVT (control period)HIT07MIT180.7020.50 [0.01, 17.45][7]SVT (training period)HIT07MIT180.7020.50 [0.01, 17.45][7]SVT (post-training period)HIT17MIT180.9191.17 [0.06, 22.94][7]Sustained ventricular tachycardiaHIT07MIT08N/AN/A[7]Ventricular fibrillationHIT07MIT08N/AN/A[7]Frequent/polymorphic VEBsHCM-trained127HCM-detrained6610.3460.35 [0.04, 3.08][9]NSVT (24-h ECG)HCM-trained327HCM-detrained9610.6470.72 [0.18, 2.91][9]NSVTHCM athletes1044HCM non-athletes15770.6721.22 [0.49, 3.00][11]SyncopeHCM-trained427HCM-detrained5610.3511.95 [0.48, 7.91][9]Arrhythmic syncope (Non-ICD)Vigorous Exercise7699Non-vigorous Exercise89610.7201.21 [0.43, 3.34][8]Arrhythmic syncope (ICD)Vigorous Exercise15699Non-vigorous Exercise199610.8111.09 [0.55, 2.15][8]Appropriate ICD shockVigorous Exercise8699Non-vigorous Exercise119611.0001.00 [0.40, 2.50][8]Cardiac arrest and mortalityAborted sudden cardiac arrestHIT07MIT08N/AN/A[7]Cardiac arrestHCM athletes144HCM non-athletes2770.9120.87 [0.08, 9.90][11]Cardiac arrestVigorous Exercise4699Non-vigorous Exercise29610.2422.76 [0.50, 15.11][8]DeathVigorous Exercise4699Non-vigorous Exercise89610.5390.69 [0.21, 2.29][8]DiscussionIn this study, we evaluated the effect and safety of HIT in the HCM population. HCM is the most prevalent inherited heart disease, afflicting 1 in 500 individuals. It has been identified as a primary cause of sudden cardiac death in younger adults and athletes [12, 13]. HCM exhibits heterogeneity in both genotype and phenotype, with the defining feature being left ventricular hypertrophy without elevated afterload (such as arterial hypertension or aortic stenosis), diagnosed primarily through increased left ventricular wall thickness. Left ventricular hypertrophy arises from genetic abnormalities impacting cardiac sarcomeres, leading to pathological and frequently asymmetric thickening of the ventricular septum and/or left ventricular wall [14]. Currently, available guidelines recommend avoiding patients with HCM participating in competitive sports of moderate to strong intensity [5]. Sympathetic–vagal imbalance, microvascular ischemia, and energetic compromise, including metabolic acidosis, are all believed to increase the risk of sudden cardiac mortality during high-intensity training in patients with HCM [3, 15].In our study, we found that HIT did not lead to significant changes in vital signs compared to MIT. While some previous studies have shown improvements in VO2 max following HIT, our calculation of the effect size did not indicate a meaningful improvement. This discrepancy may be due to differences in the specific protocols used in our study versus previous research. It is possible that the lack of a significant finding here may stem from limitations such as sample size. Nevertheless, the importance of VO2 max as a key determinant of cardiovascular health and exercise capacity remains evident, and future research may provide further clarification on the role of HIT in improving aerobic capacity in HCM patients. The clinical relevance of the observed improvement in VO2 max with HIT is underscored by the fact that VO2 max is a critical determinant of overall cardiovascular health and exercise capacity [16]. Achieving higher VO2 max levels may result in improved functional outcomes for HCM patients, potentially improving quality of life. This improvement could be attributed to the peripheral adaptations triggered by HIT, which optimize oxygen delivery and utilization despite HCM-related limitations. However, further studies are needed to elucidate the peripheral adaptations to exercise training in patients with HCM [7].In HCM patients, the observed increase in LVEDV with HIT suggests a positive adaptation that may enhance diastolic function, which is frequently impaired in HCM [11, 17]. HIT can potentially alleviate symptoms such as dyspnea and fatigue by enabling the left ventricle to fill more effectively during diastole by enhancing LVEDV [18]. In turn, this could reduce filling pressures. This adaptation has the potential to increase stroke volume and overall cardiac output, as suggested by the Frank-Starling mechanism [19]. Consequently, exercise tolerance and VO2 max may be improved.The LVOT gradient is an essential indicator of obstructive physiology in HCM. It represents the pressure difference across the outflow tract caused by left ventricular hypertrophy and frequently exacerbates symptoms such as dyspnea and chest discomfort [20, 21]. Our study demonstrated that HIT and MIT had negligible impacts on the LVOT gradient, with neither training modality appreciably lowering peak resting or post-exercise LVOT gradients. Patients who exercised vigorously had somewhat lower LVOT gradients than those who did not, indicating that some level of structured, higher-intensity exercise can impact LVOT physiology without exacerbating blockage [7, 8]. This stability in the LVOT gradient with HIT, particularly in a population prone to dynamic obstruction, supports the idea that properly monitored high-intensity exercise can be safe for HCM patients.The primary concern of exercise prescription for individuals with HCM is safety because of the risk of life-threatening arrhythmias [22, 23]. This study demonstrated that HIT, in comparison with MIT, does not result in a higher incidence of arrhythmic events, cardiac arrest, or mortality in individuals with HCM. No notable difference in the incidence of NSVT, syncope, or adequate ICD shocks was detected between HIT and MIT, highlighting HIT's advantageous safety profile. The absence of notable variations in NSVT, ventricular ectopic beats, and other arrhythmias between HIT-trained and MIT-trained HCM patients supports the notion that carefully supervised HIT protocols can be properly executed without heightened risk [7–9, 11].Although the result of this study is promising, some limitations should be noted in this study. First, the small sample size and heterogeneity of the included studies may restrict the applicability of these findings to the larger HCM population. Variations in study designs, sample demographics, and training techniques between included studies may introduce bias, impacting the consistency of the results. Subsequently, the definition of HIT varied across the studies included in this analysis due to the limited data available from the definitions provided in these studies. This variation highlights the need for a more standardized approach to defining HIT in future research. More original research with consistent criteria based on intensity (e.g., METs or heart rate), structure (e.g., interval vs. continuous training), and the inclusion or exclusion of competitive sports would improve clarity and allow for better comparison of findings across studies.Additionally, the quality assessment analysis indicated that three out of four included studies were classified as having weak quality. Consequently, the interpretation of the results must be performed with caution. The possibility of methodological flaws in these studies highlights the necessity for additional high-quality research to enhance the evidence foundation. Furthermore, due to the absence of long-term follow-up in many studies, it is unclear whether HIT's beneficial benefits on aerobic capacity endure over time or whether continuous HIT affects heart structure and function differently in HCM patients. Future research might focus on larger, longer-term trials to establish HIT's efficacy and safety in a more diversified HCM population. Investigating the effects of HIT over time may reveal whether long-term HIT has any structural or functional impact on the myocardium in HCM.ConclusionsThis systematic review concluded that high-intensity exercise yields favorable outcomes for patients with HCM by significantly improving echocardiographic parameters, including LVEDV SV, and LVOT gradients both resting and provoked. Notably, these improvements in cardiac function did not come at the cost of increased risk for severe adverse events such as life-threatening arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, or death when compared to those who engaged in moderate exercise or maintained a sedentary lifestyle. These findings challenge the traditional cautionary stance on high-intensity exercise for HCM patients, suggesting that, under appropriate medical supervision, such exercise regimens can be safely incorporated to enhance cardiovascular health and overall fitness in this population. Consequently, our review supports reconsidering current guidelines on physical activity restrictions for individuals with HCM, advocating for a more nuanced approach that recognizes the potential benefits of high-intensity exercise."}

Evaluation of fibrosis by computed tomography extracellular volume (CT-ECV) may allow risk stratification for patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) scheduled for transaortic AVR (TAVR) or surgical AVR (SAVR). We performed a meta-analysis to determine the prognostic value of CT-ECV for the prediction of adverse events in patients with severe AS scheduled for AVR.Methods and resultsElectronic database searches of PubMed, Web of Science Core Collection, Cochrane advanced search, and EMBASE were performed. A comprehensive literature review was conducted to examine the association between CT-ECV and prognosis in patients with severe AS who underwent AVR. The diagnostic performance of CT-ECV for predicting composite adverse events (all-cause death and hospitalization for HF) was assessed using a pooled odds ratio (OR). Data from 902 patients with severe AS were extracted from six studies, including 881 TAVR and 21 SAVR cases. The pooled OR of abnormal CT-ECV for predicting adverse events was 4.53 [95% confidence interval (CI): 3.13–6.57 (I2 = 10%, P for heterogeneity = 0.50)]. We performed an OR meta-analysis on five studies with only TAVR cases (n = 807). The pooled OR of abnormal CT-ECV for predicting adverse events in TAVR patients was 4.85 [95% CI: 3.26–7.21 (I² = 0%, P < 0.001)].ConclusionConsidering the high prognostic ability and versatility of CT-ECV, it may be used to predict postoperative adverse events in patients with severe AS who underwent AVR.", "body": "IntroductionTranscatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) emerges as a novel therapeutic approach for patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS). Transcatheter aortic valve replacement indications have expanded significantly in the last 15 years,1–3 moving from only high-risk and inoperable patients to intermediate- and low-risk patients.4,5 Post-TAVR and post-surgical AVR (SAVR) patients have a residual risk of developing heart failure (HF) and cardiovascular death, even after successful valve replacement.6,7 While multiple factors contribute to the risk of residual HF, pre-existing myocardial fibrosis is presumed to be one of the important causes.8 Left ventricular (LV) fibrosis has also been linked to cardiovascular death, including arrhythmia-related mortality.9,10 Thus, assessing myocardial fibrosis is paramount in determining the appropriate treatment approach after AVR and predicting patient outcomes.Lately, computed tomography (CT) imaging has been utilized to evaluate extracellular volume (ECV), demonstrating reliability on par with cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)-derived ECV.11 Computed tomography ECV is particularly useful in detecting AS-related fibrosis because it only requires additional late iodine enhancement CT imaging, which is quick and can easily be incorporated into CT studies before the AVR procedure. Evaluation of pre-existing myocardial fibrosis in AS by CT-ECV may identify a high-risk population that may develop HF after AVR. Nonetheless, CT-ECV has not yet achieved widespread usage, and its effectiveness remains insufficiently studied.Consequently, we have conducted a meta-analysis of studies concerning the prognostic value of CT-ECV in patients with AS scheduled for AVR.MethodsSearch strategy and selection criteriaWe utilized the methods recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration and adhered to the reporting criteria outlined in the 2020 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis guideline.12 A database search was conducted using PubMed, Web of Science Core Collection, Cochrane advanced search, and EMBASE electronic database on 24 April 2024. The following keywords were used: computed tomography, CT, extracellular volume, ECV, CT-ECV, aortic stenosis, and AS (see Supplementary material online, Table S1). Eligibility criteria are all papers presenting CT-ECV values for AS that are searchable by keyword. Data extraction included both prospective and retrospective studies that contained CT-ECV data for AS. We excluded case reports, animal studies, and papers not in English as part of our exclusion criteria. We also excluded studies that included cases who underwent balloon aortic valvuloplasty without subsequent AVR, as balloon aortic valvuloplasty alone for severe AS patients is typically associated with poor prognosis.13,14 After screening all titles and abstracts from the search results, potentially relevant studies underwent full review for eligibility by two reviewers (J.K. and S.K.). A third reviewer resolved any discrepancies. Our study protocol was registered with the University Medical Information Network (registration number: UMIN000054148). Institutional review board approval was not required for this meta-analysis since it did not involve clinical patient information.Outcome measuresThe primary outcome of this meta-analysis was to determine the prognostic impact of CT-ECV in patients with severe AS who underwent AVR. To calculate the pooled odds ratio (OR), the number of normal and abnormal CT-ECV events was investigated. Adverse events were defined as hard endpoints: all-cause death and hospitalization for HF. Two reviewers extracted study characteristics, such as author name, publication year, country of origin, definition, patient disease, age, sex, and CT-ECV values.Assessment of the risk of biasWe used the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale and case-control studies to evaluate the risk of bias.15 To assess publication bias, funnel plots were presented for OR for the composite endpoint in AS patients.Statistical analysisA random-effects model meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.41 (Cochrane Collaboration, London, UK). The OR meta-analysis of AS was conducted using the general inverse variance method. To investigate the prognostic value of CT-ECV in the patients who underwent TAVR, we performed the OR meta-analysis in the five studies that included only TAVR patients.16–21 Only Suzuki et al.’s study included patients who underwent SAVR, and we could not assess the OR for the outcomes of TAVR and SAVR separately. To assess potential sources of heterogeneity, we performed subgroup analyses. First, we conducted an OR meta-analysis to compare the prognostic value of CT-ECV between single-energy CT19,21 and dual-source CT.16–19 Given that three of the six included studies were conducted in Japan, we also analysed studies conducted in Japan18,20,21 separately from those conducted in non-Japanese16,17,19 facilities to examine regional differences. Finally, considering the variability in follow-up durations among the studies, we divided them into two groups based on follow-up duration: those with longer follow-up periods (e.g. Suzuki et al. and Koike et al.)18,19 and those with shorter follow-up periods.16,17,20,21 Heterogeneity was indicated by I², with 0% showing no heterogeneity and 100% indicating substantial heterogeneity. The funnel plot was statistically evaluated using Begg's test. A P-value of <0.10 was considered statistically significant for Begg's test, while a P-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant for other statistical analyses.ResultsFinally, six eligible publications16–21 were selected from 19 candidate papers (Figure 1). Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the included studies. These six publications presented data on 902 patients. The number of cases for each AVR was 881 for TAVR and 21 for SAVR. The publication years ranged from 2020 to 2023. About the technology of the CT machine, two investigations used a single-energy CT,20,21 whereas four used a dual-source CT.16–19 In the study by Suzuki et al.,18 the cohort comprised candidates for AVR, with 74 undergoing TAVR and 21 receiving SAVR. Five of the remaining six studies focused solely on patients who underwent TAVR.16,17,19–21 One of these studies was exclusively dedicated to patients with low-flow, low-gradient AS.17Figure 1Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses flow diagram.

Overall, five of six studies (83%) were rated as high quality (scoring >80% on the quality scales), one of six studies (17%) was rated as moderate quality (scoring between 50% and 80% on the quality scales), and zero of six studies (0%) were rated as low quality (<50% score on the scales). The evaluation of the funnel plot of the OR for the composite endpoint in patients with AS was performed. The P-value for Begg’s test was 0.464, indicating that significant publication bias was undetected (see Supplementary material online, Figure S1).Association between computed tomography extracellular volume and composite adverse eventsAll studies defined the outcome as a composite adverse event. Supplementary material online, Table S3 summarizes definitions for adverse events, a follow-up period, and a cut-off value of CT-ECV for predicting adverse events. The cut-off values for CT-ECV were determined using the median in three studies,18–20 Youden index in two studies,16,21 and Liu index in one study.17 A composite adverse event was defined as the total number of all-cause deaths and hospitalizations for HF.16–21 Extracellular volume cut-off value in predicting adverse events ranged from 28% to 33%. A meta-analysis revealed that a higher CT-ECV was significantly associated with a higher composite adverse events rate [OR = 4.53 per unit increase; 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.13–6.57; P < 0.001; I2 = 10%; P for heterogeneity = 0.50] (Figure 2).Figure 2The pooled odds ratio of abnormal computed tomography extracellular volume for predicting composite adverse events (all-cause death and heart failure hospitalization). CI, confidence interval; ECV, extracellular volume.Four studies indicated the ORs of all-cause mortality and HF hospitalization separately.16,18–20 These data were used to create the pooled ORs of abnormal CT-ECV values to predict all-cause mortality and HF hospitalization separately. The pooled OR of abnormal CT-ECV for predicting all-cause mortality was 3.19 per unit increase (95% CI: 1.36–7.49; P = 0.008; I2 = 45%; P for heterogeneity = 0.15) (Figure 3). The pooled OR of abnormal CT-ECV for predicting hospitalization for HF was 3.60 per unit increase (95% CI: 1.98–6.54; P < 0.001; I2 = 0%; P for heterogeneity = 0.56).Figure 3The pooled odds ratio of abnormal computed tomography extracellular volume for predicting all-cause death and heart failure hospitalization. CI, confidence interval; ECV, extracellular volume.Prognostic value of computed tomography extracellular volume in patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacementIn the five studies, only patients who underwent TAVR were included (n = 807). We performed the OR meta-analysis to investigate the prognostic value of CT-ECV in these patients. A meta-analysis demonstrated that a higher CT-ECV was significantly associated with a higher composite adverse events rate (OR = 4.85 per unit increase; 95% CI: 3.26–7.21; P < 0.001; I2 = 0%; P for heterogeneity = 0.49) (Figure 4).Figure 4The pooled odds ratio of abnormal computed tomography extracellular volume for predicting composite adverse events (all-cause death and heart failure hospitalization) in patients with transcatheter aortic valve replacement. CI, confidence interval; ECV, extracellular volume.Prognostic value of computed tomography extracellular volume in relation to imaging technique, institutional location, and follow-up durationWe performed separate OR meta-analyses to evaluate the prognostic value of CT-ECV across different factors. First, we performed the OR meta-analysis that included single-energy CT20,21 and dual-source CT16–19 separately. A meta-analysis showed that a higher CT-ECV was significantly associated with a higher composite adverse events rate in single-energy CT (OR = 5.71 per unit increase; 95% CI: 1.99–16.38; P = 0.001; I2 = 25%; P for heterogeneity = 0.25) and in dual-source CT (OR = 4.34 per unit increase; 95% CI: 2.89–6.51; P < 0.001; I2 = 0%; P for heterogeneity = 0.44) (see Supplementary material online, Figure S2).Next, we analysed studies conducted in Japan18,20,21 separately from those conducted in non-Japanese16,17,19 institutions. A meta-analysis showed that a higher CT-ECV was significantly associated with a higher composite adverse events rate in Japanese institutions (OR = 4.25 per unit increase; 95% CI: 2.02–8.94; P < 0.001; I2 = 13%; P for heterogeneity = 0.32) and non-Japanese institutions (OR = 4.67 per unit increase; 95% CI: 3.01–7.26; P < 0.001; I2 = 0%; P for heterogeneity = 0.37) (see Supplementary material online, Figure S3).Finally, we assessed the difference in prognostic value between studies with longer18,19 and shorter follow-up periods.16,17,20,21 A meta-analysis showed that a higher CT-ECV was significantly associated with a higher composite adverse events rate in studies with longer follow-up periods (OR = 3.36 per unit increase; 95% CI: 2.01–5.62; P < 0.001; I2 = 25%; P for heterogeneity = 0.71) and in studies with shorter follow-up periods. (OR = 6.28 per unit increase; 95% CI: 3.67–10.75; P < 0.001; I2 = 0%; P for heterogeneity = 0.69) (see Supplementary material online, Figure S4).DiscussionOur investigation, involving 902 participants from six studies, represents the first comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of CT-ECV to assess its prognostic value in patients with severe AS scheduled for AVR. Computed tomography extracellular volume may serve as a valuable tool for preoperative CT planning by evaluating the risk of adverse events in these patients. Our analysis also demonstrated that CT-ECV was significantly associated with composite adverse events, even when limited to patients planned for TAVR. Additionally, the OR meta-analysis indicated that CT-ECV was significantly associated with composite outcomes in patients who underwent either single-energy or dual-source CT.Clinical significance of computed tomography extracellular volume assessmentComputed tomography extracellular volume offers a non-invasive and reliable method for assessing myocardial fibrosis and provides crucial prognostic information for patients undergoing AVR. While myocardial biopsy remains the definitive method for identifying myocardial fibrosis, its invasive nature presents challenges. Consequently, non-invasive imaging is expected to become increasingly crucial for evaluating fibrosis. Recent improvements in non-invasive imaging technologies, including CMR and CT, allow for quantitative myocardial fibrosis analysis.22 While CMR is typically employed for measuring ECV, using CT angiography to assess ECV offers multiple benefits for patients undergoing TAVR. Recent meta-analyses showed solid correlations between ECV measurements from CT angiography and those from CMR,22 and the quantification of CT-ECV has been validated by comparing it with histological evaluations of myocardial fibrosis.23 While CMR allows for its detection, logistically, it is rarely performed in the routine clinical care of patients with severe AS. In addition, CMR is not suitable for patients with paramagnetic metal implants or specific cardiac devices. In contrast, CT angiography is faster and generally more manageable for critically ill patients. Importantly, CT angiography is already a standard part of the pre-TAVR evaluation, aiding in the sizing of the aortic valve and the vascular assessments required around the procedure.24 Additionally, the measurement of mean CT-ECV was reported to have high intraobserver consistency,17,23–25 and adding CT-ECV protocol requires only an additional delayed CT scan, with minimal additional radiation exposure. Our current study showed that only 3–6 min of additional procedure time were required.16–21 Previously, renal dysfunction, atrial fibrillation, high Society of Thoracic Surgeons score, respiratory dysfunction, severe ventricular dysfunction, cardiac damage assessed by troponin, coronary artery disease, frailty, and age were known as the prognostic factors after TAVR.9,26,27 Computed tomography extracellular volume derived from routine CT scans adds useful prognostic information on these factors, appropriately stratifying the patients after TAVR. Therefore, incorporating CT-ECV could quickly become standard practice in pre-AVR evaluations.The mechanism of computed tomography extracellular volume in predicting outcomes for aortic valve replacement candidatesComputed tomography extracellular volume offers different meanings from the conventional severity of AS, as determined in transthoracic echocardiogram and CT. Five of six studies16–18,20,21 compared the aortic valve area and mean pressure gradient (PG) between high and low ECV groups. No differences in the aortic valve area were observed in any of the studies. In the study by Tamarappoo et al.,17 which focused on low-flow and low-gradient AS, the mean PG was significantly lower in patients with high ECV values (ECV > 33%: 25.2 ± 8.3 mmHg vs. ECV ≤ 33%: 28.8 ± 7.0 mmHg, P < 0.01). This could be partly explained by the lower LV ejection fraction (LVEF) in the high ECV group (44.9 ± 18.0% vs. 54.0 ± 17.6%, P < 0.01), indicating that a reduction in mean PG could be due to impaired systolic function in the high ECV group. The other four studies found no differences between CT-ECV and mean PG.16,18,20,21 Peak PG was compared between high and low ECV groups in three studies,17,18,20 but no differences were observed. These results suggest that CT-ECV could be a significant prognostic predictor regardless of conventional parameters of AS severity, including aortic valve area, mean PG, and peak PG.Higher CT-ECV is associated with poor prognosis in patients undergoing AVR for severe AS by reflecting greater myocardial fibrosis and myocardial damage.16,28 Increased myocardial fibrosis is associated with markers of myocardial injury and decompensation, such as elevated troponin T and pro-brain natriuretic peptide levels.16,29,30 The degree of myocardial damage, as indicated by higher ECV values, may be proportional to the degree of adverse LV remodelling and dysfunction.30 In fact, our meta-analysis demonstrated that CT-ECV is associated with LV systolic function, which is the prognostic factor of AVR candidates. In four of the five studies comparing patient backgrounds between the high ECV and low ECV groups,16–18,20,21 except for the study by Ishiyama et al., LVEF was lower in the high ECV group. Although there was no significant LVEF difference in the study by Ishiyama et al.,20 LVEF was numerically lower in the high ECV group. Additionally, Koike et al.19 showed a significant correlation between CT-ECV and LV global longitudinal strain, a more sensitive indicator of LV systolic function than LVEF. Thus, the poor prognosis in the high CT-ECV group is thought to reflect a decrease in LV systolic function due to advanced myocardial fibrosis and damage.Additionally, cardiac amyloidosis, which coexists with ∼16% of patients with severe AS, may also have a significant prognostic impact.31 Aortic stenosis with cardiac amyloidosis has a worse clinical presentation and a trend towards a worse prognosis.32,33 Our recent meta-analysis showed that CT-ECV had a high diagnostic accuracy for cardiac amyloidosis, with a sensitivity of 92.8% (95% CI: 86.7%–96.2%), specificity of 84.8% (95% CI: 68.6%–93.4%), and area under the summary receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.94 (95% CI: 0.88–1.00).22 This analysis indicates that elevated CT-ECV could also be caused by cardiac amyloidosis, which is a poor prognostic factor in patients with severe AS. Further investigation is needed to elucidate the mechanism by which high CT-ECV affects prognosis, and it may be necessary to consider early intervention in cases with high ECV values to improve prognosis. Importantly, since CT-ECV measurement is simple and can be routinely performed in cases considered for TAVR, it can potentially be a handy prognostic indicator in the current situation of a dramatic increase in AVR cases.Study limitationsFirst, the papers in the meta-analysis are characterized by relatively small sample sizes and mainly feature retrospective and case-control designs, leading to varied results. A wide range of 28–33% was observed for the cut-off value of ECV in predicting adverse events (see Supplementary material online, Table S3). Various factors could cause the heterogeneity of CT-ECV in severe AS. Patient-related factors include comorbidities like hypertension and diabetes that can influence ECV. Methodological differences also play a role; variations in CT scanner types, contrast doses, and imaging timing can affect CT-ECV measurements. Recognizing these factors is crucial for accurately interpreting CT-ECV in clinical practice. Second, the inclusion criteria varied significantly across the studies, leading to a non-negligible risk of selection bias. Third, the predominance of studies from Japan (three out of six) may limit the generalizability of our findings. However, it is notable that the association of CT-ECV with all-cause mortality and HF hospitalization was consistent across studies from both Japan and other countries (see Supplementary material online, Figure S3). This consistency suggests that the prognostic value of CT-ECV is applicable across diverse populations. Nevertheless, further research with larger, more diverse cohorts is needed to confirm these findings and enhance generalizability. Fourth, we should consider the influence of the length of the follow-up period on the observed differences in outcomes between the included studies. To investigate this, we performed a subgroup analysis comparing studies with longer follow-up periods with those with shorter follow-up periods. The results were consistent across both groups. Finally, we also need to address the emerging photon-counting CT technology, which enables precise material characterization and holds the potential for identifying specific causes of myocardial interstitial expansion.34,35 Although this technology is promising, its utility in patients with severe AS and its routine adoption in clinical practice remain uncertain. In contrast, the conventional evaluation of CT-ECV can be seamlessly incorporated into routine pre-TAVR CT scans, ensuring its clinical relevance and accessibility.ConclusionsThis study is the first comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of CT-ECV to assess its prognostic value in patients with severe AS scheduled for AVR. Considering its high prognostic, predictive ability and versatility, CT-ECV can be used for postoperative risk stratification in patients with severe AS.Supplementary Materialoeaf007_Supplementary_Data"}

IntroductionHypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a genetic cardiac disorder characterized by unexplained left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in the absence of other conditions that could cause such hypertrophy. It is the most common inherited cardiovascular disease, affecting approximately 1 in 500 individuals globally [1]. HCM is predominantly caused by mutations in genes encoding sarcomeric proteins, leading to myocyte hypertrophy, disarray, and fibrosis [2].The clinical presentation of HCM is highly variable, ranging from asymptomatic individuals to those experiencing severe symptoms such as exertional dyspnea, chest pain, syncope, and palpitations [3]. HCM is also a leading cause of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in young athletes and can result in progressive heart failure due to diastolic dysfunction, outflow tract obstruction, or arrhythmias [4].Historically, exercise recommendations for patients with HCM have been conservative. The potential for exercise-induced arrhythmias and SCD has led to strict guidelines, particularly concerning high-intensity and competitive sports. The 2020 American Heart Association (AHA) and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines reflect this conservative approach, advising that HCM patients avoid most competitive sports due to heightened risk [5]. However, as the field of cardiology increasingly embraces personalized medicine and digital health innovations [6], there is a growing opportunity to revisit these guidelines through a more nuanced, risk-based approach to exercise in HCM [7]. Recent studies suggest that a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach may be overly restrictive, potentially overlooking the therapeutic benefits of structured physical activity for select patient populations [8,9].Wearable technology and remote monitoring offer unprecedented ways to continuously assess HCM patients’ responses to exercise, allowing for individualized, dynamic adjustments that enhance safety while maximizing health benefits [10,11]. Emerging evidence suggests that tailored exercise programs may provide substantial benefits, including improved functional capacity, enhanced quality of life, and potential mitigation of disease progression [12].\nCentral Illustration: Personalized exercise programs and cardiomyopathy impact.Furthermore, structured exercise programs tailored to individual risk factors, such as HCM phenotype and arrhythmic risk, show promise in recent research [13]. Studies employing these personalized approaches, often involving digital health tools, have demonstrated the feasibility and safety of exercise in HCM [14].Despite these promising findings, a lack of comprehensive synthesis limits the translation of individual studies into clinical guidelines. There is a pressing need for systematic reviews and meta-analyses to consolidate existing evidence, guide clinical practice, and inform future research in optimizing exercise protocols for HCM patients [15]. This review aims to provide such synthesis, with the potential to support a paradigm shift from exercise restriction to personalized, supervised exercise protocols in HCM.2. Aim of studyIn this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aim to evaluate the impact of different types and intensities of exercise on clinical outcomes and quality of life in HCM patients. We will also assess the role of exercise in preventing disease progression and arrhythmias and determine the safety and efficacy of structured exercise programs tailored to individual risk profiles. This investigation will provide critical insights into optimizing exercise recommendations for HCM patients, balancing the benefits of physical activity with the need to minimize potential risks.3. Methods3.1. Study designThis systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the impact of exercise on clinical outcomes and quality of life in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Although not registered on PROSPERO due to timing, the review adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines to ensure methodological rigor and transparency [16].3.2. Search and inclusion criteriaA comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and cardiology journals, covering studies published up to May 2024. Keywords included “hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,” “exercise,” “quality of life,” and “sudden cardiac death,” among others. This strategy aimed to capture both traditional studies and recent research focused on personalized exercise approaches [17]. Inclusion criteria were studies involving HCM patients that evaluated the effects of exercise on clinical outcomes (e.g., arrhythmias, mortality, SCD, NYHA class) or quality of life, and detailed exercise protocols. Exclusion criteria included animal studies, case reports with fewer than 10 patients, and studies lacking sufficient data on protocols or outcomes.3.3. Data extraction and quality assessmentTwo reviewers independently screened studies and extracted data, including study characteristics, patient demographics, exercise protocols, and clinical outcomes. Discrepancies were resolved through consensus or consultation with a third reviewer. Outcomes assessed included arrhythmias, mortality, NYHA class, quality of life, and functional capacity.3.4. Statistical analysisMeta-analyses were conducted using random-effects models to pool effect sizes, accounting for heterogeneity. Sensitivity analyses and publication bias assessments were performed to ensure robustness of the findings.4. ResultsThis systematic review and meta-analysis included 12 studies investigating the effects of exercise on hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients (see Tables 1 and 2). These studies varied in design, encompassing randomized controlled trials (RCTs), prospective cohort studies, and observational studies, with a combined sample size of 1,200 patients (Fig. 1).The mean age of participants was 43 years, with a slight male predominance (56%). Both obstructive and non-obstructive HCM phenotypes were represented, and baseline characteristics such as arrhythmias, prior history of sudden cardiac arrest, and comorbidities were recorded.4.1. Exercise protocolsThe exercise interventions showed substantial variability in terms of type, intensity, and frequency:Aerobic Exercise: The majority of studies implemented moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (60–80% of maximal heart rate or heart rate reserve), incorporating activities like cycling, walking, and treadmill workouts.Resistance Training: A few studies included low-weight, high-repetition resistance training, aimed at enhancing muscular endurance without stressing the cardiovascular system.Combined Programs: Some studies used a combination of aerobic and resistance training to explore potential synergistic benefits.Most exercise sessions were conducted 3–5 times per week, with each session lasting between 30 and 60 min.4.2. Clinical outcomes4.2.1. ArrhythmiasIncidence of Ventricular Arrhythmias: The pooled analysis revealed no significant increase in the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias among HCM patients participating in exercise programs compared to controls (Relative Risk [RR] 0.95, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 0.75–1.20, p = 0.68).Atrial Arrhythmias: The incidence of atrial arrhythmias was also not significantly different between the exercise and control groups (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.85–1.42, p = 0.47).4.2.2. Sudden cardiac death (SCD)Incidence of SCD: None of the included studies reported cases of SCD during the follow-up period (Fig. 4). The overall pooled incidence rate of SCD was 0.00 events per 1000 patient-years (95% CI 0.00–0.05), suggesting a minimal risk associated with exercise in appropriately selected HCM patients.4.2.3. Heart failureNYHA Classification: Exercise intervention was associated with a significant improvement in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, with a mean difference of −0.5 (95% CI −0.7 to −0.3, p < 0.001). This indicates a reduction in heart failure symptom severity among exercise participants.4.2.4. MortalityOverall Mortality: The meta-analysis showed no significant difference in all-cause mortality between the exercise and control groups (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.60–1.20, p = 0.35).4.2.5. Quality of lifeQuality of life (QoL) was evaluated using the SF-36 and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ):Physical Functioning: The pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) for physical functioning scores favored the exercise group (+0.45, 95% CI 0.30–0.60, p < 0.001).Emotional Well-being: Exercise participants showed improved emotional well-being, with an SMD of +0.35 (95% CI 0.20–0.50, p < 0.001).Social Functioning: The SMD for social functioning was +0.40 (95% CI 0.25–0.55, p < 0.001), indicating enhanced social engagement and mental health benefits from exercise.4.2.6. Exercise capacityVO2 Max: The pooled mean difference in VO2 max was +3.5 mL/kg/min (95% CI 2.0–5.0, p < 0.001), signifying a meaningful improvement in exercise capacity among HCM patients who engaged in structured exercise (Fig. 2).4.3. Adverse events and subgroup analyses4.3.1. Adverse eventsThe overall incidence of adverse events was low across all studies. Minor adverse events, such as muscle soreness (reported in 15% of participants) and fatigue (12%), were observed but resolved spontaneously without medical intervention. No serious adverse events, including myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest, were reported.4.3.2. Subgroup analysesHCM Phenotype (Obstructive vs. Non-Obstructive): Both obstructive and non-obstructive phenotypes demonstrated comparable safety and efficacy with exercise interventions. No significant differences were found in arrhythmia or SCD rates between subgroups.Exercise Intensity (Low vs. Moderate): Moderate-intensity exercise yielded greater improvements in VO2 max (+3.5 mL/kg/min vs. +1.5 mL/kg/min) and quality of life compared to low-intensity exercise, while maintaining a similar safety profile.Age and Comorbidity Impact: Older patients (>60 years) and those with comorbidities (e.g., hypertension, diabetes) benefited from supervised moderate-intensity exercise. These groups exhibited significant improvements in functional capacity and quality of life, with a low incidence of adverse events.4.4. Statistical analysis4.4.1. HeterogeneityModerate heterogeneity was observed in the analyses of exercise capacity (I¬≤ = 50%) and quality of life outcomes (I¬≤ = 45%), likely due to variations in exercise protocols and participant demographics across studies.Low heterogeneity was observed in the analyses of arrhythmias and mortality (I¬≤ < 25%), indicating consistent findings across these outcomes.4.4.2. Publication biasFunnel plots and Egger’s test showed no significant publication bias for the primary outcomes (p > 0.10 for all outcomes), indicating robustness in the pooled results.4.4.3. Forest PlotForest plots demonstrated that effect sizes for exercise capacity and quality of life consistently favored the exercise group across studies (Fig. 3), with few outliers.5. DiscussionThe findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis underscore that moderate-intensity exercise is not only safe but also potentially advantageous for patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) (Table 3). These insights challenge the traditionally conservative exercise restrictions imposed on HCM patients, offering a transformative perspective on the role of physical activity in enhancing clinical outcomes. This discussion explores the underlying mechanisms that may contribute to these results, aligning them with current evidence to validate our conclusions and outline their broader implications.The reviewed studies reveal a low incidence of exercise-induced arrhythmias and an absence of sudden cardiac death (SCD), a reassuring outcome given the historical caution surrounding physical activity for HCM patients. Traditionally, individuals with HCM have been advised to avoid strenuous activity due to concerns over ventricular arrhythmias and SCD. Our meta-analysis, however, found no increase in ventricular arrhythmias (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.75–1.20, p = 0.68) and no instances of SCD, corroborating recent evidence suggesting that the risk of SCD during supervised, moderate-intensity exercise is minimal for HCM patients without high-risk characteristics [18,19].This outcome likely reflects careful participant selection and risk stratification, highlighting the role of individualized screening in promoting safe physical activity for HCM patients [20]. Most studies included only patients who had undergone comprehensive pre-exercise screening, excluding those with high-risk markers such as prior cardiac arrest, significant outflow obstruction, or arrhythmogenic substrate. This selection likely contributed to the low baseline risk observed, thus reinforcing the role of individualized screening and tailored exercise protocols in promoting safe physical activity for HCM patients.Significant improvements in exercise capacity, as evidenced by the pooled mean increase in VO2 max (+3.5 mL/kg/min, 95% CI 2.0–5.0, p < 0.001), suggest that moderate-intensity exercise can enhance cardiovascular fitness in HCM patients (Table 2). Improved exercise capacity is essential for daily functional performance and overall cardiovascular health, and several physiological mechanisms may explain this benefit:Cardiovascular Adaptation: Regular aerobic exercise leads to improved cardiac output and increased stroke volume, which reduces the heart rate at submaximal exertion and enhances overall cardiac efficiency [21,22].Muscular Adaptation: Exercise promotes skeletal muscle adaptations, including increased capillary density and mitochondrial biogenesis, which enhance oxygen utilization and improve endurance [23].Enhanced quality of life (QoL), particularly in physical, emotional, and social domains, was consistently observed across studies (SMD for physical functioning: +0.45, 95% CI 0.30–0.60, p < 0.001). These QoL improvements can be attributed to:Psychological Benefits: Exercise mitigates anxiety and depression, which are prevalent in HCM patients due to the disease’s chronicity and the psychological burden of potential complications [24,25].Social Engagement: Structured exercise programs promote social support, which positively impacts mental health and fosters QoL improvements [26].The observed reduction in NYHA class (−0.5, 95% CI −0.7 to −0.3, p < 0.001) suggests decreased heart failure symptoms among participants, likely due to:Enhanced Diastolic Function: Exercise may improve myocardial relaxation and reduce left ventricular stiffness, addressing diastolic dysfunction common in HCM [27,28].Peripheral Conditioning: Improved conditioning of peripheral muscles lowers metabolic demands during exertion, reducing symptoms like fatigue and breathlessness [29].The moderate intensity of the exercise protocols may play a key role in achieving these benefits without triggering adverse effects. High-intensity exertion can exacerbate arrhythmogenic risk in predisposed patients, whereas moderate exercise appears to offer cardiovascular advantages with reduced myocardial strain [30].Supervision of these exercise interventions by healthcare professionals provided a safety net, enabling immediate intervention if adverse effects arose and allowing for adjustment of exercise intensity according to patient tolerance [31,32].5.1. Clinical implications and future directionsThese findings support a more refined, individualized approach to exercise prescription in HCM management, potentially heralding a paradigm shift. Rather than broadly restricting physical activity, clinicians could consider promoting moderate-intensity exercise under professional supervision, as this may confer clinical and psychosocial benefits [33]. This strategy should include:Personalized Risk Stratification: Detailed patient evaluation to identify those who can safely engage in moderate exercise [34].Structured and Supervised Exercise Programs: Designing monitored exercise interventions to safeguard patient safety [35].Patient Education: Informing patients about the benefits of exercise and safe practices to dispel fears and encourage adherence.5.2. Study limitationsThis study’s generalizability is limited by the exclusion of high-risk HCM patients and the focus on low-to-moderate intensity exercise. The heterogeneity of included studies and short follow-up periods further restrict the applicability of these findings to real-world settings. High-intensity exercise remains underexplored in this population, highlighting the need for future research in this area.In future, further studies should assess the long-term impact of moderate exercise on clinical outcomes and survival in HCM patients, with particular focus on exploring molecular and hemodynamic mechanisms underpinning the observed benefits. These insights would further refine exercise recommendations, ensuring evidence-based guidance for optimizing quality of life and functional capacity in HCM care.6. ConclusionThis systematic review and meta-analysis provide robust evidence that moderate-intensity exercise is both safe and advantageous for patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). These findings advocate for the integration of personalized, structured exercise programs into routine clinical practice, emphasizing the importance of further research to refine exercise prescriptions and enhance patient outcomes. Encouraging safe, supervised physical activity marks a progressive step in the comprehensive management of HCM, effectively balancing the therapeutic benefits of exercise with the imperative to mitigate risks."}
{"PMCID": "12057526", "title": "Comparative Efficacy of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Versus High-Flow Nasal Cannula Therapy in Children With Acute Bronchiolitis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis", "abstract": "This systematic review and meta-analysis compared the efficacy of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) therapy in children with acute bronchiolitis. A comprehensive literature search across multiple electronic databases identified six randomized controlled trials for inclusion. The primary outcomes assessed were treatment failure, the need for invasive mechanical ventilation, and length of hospital stay. Pooled analysis revealed no significant difference between CPAP and HFNC in the risk of requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (RR 0.94, 95% CI: 0.60-1.46) with minimal heterogeneity across studies. Treatment failure was higher in the HFNC group than in CPAP, but this difference was not statistically significant (RR 1.20, 95% CI: 0.63-2.27), though heterogeneity was substantial (I²=70%). Sensitivity analysis after removing one study showed a significantly higher risk of treatment failure with HFNC (RR 1.67, 95% CI: 1.07-2.61) with reduced heterogeneity. Length of hospital stay was comparable between both interventions (MD 0.57, 95% CI: -0.16-1.31). Both respiratory support strategies effectively reduce respiratory effort in moderate to severe bronchiolitis through different mechanisms, such as CPAP, which provides consistent positive end-expiratory pressure, and HFNC through enhanced minute ventilation and nasopharyngeal dead space reduction. Despite some limitations, including small sample sizes and inability to conduct subgroup analyses due to lack of individual patient data, this meta-analysis suggests HFNC may serve as a viable alternative to CPAP, particularly in resource-limited settings, showing comparable outcomes for critical endpoints while potentially offering practical advantages in administration and patient comfort.", "body": "Introduction and backgroundThe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the main cause of acute bronchiolitis, the most prevalent lower respiratory tract illness in newborns and young children [1]. It is a leading cause of hospital admissions in children under two years of age, often presenting with symptoms of cough, wheezing, tachypnea, and respiratory distress [2]. While most cases are mild and self-limiting, a subset of infants develops severe respiratory distress requiring respiratory support [3]. The optimal non-invasive respiratory support strategy for acute bronchiolitis remains a subject of ongoing debate, particularly between high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) therapy and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) [4]. HFNC has gained widespread use in recent years due to its ease of administration, patient comfort, and ability to deliver heated, humidified oxygen at high flow rates, generating a degree of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) [5,6]. It has been shown to improve oxygenation and reduce the work of breathing by providing flow-dependent airway distension and dead space washout [7]. Despite these advantages, concerns remain regarding its effectiveness in preventing escalation to more invasive respiratory support compared to CPAP.CPAP, on the other hand, has been used for decades in pediatric respiratory failure and is recognized for its ability to provide consistent PEEP, reduce atelectasis, and improve functional residual capacity [8]. By maintaining airway patency and reducing inspiratory effort, CPAP may offer superior respiratory support in children with moderate to severe bronchiolitis [9]. However, CPAP is often associated with greater patient discomfort, the need for sedation in some cases, and a higher level of nursing and medical supervision compared to HFNC [10]. Recent studies have attempted to compare the efficacy and safety of CPAP and HFNC in managing acute bronchiolitis, but results have been inconsistent. While some studies suggest that HFNC is non-inferior to CPAP in preventing treatment failure and reducing intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, others report superior outcomes with CPAP in reducing respiratory distress and avoiding intubation [11-14]. Given the clinical and practical implications of selecting the optimal respiratory support strategy in children with acute bronchiolitis, this systematic review and meta-analysis aim to synthesize the available evidence comparing CPAP and HFNC in terms of efficacy outcomes. By analyzing treatment failure rates, the need for intubation, and the length of hospital stay, our study will provide valuable insights to guide clinical decision-making and optimize respiratory management strategies for children with acute bronchiolitis.ReviewMethodology Literature Search and Search Strategy A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify relevant studies comparing CPAP and HFNC in children with acute bronchiolitis. The search was performed across multiple electronic databases, including MedLine (PubMed), Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Scopus. The search strategy employed a systematic approach to identify relevant studies comparing CPAP and HFNC in pediatric bronchiolitis. Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms, including \"Bronchiolitis,\" \"Bronchiolitis, Viral,\" \"Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections,\" \"Continuous Positive Airway Pressure,\" \"Positive-Pressure Respiration,\" \"Cannula,\" and \"Oxygen Inhalation Therapy\" were combined with free-text keywords such as \"bronchiolitis,\" \"respiratory syncytial virus,\" \"RSV,\" \"CPAP,\" \"continuous positive airway pressure,\" \"high flow nasal cannula,\" \"HFNC,\" \"high-flow oxygen therapy,\" and \"nasal oxygen.\" Population terms like \"infant,\" \"child,\" \"pediatric,\" and \"paediatric\" were incorporated to focus on the relevant age group. Boolean operators (AND, OR) connected these terms to capture all potential studies examining these interventions. The search was further refined by applying filters for randomized controlled trials and using terms like \"randomized,\" \"randomised,\" \"controlled trial,\" and \"comparative effectiveness research.\" No language restrictions were applied, and the search was limited to studies published up to 25 January 2025. Reference lists of included articles and relevant review papers were also manually screened to identify additional eligible studies. The search was performed by two authors independently. Disagreement that occurred during the process of the literature search was resolved through consensus, and the principal investigator was involved in the discussion if required.Study Selection Studies were included if they met the following criteria: infants and children diagnosed with acute bronchiolitis; studies comparing CPAP and HFNC; reporting of at least one of the following clinical outcomes-treatment failure, need for intubation, length of hospital stay, or adverse events; and study design limited to randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Studies involving patients with significant comorbidities unrelated to bronchiolitis were excluded. Case reports, observational studies, conference abstracts without sufficient data, and editorials were also excluded from this study. Following a screening of all identified studies' titles and abstracts by two independent reviewers, full-text papers of possibly suitable studies were obtained for additional evaluation. Predetermined eligibility criteria were used to decide the final inclusion. A third reviewer was consulted or discussed with in order to settle any disputes between the reviewers. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram was used to record the study selection procedure [15].Data Extraction and Quality Assessment Data from the included studies were extracted using a pre-designed data extraction form on Microsoft Excel (Redmond, USA). Extracted information included study characteristics (author, year of publication, country, study design, and sample size) and reported outcomes (treatment failure, intubation rate, length of hospital stays, and adverse events). The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias (RoB) tool [16]. Two independent reviewers conducted the data extraction and performed the quality assessment, and any discrepancies were resolved by consensus.For evidence quality assessment, we implemented the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) methodology. GRADEPro GDT was used to perform the GRADE assessment (McMaster University and Evidence Prime, 2025) [17].Data Analysis RevMan Version 5.4.1 was used for the data analysis. We computed the risk ratio (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) for categorical outcomes, such as the risk of invasive mechanical ventilation and treatment failure. We presented the mean difference (MD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) for continuous outcomes, including the duration of hospitalization. P-values below 0.05 were regarded as statistically significant. Cochran's Q test and the I² statistic were used to evaluate heterogeneity. Low heterogeneity was indicated by an I² value of 25% or less, moderate heterogeneity by values between 25% and 50%, and high heterogeneity by values more than 50%. We performed a sensitivity analysis to assess the influence of specific studies on the overall findings to investigate potential causes of heterogeneity. Results Through online database searching, we found 158 records. After removing duplicates, the initial screening of 85 records was done by two authors. Detailed assessment was done after obtaining the full text of 12 articles. Finally, six articles were included in this meta-analysis. Figure 1 shows the study selection process. Table 1 presents the characteristics of the included studies. Figure 2 presents a quality assessment of all included studies. Figure 3 presents a GRADE assessment of all included studies. Our evidence synthesis indicates that while there is high certainty that treatment failure rates between HFNC and CPAP may differ (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.63-2.27), the confidence interval spans both benefit and harm. For invasive mechanical ventilation, low-certainty evidence suggests comparable effectiveness (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.60-1.46), while high-certainty evidence indicates a non-significant trend toward slightly longer hospital stays with HFNC. These findings highlight the importance of considering both the point estimates and their uncertainty when selecting respiratory support modalities.Figure 1PRISMA flowchart (study selection process)Table 1Characteristics of included studies CPAP: Continuous Positive Airway Pressure HFNC: High-Flow Nasal Cannula\nAuthor\n\nYear\n\nSetting\n\nRegion\n\nGroups\n\nSample Size\n\nAge (in Months)\n\nBorgi et al. [12]\n\n2021\n\nSingle center\n\nTunisia\n\nHFNC\n\n130\n\n1.78\n\nCPAP\n\n125\n\n1.62\n\nCesar et al. [13]\n\n2020\n\nSingle center\n\nBrazil\n\nHFNC\n\n35\n\n3.37\n\nCPAP\n\n28\n\n2.43\n\nMaya et al. [11]\n\n2024\n\nSingle center\n\nIndia\n\nHFNC\n\n59\n\n7\n\nCPAP\n\n59\n\n4\n\nMilesi et al. [18]\n\n2017\n\nMulti-center\n\nFrance\n\nHFNC\n\n71\n\n1.4\n\nCPAP\n\n71\n\n1.27\n\nSarkar et al. [14]\n\n2018\n\nSingle center\n\nIndia\n\nHFNC\n\n15\n\n4.06\n\nCPAP\n\n16\n\n2.81\n\nVahlkvist et al. [19]\n\n2020\n\nSingle center\n\nDenmark\n\nHFNC\n\n22\n\n2.1\n\nCPAP\n\n28\n\n2.8\nFigure 2Quality assessment of included studiesFigure 3GRADE summary of findings table with all the outcomesMeta-analysis of outcomes Invasive Mechanical Ventilation Six studies were included in the pooled analysis comparing the risk of invasive mechanical ventilation between children in the CPAP and HFNC groups, and the results of the pooled analysis are shown in Figure 4. Pooled analysis indicated that the risk of mechanical ventilation was not significantly different between the two groups (0.94, 95% CI: 0.60 to 1.46). No significant heterogeneity was reported among the study results (I-square: 0%, p-value: 0.46). Figure 4Comparing risk of invasive ventilation between two groupsReferences [11-14,18-19]Treatment Failure Six studies were included in the pooled analysis comparing the risk of treatment failure between children in the CPAP and HFNC groups, and the results of the pooled analysis are shown in Figure 5. Pooled analysis showed that the risk of treatment failure was higher in the HFNC group compared to the CPAP group, but the difference was statistically insignificant (1.20, 95% CI: 0.63 to 2.27). Significant heterogeneity was reported among the study results (I-square: 70%, p-value: 0.005).Figure 5Comparison of treatment failure between two groupsReferences [11-14,18-19]Length of Hospital Stay in Days Three studies were included in the pooled analysis comparing the length of hospital stay between children in the CPAP and HFNC groups, and the results of the pooled analysis are shown in Figure 6. As shown in Figure 4, the length of hospital stay was not different between the two groups (MD: 0.57, 95% CI: -0.16 to 1.31). High heterogeneity was reported among the study results (I-square: 71%, p-value: 0.03).Figure 6Comparison of length of hospital stay between two groupsReferences [11-13]Sensitivity analysisTwo of the three outcomes assessed in this study, treatment failure and length of hospital stay, showed significant heterogeneity. We performed sensitivity analysis by removing the study conducted by Maya et al. [11]. Although the risk of treatment failure remained higher in children in the HFNC group, the difference became statistically significant (RR: 1.67, 95% CI: 1.07 to 2.61). Heterogeneity decreased substantially from 70% to 28%. Similarly, when computing the effect estimate of the length of hospital stay without the Maya et al. study [11], although hospital stays remained longer in the HFNC group (MD: 0.22, 95% CI: -0.48 to 0.91), heterogeneity decreased markedly from 71% to 27%.The Maya et al. study [11] included a notably broader age range (1-23 months, median age seven months in the HFNC group) compared to other studies that primarily enrolled younger infants (median ages 1.4-4.1 months). This age difference is clinically significant, as bronchiolitis pathophysiology and airway mechanics vary substantially between young infants and older children. Younger infants typically have smaller airways with higher resistance and greater susceptibility to mucosal edema, potentially responding differently to pressure-based therapies like b-CPAP versus flow-based therapies like HFNC. This age heterogeneity likely explains Maya's divergent findings favoring HFNC, as older infants might benefit more from HFNC's flow-dependent mechanisms than from the constant pressure provided by CPAP.Discussion This meta-analysis included six RCTs comparing outcomes between CPAP and HFNC, assessing the risk of therapeutic failure and the need for invasive mechanical ventilation. The findings indicated no significant difference between the two groups in terms of treatment failure rates. However, considerable heterogeneity was observed across studies, requiring careful assessment of both clinical and statistical factors influencing these outcomes.Sources of HeterogeneityOur comprehensive assessment of heterogeneity revealed multiple contributing factors. Statistically, the I² values were substantial for treatment failure (70%) and length of hospital stay (71%), suggesting important variability in effect estimates across studies. Through systematic evaluation of forest plots and influence analyses, we identified that the Maya et al. study [11] significantly contributed to this heterogeneity. When excluded in sensitivity analyses, heterogeneity decreased markedly (I² reduced to 28% for treatment failure and 27% for length of stay).Clinically, several factors likely contributed to between-study variability. First, substantial differences in patient populations existed, with Maya et al. [11] including older infants (median age seven months) compared to other studies (median ages 1.4-4.1 months). Second, the studies employed different CPAP delivery methods: Maya utilized bubble CPAP while others used ventilator-driven CPAP systems. Third, treatment failure definitions varied considerably across studies, from objective criteria like specific changes in respiratory rate to more subjective clinical assessments. Fourth, healthcare settings differed substantially, with studies conducted in varied resource contexts that may have influenced overall care approaches [20].Contextualizing FindingsThese results contrast with previous studies, including a systematic review and meta-analysis of five RCTs conducted up to June 2022, which focused on children under two years with moderate to severe bronchiolitis and reported different conclusions [21]. Our review incorporated a more recent RCT comparing HFNC and CPAP, which was the only study to report a significantly lower treatment failure rate in the HFNC group compared to CPAP. Additionally, we found no significant difference in the length of hospital stay between the two interventions. However, Maya et al. [11] reported a longer hospital stay for patients in the HFNC group compared to CPAP. HFNC has been compared in numerous trials with other respiratory support techniques, such as B-CPAP, CPAP, nasal positive pressure ventilation, and normal oxygen therapy. These studies evaluated the severity of respiratory diseases in various pediatric care settings and reported a variety of results [22-26]. For instance, an RCT conducted between 2012 and 2015 evaluated high-flow warm humidified oxygen against standard nasal cannula oxygen in children under 24 months with moderate bronchiolitis [22]. The findings indicated that treatment failure was less common in the HFNC group compared to standard oxygen therapy. However, HFNC did not lead to a shorter duration of oxygen therapy in the emergency department.Challenges in Outcome AssessmentInterpreting treatment failure requires careful consideration, as its definition varies across studies. In the Cesar et al. (2020) study [13], treatment failure was defined as the need for escalation to bilevel noninvasive ventilation or endotracheal intubation. Moreover, determining treatment failure often involves a degree of subjectivity, as it is not solely based on objective ventilatory parameters. This heterogeneity in outcome definitions represents a significant methodological challenge when comparing efficacy across studies.A more reliable way to validate outcomes like treatment failure may be to examine their correlation with objective measures such as intubation rates or mortality. In this analysis, CPAP did not demonstrate a lower risk of mortality or mechanical ventilation. The inherent subjectivity in defining treatment failure across studies may have introduced bias, making it a less dependable measure for evaluating the effectiveness of these respiratory support strategies.Physiological MechanismsGiven the pathophysiology of respiratory failure in bronchiolitis, both CPAP and HFNC serve as effective interventions to reduce respiratory effort in patients with moderate to severe lung disease. This, in turn, helps lower the need for invasive ventilatory support and its associated complications [26,27]. The proposed mechanism of action of CPAP is based on the concept that positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) enhances residual functional capacity and lung volume, preventing alveolar collapse. Additionally, it widens the airways, thereby reducing lower airway resistance and preventing obstructive apnea, which is particularly beneficial for patients with bronchiolitis [26]. For HFNC, delivering heated and humidified gas at a high flow enhances minute ventilation and reduces dead space in the nasopharynx, thereby decreasing respiratory effort. This process also facilitates secretion clearance while preventing bronchial obstruction and inflammation caused by exposure to dry, cold air. Additionally, HFNC is believed to generate a certain level of PEEP, although it is less than that provided by CPAP and cannot be precisely measured [28].Clinical ImplicationsBased on the findings of our meta-analysis and careful consideration of between-study heterogeneity, there were no significant differences in mortality or the need for mechanical ventilation between HFNC and CPAP in children with severe bronchiolitis. HFNC was associated with a lower risk of adverse events, which may make it a potentially favorable option in certain clinical contexts [29]. The substantial heterogeneity observed suggests that patient-specific factors, healthcare setting characteristics, and implementation approaches may significantly influence comparative effectiveness.While both interventions have been effective in reducing intubation rates in previous studies, our analysis reinforces the need for further high-quality clinical trials with standardized outcome definitions to confirm these outcomes, particularly in diverse clinical settings, including resource-limited environments. Future research should emphasize age-stratified analyses and clearly defined, objective outcome measures to better clarify which patient populations might derive greater benefit from each intervention.Study limitationsThis meta-analysis has several limitations that should be acknowledged. First, the overall sample size across the included studies is relatively small, which may limit the statistical power and generalizability of the findings. Additionally, the number of studies available for inclusion is limited, restricting the robustness of the conclusions drawn. Second, the lack of access to individual patient-level data prevented us from conducting subgroup analyses. As a result, we were unable to assess whether the efficacy of different interventions varied across specific patient subgroups, such as those with differing disease severity, age groups, or comorbidities. Subgroup analyses could have provided valuable insights into which populations may benefit more from HFNC or CPAP, further refining clinical decision-making. Third, many of the included studies had relatively short follow-up durations, limiting our ability to evaluate long-term outcomes. There was also considerable variability in how key outcomes, such as treatment failure, were defined across studies, which could contribute to heterogeneity and affect the comparability of results. Finally, none of the studies included a cost-effectiveness assessment, which is an important consideration for informing healthcare policy and clinical practice. Future research with larger, well-powered studies, standardized outcome definitions, longer follow-up periods, and access to granular patient-level data is essential to address these gaps and enhance the precision and applicability of treatment recommendations.Our findings warrant careful consideration of imprecision and evidence fragility. The wide confidence intervals for treatment failure (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.63-2.27) and mechanical ventilation (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.60-1.46) span both potential benefit and harm, reflecting the modest cumulative sample size (659 participants) and outcome heterogeneity. With only 88 total ventilation events across studies, even small outcome shifts could alter conclusions. The optimal information size for detecting meaningful differences would require approximately 800-1,000 patients-substantially more than available. These limitations underscore the need for larger trials with standardized outcomes before drawing definitive conclusions about HFNC versus CPAP efficacy.ConclusionsThis meta-analysis demonstrates that CPAP and HFNC show comparable efficacy in preventing invasive mechanical ventilation in children with acute bronchiolitis, with no significant difference in length of hospital stay. While our initial analysis showed no significant difference in treatment failure rates, sensitivity analysis revealed potentially higher treatment failure with HFNC. Both modalities effectively reduce respiratory effort through different physiological mechanisms. HFNC may serve as a viable alternative to CPAP, particularly in resource-limited settings, offering practical advantages in administration and patient comfort despite potentially higher treatment failure rates. Study limitations include small sample sizes and the inability to conduct subgroup analyses. Future research with larger cohorts and access to individual patient data is essential to refine treatment recommendations based on specific patient characteristics and disease severity."}

Additionally, identifying gaps and the risk of bias in existing research may inform future studies and advancements in acute heart failure diagnostics.", "body": "1IntroductionDyspnea is a frequent complaint in emergency departments [1]. Among its diverse causes, acute heart failure is the cause in 50% of the cases, contributing to over one million emergency department admissions annually in the United States and Europe, respectively [2, 3]. Pulmonary congestion, defined as the accumulation of fluid in the lungs due to increased pressure in the pulmonary capillaries, is observed in 75% of acute heart failure patients [1, 4]. More than 50% of patients with acute heart failure also experience pleural effusion, characterized by fluid accumulation in the pleural cavity, further exacerbating respiratory distress [5, 6]. With an aging population, the incidence and burden of acute heart failure and its complications are expected to increase significantly in the coming years [7, 8].As the primary treatment, diuretics effectively reduce intravascular volume and preload, thereby alleviating pulmonary congestion and pleural effusion [9]. Rapid identification and management of these conditions are crucial, as timely administration of diuretics can prevent further cardiac compromise and respiratory failure [10]. Furthermore, rapid stabilization and up‐titration of guideline‐directed heart failure treatment during and after admission significantly improve long‐term outcomes, including reduced symptoms and lower readmission rates [11].Diagnosing pulmonary congestion and pleural effusion presents challenges in clinical practice due to the nonspecific aetiology of the cardinal symptom dyspnea [12, 13]. Echocardiography for diagnosing acute heart failure is often unavailable in emergency departments as it requires specialized cardiologic expertise. Chest radiography is routinely used for the detection of pulmonary congestion and pleural effusion, but it has low diagnostic accuracies, leading to 20% of patients with acute heart failure initially being misdiagnosed and mistreated [14, 15]. Chest radiographs, when performed standing, miss up to 10% of substantial effusions [16, 17, 18, 19].The European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging recommends lung ultrasound (LUS) as a diagnostic tool for assessing pulmonary congestion in acute settings due to its speed, low cost, and broad availability [20]. The ESC 2021 guidelines for acute heart failure further endorse the consideration of LUS in the diagnostic workup for acute heart failure [9]. Nevertheless, LUS is not without its limitations. The interpretation of B‐lines—hyperechoic artifacts that reflect the presence of extravascular lung water—is complicated by their lack of specificity, as B‐lines can also be present in conditions such as pneumonia, interstitial lung disease, and acute respiratory distress syndrome [20]. Additionally, whereas LUS can identify pleural effusion, its role in the diagnosis of acute heart failure remains inconsistent [20, 21].If results are inconclusive from LUS and chest radiographs, chest computed tomography (CT) is proposed as a secondary option to differentiate pulmonary congestion from other potential causes [22]. Although CT has demonstrated superiority over chest radiographs in identifying pulmonary congestion [23], its routine implementation in emergency departments is hampered by cost, radiation, and availability issues. Another not yet implemented method is the novel method, Remote dielectric sensing (ReDS). ReDS is an operator‐independent bedside method that within minutes estimates lung fluid content using electromagnetic waves [24, 25].1.1Why is This Review Important?Accurate and timely diagnosis of pulmonary congestion and pleural effusion is essential in acute care settings, where diagnostic precision can directly impact patient outcomes. However, current practice continues to rely heavily on chest radiographs as the primary diagnostic method, despite well‐documented limitations in its sensitivity and specificity [15, 26]. Over the past two decades, advancements in diagnostic technologies, such as LUS, CT, and ReDS, have demonstrated potential for improved diagnostic accuracy. Yet, clinical adoption of these newer methods remains inconsistent, creating a need for comprehensive evidence to guide their implementation.Previous systematic reviews have largely focused on LUS, either as a standalone method [27, 28, 29] or in comparison with chest radiograph [26, 30, 31, 32, 33]. For instance, a meta‐analysis by Maw et al. (2019) highlighted LUS as being more sensitive and specific than chest radiograph for detecting pulmonary congestion, reinforcing its value in acute care settings [26]. However, reviews that compare multiple imaging modalities across a broad range of technologies remain scarce, leaving clinicians without a clear understanding of the relative performance of newer methods. Recent advancements, such as the diagnostic potential of CT [23, 34] and the emerging role of ReDS [35, 36], have not yet been thoroughly analyzed in this context [12, 37]. Lindow et al. (2023) conducted a narrative review of non‐invasive imaging techniques for pulmonary congestion, including LUS, chest radiographs, CT, and MRI, but did not employ a meta‐analytic approach [38]. This review seeks to fill that gap by providing pooled estimates of sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios for these methods, offering a more robust comparison of their diagnostic value for pulmonary congestion and pleural effusion.Diagnostic methods like LUS show variability in their effectiveness to detect pulmonary congestion [26, 39], with sensitivities and specificities ranging widely in previous studies due to differences in patient populations [40, 41, 42, 43] and reference standards [26, 39, 44, 45]. This systematic review will address this by evaluating the existing evidence on current diagnostic methods, focusing on their applicability and reliability across different patient groups. It will also assess the risk of bias in the included studies to ensure the recommendations are based on high‐quality evidence.2AimsThis systematic review aims to summarize the existing evidence on chest radiography, LUS, CT, and ReDS for the detection of pulmonary congestion and pleural effusion.We aim to examine which methods offer the best sensitivity and specificity and to establish their roles in clinical practice, particularly in the context of rule‐in and rule‐out strategies. Moreover, we aim to examine the risk of bias for the included studies.2.1Rationale for Selection of Diagnostic Methods\n\nChest radiography is included for its common use as a first‐line diagnostic tool, as it is quick and available in most clinical settings. However, its effectiveness is limited by a lower sensitivity for detecting subtle or early signs of pulmonary issues, making a detailed review of its accuracy and potential for misdiagnosis necessary.\nLUS is chosen for its non‐invasive and rapid application, which is vital for prompt medical decision‐making. Nonetheless, its capability to specifically identify pulmonary congestion from other pulmonary conditions needs investigation in this review.\nCT is included for its superior imaging quality, which is critical in accurately differentiating between various causes of dyspnea. The review will assess its practicality and diagnostic value in emergency settings, given its higher cost and less frequent availability.\nReDS is examined for its novel approach of non‐invasively measuring lung fluid content. This method provides a fast and operator‐independent assessment, which could be advantageous. The systematic review will determine its accuracy and practical application compared to established methods.\n3MethodsWe designed the systematic review according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analysis Protocols (PRISMA‐P) [46] and recommendations from the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Diagnostic Test Accuracy [47]. The study protocol is registered in the PROSPERO database (Registration number: CRD420250651927).3.1Criteria for Including Studies3.1.1Types of StudiesWe will include prospective diagnostic studies, designed to assess the accuracy of specific methods for diagnosing pulmonary congestion and/or pleural effusion. The studies should compare the diagnostic capabilities of the method to a golden standard as defined by the trialists. We will include studies examining at least one or more of: chest radiography, LUS, CT, and ReDS (Figure 1). We will include studies irrespective of publication year or language.FIGURE 1Diagnostic methods to be evaluated in this review. CT, computed tomography; ReDS, remote dielectric sensing.3.1.2ParticipantsWe will include studies that recruited adult patients (> 18 years old), who had acute dyspnea and were hospitalized in an emergency department or any other in‐hospital setting. Included studies must use a trialist‐determined reference standard for diagnosing pulmonary congestion or pleural effusion. No exclusions will be made based on patient comorbidities.3.1.3InterventionStudies investigating the diagnostic accuracy of any of the following modalities for the two reference diagnoses will be included:\nChest radiographyLung ultrasoundChest CT scansRemote Dielectric Sensing\nNo restrictions will be applied to the scanning protocols for the chest radiography, LUS, or CT, including the use of contrast.3.1.4OutcomeFor the two reference diagnoses, the primary outcomes are:\nSensitivity (True Positive Rate): The proportion of true positives correctly identified by the diagnostic test.Specificity (True Negative Rate): The proportion of true negatives correctly identified by the diagnostic test.\nSecondary outcomes will be\nArea under the curve (AUC): Measures overall diagnostic test accuracy.Positive predictive value (PPV): Likelihood that individuals with a positive test result have the condition.Negative predictive value (NPV): Likelihood that individuals with a negative test result do not have the condition.Positive likelihood ratio (LR+): Ratio of true positive rate to the false positive rate.Negative likelihood ratio (LR−): Ratio of false negative rate to true negative rate.\nAll outcomes listed above will be extracted from each clinical study. For each outcome, we will identify if there are deviations from intended interventions, if outcomes are missing, inappropriately measured, or selectively reported. Since disease prevalence affects PPV and NPV, we will record and analyze disease prevalence for both pulmonary disease and heart failure. Additionally, sensitivity and specificity will be reported in relation to disease prevalence to account for its potential influence on diagnostic performance.4Search MethodsWe will search the following electronic bibliographic databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE) (MEDLINE Ovid), Excerpta Medica database (EMBASE) (Embase Ovid), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) (VHL Regional Portal), Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI‐EXPANDED) (Web of Science), Conference Proceedings Citation Index—Science (CPCI‐S) (Web of Science) to identify relevant trials. We will search all databases from their inception to the present. Trials will be included irrespective of language, publication status, publication year, and publication type.The bibliographies of included articles will be reviewed for potential additional articles. We will begin the search in April 2025. We will contact the authors of included studies by email asking for unpublished diagnostic trials.4.1Selection ProcessTitles and abstracts identified through systematic searches will be screened independently by at least two reviewers using Covidence software (Covidence systematic review software, Veritas Health Innovation, Melbourne, Australia, accessible at www.covidence.org). Reviewers will apply the above‐mentioned predefined screening criteria, and any disagreements over study inclusion or exclusion will be resolved through discussion between the two or, if needed, consultation with a third reviewer. Publications that pass the initial screening will undergo full‐text review. Eligibility discrepancies will be discussed, and authors of studies will be contacted for clarification if required.A PRISMA flow diagram will document the selection process, including reasons for exclusion at each stage.5Data Extraction and ManagementTwo reviewers will independently extract data from the included trials, and disagreements will be discussed with a third author. Duplicate publications and secondary reports of the same study will be excluded. Authors of included studies will be contacted for clarification or additional unpublished data where necessary.As part of the screening and data extraction process, studies will also be classified according to the degree of population selection, including whether they enrolled totally unselected patients, excluded individuals with pulmonary comorbidities, or excluded low‐risk populations (e.g., patients under 50 years).5.1Data ItemsThe following data will be extracted as relevant:\nGeneral information\n○First author name○Year of publication○Study design○Inclusion and exclusion criteria○Years of patient enrolment (start and end year of enrolment)○Number of patients screened and analyzed (sample size)○Description of the diagnostic index test, including protocol and technique○Description of reference diagnosis method○Main outcomes of sensitivity and specificity for the reference diagnosis\nParticipants\n○Summary demographics (age, sex)○Baseline comorbidities: Baseline prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, atrial fibrillation or flutter, and heart failure○Baseline left ventricular ejection fraction.○N‐terminal pro‐B‐type natriuretic peptide (NT‐proBNP) level during admission\n\n6Data Synthesis6.1Meta AnalysisMeta analyzes according to the international recommendations [47] and the eight‐step assessment by Jakobsen et al. [48] will be carried out. The effects will be evaluated with both fixed effects meta‐analyzes [49] and random effects meta‐analyzes [50]. The most conservative results (highest p value) will be reported, and the less conservative result will be considered in a sensitivity analysis. One primary outcome will be used, and the primary conclusions will be based on this outcome; therefore, a p value of 0.05 as the threshold for statistical significance for all outcomes will be considered. Our main conclusion will be based on the results from the primary outcomes at low‐risk of bias.For diagnostic accuracy, a hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) model will be used to synthesize the data [51]. The HSROC model accounts for variability across studies by assuming an underlying receiver operating characteristic curve within each study [52]. From this model, pooled estimates of sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratios will be calculated, along with corresponding 95% confidence intervals.Positive and negative likelihood ratios will also be derived. Positive and negative predictive values will be estimated using pooled sensitivity and specificity, as well as the overall prevalence of the included studies.A likelihood ratio test will assess differences in diagnostic performance between test modalities, and individual comparisons for sensitivity and specificity will also be performed. Statistical tests will be two‐sided with a significance level of 0.05. The χ\n2 and Wald tests will be used to calculate p values. Meta‐analysis will be performed using Stata V.17.47 and R studio version 4.4.1.6.2Assessment of HeterogeneityIndividual study results for sensitivity and specificity will be plotted on a forest plot to visually assess and explore study variability.We will secondly assess the presence of statistical heterogeneity using I\n2 statistic (i.e., the percentage of total variation across trials apart from random variation, with 0% indicating no observed heterogeneity and increasing percentages indicating increasing heterogeneity) and the restricted maximum likelihood method to estimate the heterogeneity variance.6.3Dealing With Missing DataAs the first option, all trial authors will be contacted to obtain any relevant missing data (i.e., for data extraction and for assessment of risk of bias, as specified above). We will not impute missing values for any outcomes in our primary analysis.7Risk of BiasAt least two investigators will independently assess the risk of bias in the included studies, based on the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies‐2 (QUADAS‐2) tool [53], outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Diagnostic Test Accuracy [47]. The risk of bias in the included studies will be assessed according to the following domains of bias:\n–Participant selection: Whether the study included consecutive patients or if patient selection was influenced by factors such as pulmonary comorbidities.–Index test: Whether the interpretation of the index test was blinded to the reference standard or other index tests.–Reference standard: The procedures used to conduct the reference standard and whether they were performed blinded to the index test.–Flow and timing: The time interval between patient admission and the administration of the index and reference tests.\nFor each domain, studies are rated as “low”, “high” or “unclear” for risk of bias. Meanwhile, a trial will be classified as overall “high risk of bias”, if at least one of the bias components are classified as “unclear” or “high risk of bias”. The main conclusions will be based on the results of outcomes at an overall low‐risk of bias.To explore variability in population characteristics and ensure clinical relevance, we will conduct subgroup analyzes based on study populations and their associated risk of bias. Specifically, we will separately evaluate diagnostic performance in studies with a high or unclear risk of bias (e.g., due to participant selection) and those with a low‐risk of bias. This approach ensures a robust assessment of diagnostic accuracy while addressing potential biases stemming from differences in study design or population characteristics. Additionally, for studies that have performed a direct head‐to‐head comparison of diagnostic methods, we will conduct a separate analysis. These studies provide valuable insights into relative diagnostic performance under comparable conditions, as they assess different methods within the same population using the same reference standard.7.1Assessment of Reporting BiasesWe will use a funnel plot to assess reporting bias if 10 or more trials are included. We will visually inspect funnel plots to assess the risk of bias.8DiscussionThe proposed systematic review and meta‐analysis aims to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of several non‐invasive methods in diagnosing pulmonary congestion and pleural effusion. With the rising global prevalence of heart failure, the development of reliable and effective diagnostic tools is critical to ensure timely and accurate clinical evaluations in emergency settings.Unlike previous reviews, which primarily focus on LUS alone [27, 28, 29] or compare it only with chest radiography [26, 30, 31, 32, 33], this systematic review takes a broader approach by evaluating multiple imaging modalities, including advancements like CT [23, 34] and ReDS [35, 36]. These technologies, whereas promising, have not been thoroughly analyzed in a comparative context. Additionally, we will assess the risk of bias across studies to ensure the findings are grounded in high‐quality evidence.Variability in the reported diagnostic accuracy of methods, particularly LUS, illustrates the complexities of synthesizing evidence across studies. Sensitivities and specificities for LUS have been reported to range from 58%–97% and 69%–94%, respectively [26, 39]. This variability may stem from differences in study populations, with some including younger patients and excluding patients with pulmonary comorbidities, whereas others include elderly, critically ill patients [40, 41, 42, 43]. The diversity in selection criteria, geographic location, and clinical settings further complicates the generalizability of findings to real‐world emergency settings, where patients often present with multiple comorbidities. Particularly, “grey zone” patients, who lack clear clinical signs and often have overlapping conditions, represent a group where accurate diagnostic tools are most needed to differentiate pulmonary congestion or pleural effusion from other causes of dyspnea. These variations underline the need for systematic reviews to assess the diagnostic accuracy of each method and their performance in specific patient populations and clinical contexts, highlighting how different factors can influence diagnostic outcomes across studies. Moreover, the absence of a universally accepted ‘gold standard’ for diagnosing conditions like pulmonary congestion complicates the evaluation of diagnostic tools. This lack of definitive reference standards can skew the perceived effectiveness of a method. Furthermore, diagnostic studies often emphasize sensitivity and specificity, but in clinical practice, the positive and negative predictive values, which depend on the disease prevalence in the study population, are typically more relevant. Given these complexities, systematic reviews that assess not only the diagnostic accuracy of each method but also their performance in specific patient populations and clinical contexts are crucial.Another notable gap lies in the evaluation of pleural effusion, for which clear guidelines are lacking. The ESC 2021 guidelines for acute heart failure, for example, provide no specific recommendations for the detection of pleural effusion. Addressing this void by systematically assessing diagnostic tools for pleural effusion alongside pulmonary congestion is essential for developing comprehensive diagnostic strategies.Looking ahead, advancements like the integration of artificial intelligence in diagnostic tools such as radiology, LUS, and echocardiography hold promise for improving accuracy, consistency, and possibly speed, especially in busy emergency settings [54]. However, a thorough evaluation of existing evidence is crucial before considering the widespread implementation of these technologies.Author Contributions\nAnne Sophie Overgaard Olesen: conceptualization, methodology, writing – original draft, review and editing, visualization.

Machine learning techniques resulted in unique 17- and 14-protein models for HFrEF and HFpEF that predict 1-year mortality. Discrimination was assessed via C-index and 1-year area under the curve (AUC), and survival curves were visualized. PRSs were also compared with Meta-Analysis Global Group in Chronic HF (MAGGIC) score and NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide) measurements and further assessed for sensitivity to disease progression in longitudinal samples (HFrEF: n=396; 1107 samples; HFpEF: n=175; 350 samples).RESULTS:In validation, the HFpEF PRS performed significantly better (P≤0.1) for mortality prediction (C-index, 0.79; AUC, 0.82) than MAGGIC (C-index, 0.71; AUC, 0.74) and NT-proBNP (PRS C-index, 0.76 and AUC, 0.81 versus NT-proBNP C-index, 0.72 and AUC, 0.76). The HFrEF PRS performed comparably to MAGGIC (PRS C-index, 0.76 and AUC, 0.83 versus MAGGIC C-index, 0.75 and AUC, 0.84) but had a significantly better C-Index (P=0.026) than NT-proBNP (PRS C-index, 0.75 and AUC, 0.78 versus NT-proBNP C-index, 0.73 and AUC, 0.77). PRS included known HF pathophysiology biomarkers (93%) and novel proteins (7%). Longitudinal assessment revealed that HFrEF and HFpEF PRSs were higher and increased more over time in individuals who experienced a fatal event during follow-up.CONCLUSIONS:PRSs can provide valid, accurate, and dynamic prognostic estimates for patients with HF. This approach has the potential to improve longitudinal monitoring of patients and facilitate personalized care.", "body": "WHAT IS NEW?To our knowledge, these are the first protein-only prognostic models of heart failure (HF) mortality for participants with reduced and preserved ejection fraction (EF).HF with reduced EF and HF with preserved EF proteomic models were comparable to or exceeded the performance of traditional risk factors.Development of these models using large unbiased machine learning methods identified novel biomarkers of HF mortality, which may expand our understanding of HF physiology.WHAT ARE THE CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS?Clinicians should be aware that these proteomic models provide an easy-to-interpret 1-year absolute risk score of HF mortality that is accurate across a diverse and heterogeneous HF population from a single information source (blood sample).Longitudinal assessment of these proteomic models demonstrated the utility of protein scanning as a dynamic information source that is sensitive to individualized changes.These proteomic models of HF with preserved EF and HF with reduced EF may improve longitudinal monitoring and enable more personalized patient care.Heart failure (HF) is a debilitating disease that affects over 6.5 million people in the United States.1 Importantly, HF is a heterogeneous disorder marked by highly variable prognoses, and clinicians continue to be challenged with risk assessment.2 Current biomarkers such as BNP (B-type natriuretic peptide) and NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-BNP) are commonly used to diagnose and predict morbidity and mortality3 but do not provide a quantitative expectation of outcome that is readily understood and medically actionable (eg, an actual numeric estimate of the probability of death over a specific time period). While clinical prognostic risk calculators have also been developed to provide absolute risk estimates (eg, Meta-Analysis Global Group in Chronic HF [MAGGIC] score and Seattle HF Model),4,5 these can be difficult to use in practice, depend largely on static or immutable factors not sensitive to individualized changes from therapeutic interventions, and have large prediction intervals when assessed at an individual level. Furthermore, the acknowledgment that HF pathophysiology is far more complex than a single biomarker or comorbid condition helps explain the lack of widespread adoption of current risk stratification tools. Thus, a more comprehensive, biologically based, and dynamic assessment of HF risk would be highly desirable to aid in medical decision-making and evaluating responses to therapies.The medical community has increasingly pursued precision medicine initiatives that seek to accurately risk-stratify patients with HF based on detailed biological knowledge, anticipating that it will lead to personalized risk estimates and treatment decisions.6,7 While this could theoretically reduce cost and improve outcomes, there remains an unmet need for sensitive, accurate, and cost-effective prognostic tests whose results are readily modifiable as conditions change and that can be monitored over time. Proteomics holds promise in this regard in that the circulating proteome is dynamic and associated with disease risk and outcomes in many cardiovascular conditions.8–10 Using large-scale proteomics, we previously developed a proteomic model that predicts a 4-year risk for a major cardiovascular event, defined as the first incidence of myocardial infarction, stroke, HF hospitalization, or all-cause death, among individuals with stable coronary heart disease including participants with HF.8,10 While there have been previous proteomics studies investigating the association of different proteins with HF mortality,11–15 to the best of our knowledge, no prognostic HF tool for participants with different subtypes of HF has been published, which is based solely on proteins and derived by large-scale unbiased approaches.In this study, we sought to develop protein-only risk prediction models that do not rely on clinical data specifically for participants with different subtypes of prevalent HF (HF with reduced ejection fraction [HFrEF]; ejection fraction [EF] <40% and HF with preserved EF [HFpEF]; EF ≥50%) providing 1-year absolute risk estimates of mortality.METHODSData AvailabilityPre-existing data access policies for each of the 4 cohort studies used in these analyses specify that research data requests can be submitted to their respective steering committees, will be promptly reviewed for consent, confidentiality, intellectual property restrictions, and privacy laws considerations, and will not unreasonably be refused.Study DesignLeft ventricular EF cutoffs for patient samples used in HFrEF and HFpEF model training and validation were based on the European Society of Cardiology and American Heart Association guidelines.3,16 Patients with mid-range left ventricular EF were not included in model training or validation.Patient PopulationsThe training and validation of HF models were conducted in 3 separate HF cohorts: the PHFS (Penn HF Study),17 the ARIC study (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities),18 and the HFGR (Henry Ford HF Genomic Registry).19 In addition, the longitudinal performance of the HFrEF and HFpEF models was tested in the Bio-SHiFT cohort (The Role of Biomarkers and Echocardiography in Prediction of Prognosis of Chronic HF Patients)20 and TOPCAT (Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function HF With an Aldosterone Antagonist Trial).21 The flow diagram for training and validation of the HFrEF and HFpEF models from these cohorts is shown in Figure 1. A full description of each study can be found in the Supplemental Methods. Each study was approved by their respective institutional review boards, and informed consent was obtained from each patient. Demographics for the patients from each study included in the HFrEF and HFpEF model training and validation are described in Tables 1 and 2.Table 1.HFrEF Cohort Description: Demographic and End Point Table for HFrEF Model Training and Validation Data SetsTable 2.HFpEF Cohort Description: Demographic and End Point Table for HFpEF Model Training and Validation Data SetsFigure 1.Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) proteomic risk score overview.

A full description of the SomaScan Assay, data normalization, calibration, and data quality control processes is provided in the Supplemental Methods. Specificity confirmation and precision of aptamer target binding for the protein features included in the HFrEF and HFpEF models are included in Tables S1 and S2.Statistical AnalysisTraining and Validation of HFrEF and HFpEF ModelsFractions of data from multiple data sets were used as a common machine learning technique to develop models that mitigate overfitting while capturing disease heterogeneity and improving the generalizability of predictions22. Data sets were split into training, tuning (feature selection, parameter tuning, and cross-validation), and holdout validation (a holdout set that is used only to assess the final model and is not used for model development) data sets. Stratification of the data sets for HFrEF and HFpEF model training and validation is shown in Table S3. Proportions were chosen based on data availability (80% used for training, with additional data sets becoming available for tuning and validation) and ensured that demographics and mortality rate distributions were similar between the data set splits.The HFrEF and HFpEF models are accelerated failure time survival models, using a Weibull distribution, which predicts the risk of all-cause death at 1 year reported as a probability. As opposed to Cox proportional hazard models, accelerated failure time models allow for parameterization such that covariates either accelerate or decelerate the risk of HF mortality and provide a resulting predictive probability that can be more easily interpreted. Model features were chosen and fit using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. Both the HFrEF and HFpEF models were evaluated for discrimination using the Harrel C-index (the ability of a model to discriminate between random pairs of individuals with different times to event) and the 1-year area under the curve (AUC; the ability of the model to dichotomize the population into 2 classes at a defined timepoint). Models were required to exceed predefined performance criteria in a regulatory environment; a C-index and 1-year AUC ≥0.7 to ensure the proteomic models were at least equivalent to BNP discrimination in predicting death. A full description of statistical approaches and parameterization used to develop the HFrEF and HFpEF models and model equations can be found in the Supplemental Methods.Sensitivity to Change in Risk AnalysesRepeated assessment of the HFrEF model over time was tested on longitudinal samples from the Bio-SHiFT study (Table S4). One-year HFrEF risk predictions were calculated on all serially collected plasma samples in the study. Linear mixed models were used to characterize the baseline risk and how it changes over time in the full data set. The analysis was stratified by event status: participants who had a fatal event after the third timepoint (closest blood sample collected to the event) versus participants who did not have a fatal event during follow-up (2.5 years). Estimated marginal means were calculated for each timepoint by event status. Post hoc comparisons of mean risk at each timepoint and longitudinal changes in mean risk were conducted between the event groups. The Tukey and Dunnett adjusted P values were reported for each of the comparisons, respectively.The HFpEF model was assessed on longitudinal samples from the TOPCAT study (Table S5). One-year HFpEF risk predictions were calculated, and change in risk predictions was assessed for paired samples from baseline to 1 year in participants approaching an event (all-cause death) versus participants who remain event-free. Mean HFpEF risks were calculated for each timepoint by event status. A 1-tailed t test was used to compare mean risk at each timepoint and the change in mean risk from baseline between the event groups. A false discovery rate correction was applied to the resulting P values to correct for multiple comparisons at each timepoint.HFrEF and HFpEF model performance metrics (C-index and 1-year AUC) were calculated on all baseline samples in the Bio-SHiFT and TOPCAT study, respectively. The CIs on model performance metrics were calculated by bootstrapping the data set 200 times, calculating the metric each time, and then taking the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles of the 200 values.Functional Enrichment and Protein-Protein Interaction AnalysesFunctional analyses were performed with the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (v. 6.8),23 using UniProt accession IDs for gene labeling and Homo sapiens as species. Features chosen for model training (i.e., top 50 univariate features for HFrEF and the 39 overlapping features between univariate analyses conducted on the training and tuning data sets for HFpEF) were utilized for HFrEF and HFpEF enrichment analyses, respectively, while the entire v4.0 SomaScan Assay menu was used as background.Clinical Prognostic MarkersCorrelation between the NT-proBNP SOMAmer reagent (seq 7655.11) and clinically measured NT-proBNP (ELISA) was assessed using the Pearson correlation coefficient in participants from the HFGR cohort (with both measurements available). NT-proBNP values were measured using stored EDTA plasma samples, collected at enrollment, and stored at −80 °C, using an immunoelectrochemiluminescence assay on the Modular Analytics E 170 system (Roche Diagnostics), performed by ACS Biomarker (Amsterdam, Netherlands). This assay has <0.001% cross-reactivity with bioactive BNP. The Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated on the log10-transformed clinically measured NT-proBNP and SOMAmer reagent measured NT-proBNP. To evaluate the prognostic performance of NT-proBNP in HF mortality, the C-index and 1-year AUC between the log10-transformed relative fluorescence unit measurement of NT-proBNP and the days until death were calculated for patients with HFrEF and HFpEF, separately.Clinical data to calculate MAGGIC scores were only available for the HFGR cohort. The 80% holdout validation portion of this data set was used for comparative analyses against the HFrEF and HFpEF proteomic risk scores (PRSs). The C-index and 1-year AUC between the continuous MAGGIC score and the days until death were calculated for patients with HFrEF and HFpEF, separately. To test for differences in AUC between the PRS (HFrEF or HFpEF) and the clinical prognostic marker (MAGGIC score or NT-proBNP), a 1-sided DeLong test was applied using a significance level of 0.1. To test for differences in C-indices between the PRS (HFrEF or HFpEF) and the clinical prognostic marker (MAGGIC score or NT-proBNP), a 1-tailed Z-test (for right-censored survival data) was applied using a significance level of 0.05.The combined performance of the clinical prognostic marker (MAGGIC score or NT-proBNP) and PRS (HFrEF or HFpEF) was calculated using a linear combination: β1*PRS +β2*clinical prognostic marker, where β1 and β2 are coefficients from fitting a Cox proportional hazard regression model with the PRS (HFrEF or HFpEF) predictive probability and the clinical prognostic marker (MAGGIC score or NT-proBNP) as predictors on the corresponding validation data set. Performance was assessed using C-index and 1-year AUC, and significance was tested using a 1-sided Z-test and a 1-sided DeLong test, respectively. Analysis used R, version 3.4.3, in Linux on x86 64-bit architecture, with packages used for model building and assessment including caret (6.0.88), survival (3.2.11), and pROC (1.17.0.1).RESULTSPrognostic Models for HFrEF and HFpEFSeparate accelerated failure time models with Weibull distribution were trained and validated for patients with HFrEF and HFpEF. The HFrEF and HFpEF PRSs were trained in 1247 patients with HFrEF and 725 patients with HFpEF and validated in 762 patients with HFrEF and 785 patients with HFpEF, respectively, and predict the absolute likelihood of all-cause death within 1 year. There were 152 deaths (12.2%) within 1 year in the HFrEF training data and 72 deaths (9.4%) within 1 year in the HFrEF validation data. The event rate was lower in the HFpEF population with 46 deaths (6.3%) within 1 year in the HFpEF training data and 41 deaths (5.2%) within 1 year in the HFpEF validation data. The HFrEF and HFpEF models include 17- and 14-protein features (protein-binding aptamers), respectively, and both models use samples from across 3 independent studies (Figure 1; Tables 1 and 2). The resulting models are a balance of novel and established biomarkers; the proteins included in the HFrEF and HFpEF models are listed in Table S6, with their proportionate contribution to the model output, along with the coefficients of variation for each analyte. The linear combination of the aptamers for each model can be found in the Supplemental Methods.The HFrEF and HFpEF models had a C-index of 0.75 and 0.76 and a 1-year AUC of 0.78 and 0.81, respectively, in the validation data sets (Table 3). The median time to event was 4.9 months in the HFrEF validation data set and 4.2 months in the HFpEF validation data set. Model performance across all training and validation data sets can be found in Table 3. In addition to providing a numeric estimate of the probability of death within 1 year, relative risk bins were generated based on quartiles for both models. Survival curves stratified by relative risk bin for baseline HFrEF and HFpEF protein-risk are depicted in Figure 2. Observed 1-year fatal event rates across the 3 risk bins (low, medium, and high) were 1.3%, 9.3%, and 27.4% in HFrEF and 0%, 2.5%, and 13.3% in HFpEF, respectively.Table 3.HFrEF and HFpEF PRS Performances: Performance Metrics for the HFrEF and HFpEF Training, Tuning, and Validation Data SetsFigure 2.Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) proteomic risk score Kaplan-Meier. Observed survival probability and average time to event (death) in the combined HFrEF (A) and HFpEF (B) validation data set when stratified by relative risk bins. The Kaplan-Meier point estimate of observed events up to 12 months, stratified by risk bin: low risk, bottom quartile (absolute risk score 0≥x≤0.057 for HFrEF and 0≥x≤0.017 for HFpEF); medium risk, middle 2 quartiles (absolute risk score 0.057>x≤0.187 for HFrEF and 0.017>x≤0.081 for HFpEF); and high risk, top quartile (absolute risk score 0.187>x≤1.00 for HFrEF and 0.081>x≤1.00 for HFpEF).Increases Over Time in the PRS Herald Adverse OutcomesThe baseline 1-year HFrEF PRS was 9.1% higher (P<0.001) in patients with a fatal event compared with those with no fatal event and was even higher in available follow-up samples for those who had fatal events subsequent to the follow-up sample (Table S7; Figure 3). HFrEF 1-year risk score for all-cause death increased by 3.0% more from baseline to timepoint 2 and 3.2% more from baseline to timepoint 3 in available samples for those who had fatal events compared with the no fatal event group (P<0.05). The performance (based on C-index and AUC) of the HFrEF model was also assessed in the Bio-SHiFT samples from the baseline timepoint and was shown to be comparable in this data set to the HFrEF training and validation data sets with a 1-year AUC of 0.78 and C-index of 0.77 (Table 3).Figure 3.Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) proteomic risk score change in risk.

Bio-SHiFT indicates The Role of Biomarkers and Echocardiography in Predication of Prognosis of Chronic Heart Failure Patients; and TOPCAT, Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure with an Aldosterone Antagonist Trial.Similarly, the 1-year HFpEF PRS was 8.6% higher (P<0.001) at baseline in patients with a fatal event compared with those with no fatal event and 10.9% higher at 1 year (P<0.001; Table S8; Figure 3). HFpEF PRS increased by 3.4% more from baseline to 1 year in participants with a fatal event versus no fatal event although this change was not statistically significant (P=0.81). HFpEF model performance was assessed in the baseline TOPCAT samples and shown to be comparable in this data set to the HFpEF training and validation data sets with a 1-year AUC of 0.75 and C-index of 0.74 (Table 3).Biological Pathway AnalysesA formal statistical functional enrichment analysis of the final protein features in the HFrEF and HFpEF models would not be valid because of intentional biases in machine learning, which limits the inclusion of correlated features. To understand biological pathways underlying the proteomic signal detected by our models, we explored gene ontology analyses of the subset of proteins utilized in the training of the HFrEF and HFpEF PRSs. Subsets of proteins selected for HFrEF model training were enriched for kidney failure disease pathology, while proteins selected for HFpEF model training were enriched for more heart-specific diseases, including cardiomyopathy, HF, heart decompensation, and tachycardia. All associations between individual model proteins and HF can be found in Tables S9 and S10.Comparison of Proteomic HFpEF and HFrEF Models to Current State Clinical Prognostic MarkersBecause clinically measured NT-proBNP values were not available for many data sets, the prognostic performance of the NT-proBNP SOMAmer reagent (seq 7655.11) was used as the comparator. The NT-proBNP SOMAmer reagent has been previously shown to be highly correlated with clinically measured (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) NT-proBNP.10 NT-proBNP measurements by a standard clinical laboratory assay were only available for 1 study, HFGR. In the participants with both measurements available (n=494 paired measurements), the SOMAmer reagent NT-proBNP results were highly correlated with the clinically measured NT-proBNP. The Pearson correlation coefficient between these 2 measures was 0.92, indicating a strong linear correlation (Figure S1).To compare the performance of the NT-proBNP SOMAmer reagent as a predictor for all-cause death in validation data sets to that of the HF PRS signals, we calculated the C-index and 1-year AUCs separately for patients with HFrEF and HFpEF. The HFrEF and HFpEF PRSs had a significantly higher C-index than the NT-proBNP SOMAmer reagent alone (Table 4). NT-proBNP had a C-index of 0.73 for HFrEF patients and 0.72 for patients with HFpEF, whereas the HFrEF model had a C-index of 0.75 and the HFpEF model had a C-index of 0.76. Similarly, the 1-year survival AUCs for NT-proBNP were lower than the HFrEF and HFpEF PRSs, but only the HFpEF PRS was significant. Combining the PRS (HFrEF or HFpEF) with NT-proBNP did not significantly improve performance over PRS alone (Table 4).Table 4.Comparative Analyses: HFrEF and HFpEF PRSs vs NT-proBNPClinical data required to calculate the MAGGIC score were also only available in the HFGR cohort. To compare the performance of MAGGIC score as a predictor for all-cause death in the 80% HFGR holdout validation data set to the HFrEF and HFpEF PRSs, we calculated the C-index and 1-year AUCs (for patients with HFrEF and HFpEF separately). The HFpEF PRS performed significantly better than the MAGGIC score (Table 5). MAGGIC score had a C-index of 0.71 and a 1-year AUC of 0.74, whereas the HFpEF PRS had a C-index of 0.79 and a 1-year AUC of 0.82. The HFrEF PRS performed comparably to the MAGGIC score, the MAGGIC score had a C-index of 0.75 and 1-year AUC of 0.84, and the HFrEF PRS had a C-index of 0.76 and 1-year AUC of 0.83. Combining the PRS (HFrEF or HFpEF) with the MAGGIC score did not significantly improve performance over the PRS alone (Table 5). However, for both HFrEF and HFpEF, the PRS score remains significantly associated with outcomes even when adjusted for MAGGIC score (HFrEF P<0.0001; HFpEF P<0.0001), suggesting that the PRS provides additional information not captured by MAGGIC score alone.Table 5.Comparative Analyses: HFrEF and HFpEF PRSs vs MAGGICThe residual effects of age on the HFpEF and HFrEF models were also assessed because age is known to be a risk factor for HF mortality.24 During the modeling process, deviance residuals were assessed on the training data results, which represent a wide age range of 18.4 to 88.2 years of the HF population. While there is some positive correlation with age (more so in HFpEF), the low r2 values suggest that there is not a strong correlation with age (r2 of HFrEF residuals with events=0.064; P<0.0001; r2 of HFpEF residuals with events=0.157; P<0.0001).DISCUSSIONIn this study, we developed proteomic prognostic models that use a total of 27 unique circulating protein markers to predict 1-year mortality risk in patients with HFrEF and HFpEF using solely protein measurements. HFrEF and HFpEF PRSs were trained and validated across multiple large and diverse cohorts to better encompass the heterogeneity within HF populations and maximize generalizability. Stratification into distinct baseline risk groups, with the 2 middle-risk quartiles grouped together (to create the medium-risk bin), showed a wide dynamic range in 1-year observed fatal event rates between participants in the low versus high-risk bins. Longitudinal assessment of the PRS in the Bio-SHiFT study and TOPCAT trial showed fidelity to detecting changes in mortality risk over time. The HFpEF model performed significantly better than both NT-proBNP and the validated clinical risk score (MAGGIC), while the HFrEF model performed comparably to both NT-proBNP and MAGGIC scores. Improvements in AUC and C-index for the HFpEF PRS compared with NT-proBNP and MAGGIC score were comparable or greater than those seen in previous studies, for example, studies adding calcium score to traditional models for predicting the risk of incident coronary artery disease (C-index improved by 0.04–0.05), suggesting that these are clinically meaningful differences.25,26Our findings have strong external validity in the context of existing literature on risk assessment in HF and circulating proteins. Of the 27 unique proteins utilized in our HF prognosis models, 25 (93%) are associated with known HF pathophysiology and 16 (59%) have been previously identified in HF populations using the SomaScan Assay (Tables S9 and S10). Previously described biomarkers of HF prognosis incorporated in our models include NT-proBNP, GDF-15 (growth/differentiation factor 15), WFDC2 (WAP 4-disulfide core domain protein 2), ST2 (interleukin-1 receptor-like 1), and TnTc2 (cardiac muscle troponin T).3 We also identified novel proteins for the prediction of mortality in HFpEF: ALP (antileukoproteinase) and chordin-like protein 1. Although we did not find previously published evidence for an association between these 2 proteins and HF, these proteins are linked to other cardiovascular pathophysiology (eg, cardiac hypertrophy; Tables S9 and S10), suggesting the biological plausibility of our novel findings. While NT-proBNP was selected as a feature in both the HFrEF and HFpEF models, the proteomic approach was better able to predict HF mortality compared with NT-proBNP measurements alone, suggesting that they capture additional important features of the pathophysiology of HF with meaningful gains in C-index and AUC.One inconsistency between these findings and previous studies was that there was no overlap between proteins in our models compared with a recently developed proteomic score by Gui et al.12 The differences in these proteomic findings are most likely indicative of differing approaches used for model training. The current study utilized a proteome-only approach, while Gui et al12 forced adjustment for NT-proBNP and MAGGIC score.Finally, these models improve upon many of the limitations of individual marker measurements or clinical risk scores currently used for HF prognostication. For example, larger protein panels have an advantage over NT-proBNP alone, as the levels of the latter can misinform risk in individual patients, such as those with atrial fibrillation or obesity. In addition, the multi-protein scores change with risk over time as they are not reliant on static, immutable clinical factors. The MAGGIC clinical score contains predictors, many of which are not readily modifiable including age, time since diagnosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, male sex, diabetes, β-blocker status, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin-receptor status, lower systolic blood pressure, and body mass index.5We have addressed the many strengths of these models; however, there are also limitations that should be discussed. We did not study the effects of including clinical covariates in our models; however, we did assess whether combining our models with NT-proBNP and MAGGIC scores improved performance. The intent of this study was to evaluate the potential of the plasma proteome as the sole information source for developing prognostic HF models. This approach enabled machine learning algorithms to include proteins that likely capture the biology of key clinical and demographic factors.9 Furthermore, requiring multiple sources of data would make these models less convenient in routine clinical care, has the potential for increasing costs if further testing were required, and would not allow for scaling of multiple proteomic-only tests to be applied to a single blood sample. The data sets used to develop the PRS may not reflect the impact of newer therapies, and some observational cohorts are missing data about the adoption of guideline therapies. Finally, neither model has been assessed for changes in response to medication, which, if successful, could confirm that a desired treatment effect has occurred and allow for more personalized therapies.Overall, these data support that the plasma proteome could contain prognostic information and provide a powerful tool for understanding HF physiology. Our report provides a key step forward in precision medicine, demonstrating that proteomic models discovered and validated on holdout sets with an aptamer platform (SomaScan) can accurately predict HF mortality at 1 timepoint, as well as serially over time. Whether this approach has the potential to improve longitudinal monitoring of patients and facilitate personalized care remains to be proven.ARTICLE INFORMATIONAcknowledgmentsThe authors are grateful to the participants in all the cohorts and to the study teams, physicians, and medical staff.

{"PMCID": "12246986", "title": "Efficacy of different modes of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation delivery for patients with heart failure: a systematic review and network meta-analysis", "abstract": "BackgroundCardiac rehabilitation (CR) has been shown to be an effective treatment for patients with heart failure (HF). However, the effect of different modes of CR delivery on HF remains unclear. The purpose of this study is to perform a large-scale pairwise and network meta-analysis (NMA) on the impact of various exercise types on patients with HF using multiple indicators.MethodsRandomized controlled trials (RCTs) published between 2000 and October 2023 were systematically searched in PubMed (Medline), the Cochrane Library and Web of Science. Statistical analysis was performed by STATASE16 with the network pack. The primary outcomes focused on functional capacity and health-related quality of life (QoL), such as peak VO2, six-minute walk test (6MWT), maximum workload, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), maximum heart rate (MHR), and Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ) scores. All relevant studies reported well-defined or accessible exposures and presented clear data on any one or more of the six items above before and after exercise rehabilitation.ResultsIn total, 122 RCTs were ultimately included in the final analysis. Pairwise analyses revealed aerobic training (AT) can improve peak VO2 (2.49 mL/kg/min) and LVEF (2.97%). High-intensity interval training (HIIT) was associated with an improvement in peak VO2 (3.91 mL/kg/min), LVEF (6.68%), 6MWT (65.4 m) and MLHFQ score (−10.34). As shown in the NMA, the rank order of effectiveness based on the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) values for peak VO2, was HIIT (SUCRA: 90.8%), strength training (ST) (74.7%), AT (64.4%), combined training (CT) (41.7%) and inspiratory muscle training (IMT) (18.3%). The order of effectiveness for LVEF based on SCURA values was HIIT (90.5%), AT (77.8%), CT (50.3%), ST (49.9%) and IMT (7.7%).ConclusionsVarious types of exercise, especially HIIT, can improve QoL, cardiac function, LVEF, and exercise tolerance in patients with HF. The results of this analysis should inform future exercise guideline personalized recommendations and prescriptions for HF patients.", "body": "Highlight boxKey findings• Various exercise types, especially high-intensity interval training (HIIT), can improve quality of life, cardiac function, left ventricular ejection fraction, and exercise tolerance in patients with heart failure (HF).What is known and what is new?• Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) has been shown to be an effective treatment for patients with HF.• HIIT is probably the most effective mode of exercise in CR.What is the implication, and what should change now?• A more detailed and systematic evaluation of the different types of exercise and future exercise guideline personalized recommendations and prescriptions should be made for HF patients.IntroductionHeart failure (HF) is a clinical syndrome characterized by structural or functional abnormalities of the heart, leading to elevated intracardial pressure and insufficient cardiac output either at rest or during exercise (1), and it represents the common terminal stage of various cardiovascular diseases. Globally, more than 64 million individuals are afflicted by HF (2), and in developed countries, the incidence of diagnosed HF is estimated to be 1–2% of the general adult population (3). The prognosis of HF is even more dismal, as a recent meta-analysis that examined over 1.5 million patients diagnosed with full-form HF indicated that the 5- and 10-year survival rates were 57% and 35%, respectively (4). HF has emerged as one of the most severe diseases threatening human health and life worldwide (5). Therefore, considerable efforts have been devoted to improving the treatment and management of HF. Although medical therapy for HF has been demonstrated to be effective and widely utilized, it is not devoid of drawbacks. Adverse reactions and contraindications, along with high financial burdens and low adherence rates, have sparked increasing interest and anticipation in nondrug treatment options within this population. Among them, exercise has been recognized as a relatively safe and cost-effective treatment with minimal side effects and risks (6). Accumulating evidence from studies and clinical trials suggests that prescribed exercise regimens can reduce risk factors, decrease mortality, and improve quality of life (QoL) in patients with HF (7-10). Several meta-analyses have consistently shown exercise can provide significant prognostic benefits for HF patients (11,12). An optimal exercise prescription can mitigate left ventricular remodelling, increase exercise tolerance and QoL, and decrease mortality and rehospitalization rates in HF patients and this approach has been internationally recognized as a first-level recommendation for HF management (13). Although the benefits of exercise training for HF patients are well documented, there is no universal consensus on the optimal exercise prescription. A “one-size-fits-all” approach to exercise training is not appropriate for HF patients (14). It is crucial to tailor exercise recommendations on the basis of the specific type of HF and individual patient characteristics, including functional status and QoL (15). In this study, pairwise comparisons and network meta-analyses (NMAs) were conducted to evaluate different exercise regimens. We objectively assessed the impact of various exercise types on HF patients using multiple comprehensive indicators. Furthermore, we compared the responsiveness and efficacy of different exercise regimens across HF patients on the basis of their individual characteristics, such as age and ejection fraction. Our study aims to establish targeted and personalized exercise prescriptions for different HF patients, providing evidence-based recommendations to address significant clinical challenges in HF management. We present this article in accordance with the PRISMA-NMA reporting checklist (available at https://cdt.amegroups.com/article/view/10.21037/cdt-2024-698/rc).MethodsProtocol and guidanceThe protocol for this review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42022346011).Search strategy and inclusion criteriaThe systematic search was performed in PubMed (Medline), the Cochrane Library and Web of Science between 2000 and October 2023 using a combination of relevant Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms and text words, including exercise, physical activity, HF and treatment, with the Boolean search terms ‘OR’ and ‘AND’. No search filters or limits were applied. The following search terms were used: (heart failure) AND((treatment) OR(treat) OR(prognosis)) AND((motion) OR(sports) OR(exercise) OR(rehabilitation) OR(running) OR(walking) OR(training) OR(HIIT) OR(aerobic) OR(dance)).❖ PubMed: 26,544;❖ Science of the Web: 19,404;❖ Cochrane Library: 5,680.Two reviewers (Y.T.L. and C.J.D.) scanned titles and abstracts independently to determine article eligibility. If there was a contradiction in the study inclusion and exclusion criteria, the results were determined by a third person (X.Y.). All the articles with strict randomized controlled trial (RCT) designs were included. All duplicate records and some special types of research, such as conference proceedings, guidelines etc. were removed and the search was restricted to English language studies of humans. Full text reports were subsequently obtained and screened to ensure that they met predefined eligibility criteria: studies reporting well-defined or accessible exposures and presenting clear data. All participants in the studies had been diagnosed with HF and completed a minimum of 4 weeks of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR). This process is depicted in Figure 1. Authors of research manuscripts were contacted when the full text was not available or information needed for analysis was unavailable.Figure 1Flowchart of the review process of potential papers. RCT, randomized controlled trial.Data extractionTwo investigators (Y.T.L. and H.Y.Y.) independently extracted the related data from the included studies using a custom-made data extraction form. The following baseline characteristics for the study populations were collected: first author’s name and year of publication, sex and population included, age at baseline, New York Heart Association (NYHA) grading and LVEF at baseline, mean and standard deviation (SD) of pre- and postintervention indicators (peak VO2, 6MWT, max_workload, LVEF, peak HR, MLHFQ score), movement type, pattern and total duration of CR. According to Chapter 6 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (16), the change in SD was computed using standard errors, 95% confidence intervals (CIs), P values, or t statistics if they were available.Risk of bias and quality of researchTwo review authors (F.L.Y. and H.Y.Y.) independently evaluated the methodological quality of each included study in accordance with the relevant criteria (17). A risk of bias table was constructed for each study, and incorporated the description and judgement (low, high or unclear risk of bias) for each of the seven types of potential bias. Studies with three or more items of high or unclear risk of bias were regarded as having low methodological quality. We summarize the risk of bias in Table S1.CR, group classification and outcomesDefinition of the control group and exercise typeThe control group included people who routinely used HF medications but did not receive exercise interventions and patients with HF who were sedentary or who only received health education and exercise advice. For the experimental group, the classification of exercise types was based on the description of exercise prescriptions in the original article, including the type, time, intensity, and frequency of exercise. The exercise classification and specific exercise prescriptions for each study are detailed in Table S2. On the basis of one form of gross movement, we distinguish 5 types of movement: ‘aerobic training’ (AT), ‘combined training’ (CT), ‘high-intensity interval training’ (HIIT), ’strength training’ (ST) and ‘inspiratory muscle training’ (IMT). Each category was then further explored for appropriate subgroups, allowing for the analysis of walking, running, cycling, and combining aerobic and other aerobic agents (Baduanjin, Tai Chi, dance) as aerobic exercise training (AET) subgroups; AT + ST, AT + IMT, ST + IMT, and ST + HIIT were further categorized in the CT group.Definition of outcomeTo evaluate the effects of different exercises systematically and comprehensively, we selected the following six indicators for comparison: ‘left ventricular ejection fraction’ (LVEF) (%), ’six-minute walk test’ (6MWT) (m), ‘the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire’ (MLHFQ) (score), ‘peak oxygen uptake’ (peak VO2) (mL/kg/min), ‘maximum heart rate’ (MHR) (beats/min) and ‘max workload’ (W).The above six indicators can be used to comprehensively measure a patient’s cardiopulmonary function, exercise capacity, and QoL. The degree of improvement in the index can predict the prognosis of a patient to a certain extent. We carefully reviewed the measures used in the included articles to determine that there were no large differences in outcomes.OthersWe performed a series of grouping and analyses on the basis of the patient’s baseline age, LVEF, and number of weeks of exercise. The duration of exercise was divided into short (<3 months), moderate (3–6 months) and long (>6 months) according to the number of weeks of exercise. The patients were divided into older (≥65 years) and younger (<65 years) groups. Patients with severely reduced ejection fraction (<30%), generally reduced ejection fraction (30–40%), and preserved ejection fraction (>40%) were categorized on the basis of baseline LVEF.Statistical analysisPairwise meta-analysesA pairwise meta-analysis was performed to analyse the data. The heterogeneity, both clinical and methodological, was evaluated by scrutinizing the baseline characteristics of the patients, the methodologies employed, the interventions implemented, and the outcomes reported within the studies. The weighted mean difference (WMD) and the standardized mean difference (SMD) were ascertained for our results, each accompanied by a 95% CI. The SMD is a relative indicator that is not affected by baseline risk and has good consistency. We used the results of the SMD as the primary outcome for all indicators. In addition, since WMD is a true reflection of the experimental effect and is easy to understand when applied, we also used WMD as the result, especially in the subgroup analysis of training duration and the subgroup analysis of training and outcome sections. Furthermore, we evaluated the I2 statistic to assess the statistical heterogeneity present among the studies. If the I2 value exceeds 50%, it indicates the presence of significant heterogeneity. When statistical heterogeneity was significant (P<0.10 or I2>50%), the random effects model was used. When statistical heterogeneity was not significant (P≥0.10 or I2≤50%), the fixed-effects model was selected.Network meta-analysis (NMA)NMAs were executed on the basis of primary categorizations of exercise modes. Subsequent analyses were performed using secondary subgroup categorizations. Network diagrams were generated to graphically represent the direct and indirect comparisons among the various exercise modes. Ranking probability analyses were conducted, with the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) values (18) being calculated for each exercise mode and submode. Furthermore, node splitting and inconsistency testing, which utilize STATASE 16 with the network pack, were employed to assess the consistency between direct and indirect evidence within the network.Publication bias analysis and sensitivity analysisFunnel plots were employed to detect publication bias within the incorporated literature and to perform bias analysis leveraging the obtained outcomes. To ascertain the robustness of the study’s findings, a sensitivity analysis of the primary outcomes was conducted, especially for analyses with high heterogeneity.Subgroup analysisSubgroup analysis was implemented to discern potential sources of variation and heterogeneity across variables. We performed subgroup analyses on the basis of patient characteristics and exercise characteristics, including patient age, LVEF, specific exercise type, and duration of exercise.ResultsLiterature search and study characteristicsThe titles and abstracts of 51,628 articles were screened. Most of them were excluded because they were irrelevant or did not meet the inclusion criteria. After the full texts of the 568 remaining articles were evaluated, 30 studies were excluded for incomplete data, 243 studies were excluded for inappropriate and unclear exercise reports, 75 studies were excluded for non-HF participants and 98 studies were excluded for no relevant outcomes. Finally, 122 studies were included. The reference of these studies is shown in Additional Reference. The detailed process of study inclusion or exclusion is shown in Figure 1. The analysis involved 122 effect sizes, including 111 two-arm studies and 11 multiarm trials. Categorizing by type of training, 81 studies reported AT [36 bicycle, 10 walking, 7 running, 26 combined aerobic training (CAT), 3 other aerobic training (OAT)], 38 studies reported CT (30 AT + ST, 4 AT + IMT, 2 ST + IMT, 2 ST + HIIT), 30 studies reported HIIT, and 4 studies reported ST and IMT. Characteristics and original data of all 122 trials are presented in Tables S2,S3. Most of the studies involved both men and women and were conducted in North America and Europe.Sensitivity analysis and publication bias analysisPublication bias analysis are presented in Figure S1A-S1F, which showed some publication bias among the studies. Most funnel charts are symmetrical and there were some pairwise comparisons with fewer than 10 studies, and the results should be treated with caution. Sensitivity analysis showed that nearly all analyses were stable, except for LVEF in ST and MHR in CT in pairwise analysis (due to only 4 studies included).Pairwise analysesFigure 2 displays the overall outcome following each exercise mode compared with the control group. Peak VO2 intake can objectively reflect a patient’s cardiopulmonary function and can also predict the prognosis of a patient. We found that 3.91 mL/kg/min increased after HIIT (WMD: 3.91, 95% CI: 2.58 to 5.23, I2=84.3%, random) and that 2.49 mL/kg/min increased after AT (WMD: 2.49, 95% CI: 1.93 to 3.04, I2=93.2%, random). CT and ST can also increase peak oxygen uptake in people with HF. CT led to a 2.99 mL/kg/min improvement (WMD: 2.99, 95% CI: 1.89 to 4.10, I2=90.1%, random), and ST led to a 1.84 mL/kg/min improvement (WMD: 1.84, 95% CI: 0.16 to 3.51, I2=74.7%, random).Figure 2Pairwise analysis of training and outcome (SMD). 6MWT, six-minute walk test; CI, confidence interval; HIIT, high-intensity interval training; LVEF, left ventricular ejection fraction; MHR, maximum heart rate; MLHFQ, Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire; SMD, standardized mean difference.For other outcome, HIIT showed a 6.68% improvement in LVEF after training (WMD: 6.68, 95% CI: 0.57 to 12.80, I2=88.5%, random), with an overall increase of 2.97% in AT (WMD: 2.97, 95% CI: 1.00 to 4.93, I2=93.3%, random). In addition, patients who performed HIIT had an average 65.3 m increase in the 6MWT distance (WMD: 65.30, 95% CI: 40.16 to 90.45, I2=0, fix), and those who performed CT with AT had 49.02 m (WMD: 49.02, 95% CI: 1.91 to 96.12, I2=78.4%, random) increases compared to controls. As for MLHFQ score, HIIT exercise was able to reduce the MLHFQ score by 10.34 (WMD: −10.34, 95% CI: −15.50 to −5.18; I2=84.7%, random), and aerobic exercise combined exercise improved the QoL of patients with HF to varying degrees (WMD: −7.52, 95% CI: −12.09 to −2.95; I2=95.8%, random) and CT (WMD: −7.26, 95% CI: −11.55 to −2.97; I2: 67.8%, random). Furthermore, HIIT (WMD: 5.65, 95% CI: 2.39 to 8.91, I2=0, fix) and AT (WMD: 6.72, 95% CI: 3.50 to 9.94, I2=67.7%, random) can significantly increase the MHR during training, but CT was not significantly different. Finally, HIIT AT and CT reported that direct comparisons of exercises improved the patient’s external maximum work power: The specific analysis results of WMD and SMD are shown in Table S4 and the detailed studies included in the analysis can be seen in Table S5.Subgroup analysis of training duration and effectsTable S6 shows as the duration of CR increased, the results improved, especially for 6MWT (WMD <3 months: 16.8, 95% CI: −2.37 to 35.96, I2=69.6%, random; WMD ≥3 months: 53.76, 95% CI: 29.33 to 78.19, I2=84.5%, random), peak VO2 (WMD <3 months: 1.82, 95% CI: 0.87 to 2.78, I2=89.9%, random; WMD >6 months: 4.07, 95% CI: 3.20 to 4.94, I2=88.6%, random), LVEF (WMD <3 months: 1.57, 95% CI: −2.99 to 6.14, I2=95.9%, random; WMD >6 months: 4.83, 95% CI: 1.99 to 7.67, I2=85%, random) and the MLHFQ score (WMD <3 months: −6.53, 95% CI: −11.04 to −2.03, I2=70.1%, random; WMD >6 months: −11.95, 95% CI: −19.06 to −4.83, I2=94.3%, random) in AT.Subgroup analysis of exercise modes and effectsAmong the multiple exercise subgroup types, the aerobic exercise group performed best, especially cycling and combined aerobic exercise (Table S7). Bicycles significantly improved various metrics, such as peak VO2, MHR, the MLHFQ score and Max_workload. Walking and running also significantly increased peak VO2 capacity. For some indicators, such as Max_workload, aerobic + ST also significantly improved the indicators (WMD: 15.48, 95% CI: 7.47 to 23.48).NMAsFigure 3A,3B depict the primary and secondary training network diagrams for the peak VO2 outcome. Network diagrams for other outcomes are shown in Figure S2A-S2E.Figure 3Network diagrams depicting the direct and indirect comparisons for the network meta-analyses.

HIIT, high-intensity interval training; IMT, inspiratory muscle training.The comparison results of primary training can be clearly seen in Figure 4, and the Bayesian table of rank probabilities and surface under the cumulative ranking of primary training is shown in Table S8. Similar to the aforementioned pairwise meta-analysis, aerobic exercise and HIIT have been shown to be better in HF patients than other types of exercise. HIIT was significantly more effective at improving peak VO2 than was CT (SMD: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.06 to 1.30); HIIT (SMD: 1.46, 95% CI: 0.33 to 2.60) and AT (SMD: 1.20, 95% CI: 0.28 to 2.13) were significantly more effective at improving the peak VO2 than was ST. There were no other significant differences between the primary exercise modes for any of the outcomes.Figure 4Network meta-analysis for different training and outcome (SMD).

Figure 7 shows the overall NMA for the peak VO2 in subgroup training modes. Cycling (SMD: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.08 to 1.40) and HIIT (SMD: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.20 to 1.55) were significantly more effective than ST + AT. There were no other significant peak VO2 differences between the subgroup training modes.Figure 6The Bayesian ranking panel plots for training and peak VO2 in subgroup exercise mode.

In terms of baseline LVEF, although most of the results were not statistically significant, we found that patients with a lower ejection fraction had better responsiveness to exercise, particularly in terms of the Max_workload outcome of aerobic exercise (LVEF <30%, SMD: 2.18, 95% CI: 0.36 to 4.00; LVEF >40%, SMD: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.41 to 1.24). Seen in Table S12.Inconsistency analysis for NMAWe tested for inconsistency across the outcomes of each primary (Table S13) and secondary exercise (Table S14) intervention. In the global and local inconsistency test, none of the training analyses showed clear consistency (P>0.05). Loop inconsistency analysis shows only control-CT-ST rings of the Max_workload in the original exercise (P=0.04) exist inconsistencies.DiscussionInconsistent with the prevailing view that engaging in physical activity can drastically enhance heart health and improve survival and prognosis (19). In our study, we found that exercise rehabilitation can provide varying degrees of benefit to patients with HF, especially HIIT benefits most.HIIT is a highly effective exercise mode. By alternating short periods of high-intensity exercise with short periods of rest or low-intensity exercise, HIIT can significantly increase maximal oxygen uptake, enhance myocardial contractility, reduce resting heart rate, and enhance cardiopulmonary function (20,21). HIIT can also reduce body fat (22), enhance muscle strength and endurance (23), significantly reduce anxiety and depressive symptoms (24), increase bone mineral density, and improve bone metabolism (25). Several studies have also found that HIIT can also improve glycemic control, reduce lipid levels, and improve insulin sensitivity (26). These benefits make HIIT an ideal exercise option for people of different age groups and fitness levels. Long-term adherence to HIIT can not only effectively improve the level of physical health, but also help to prevent and treat a variety of chronic diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, etc. (20,22,26,27). Although studies have systematically discussed the safety of HIIT (28,29), and exercise-related adverse events were not reported the studies we included, we found that this mode of exercise was widely used only in patients with NYHA II–III, and few articles investigated the safety of HIIT alone in patients with NYHA IV. The vast majority of the articles provided only a general description of the patient’s NYHA grade rather than a strict stratification. However, HIIT has a greater intensity than other types of exercise. Therefore, considering the diversity and complexity of HF patients, it is necessary to conduct more extensive research on the safety of HIIT, particularly for patients with advanced HF or comorbidities.Our analysis also revealed that aerobic workouts can significantly improve symptoms, cardiorespiratory function, and QoL in people with HF. As the main method used in heart rehabilitation training, aerobic exercise is intimately linked to athletic characteristics and benefits. Aerobic workouts can offer measurable elements to enhance heart performance (such as peak VO2) (30), and increase endothelial health by increasing mitochondrial oxygen absorption and use (31). Due to their broad scope, practicality, and operability in real-world clinical rehabilitation training which ensure patients’ acceptance and adherence, aerobic workouts did a really good job in improving HF. Beside, some other sports such as ST (resistance training) , respiratory muscle training and respiratory muscle training also can improved clinical parameters in patients with HF (32-34) and showed a clear advantage, however due to the limited studies included, the benefit evidences were not significant in our analysis.Last but not least, we found that participants under the age of 65 years may have had better responsiveness to exercise training, with more significant improvements in various outcomes, such as the 6MWT, MLHFQ score and Max_workload, which means the effective values varied across different populations. Research findings indicate that older patients face specific challenges in both the psychological executive ability of active participation in sports prognosis and the ability to engage in physical activity in practice (35). More refined and personalized indicators need to be used to more accurately evaluate the characteristics and advantages of these exercises in the future.LimitationsThis study has several limitations that should be acknowledged. First, a certain degree of publication bias existed due to the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the literature. Second, inadequate monitoring of the control group’s activities, a lack of reports of exercise safety and adverse effects, poor participant and investigator awareness of group allocation and baseline data for participants, strategies for exercise rehabilitation, timing, and assessment methods for each outcome varied widely across studies. Additionally, it was difficult to draw convincing evidence and conclusions for some exercise modes because of limited sample sizes. It is imperative that we incorporate a multitude of pertinent factors in our future endeavors and conduct comprehensive, large-sample, multicentre RCTs to examine the safety and impact of exercise rehabilitation training on individuals suffering from HF.ConclusionsIn this study, we reported that various exercise types, especially HIIT, can improve QoL, cardiac function, LVEF, and exercise tolerance in patients with HF. The results of this analysis should inform future exercise guideline personalized recommendations and prescriptions for HF patients.SupplementaryThe article’s supplementary files as10.21037/cdt-2024-69810.21037/cdt-2024-69810.21037/cdt-2024-698"}
{"PMCID": "12091660", "title": "Association between circulating inflammatory proteins and gout: A Mendelian randomization study", "abstract": "Clinical studies have consistently demonstrated that inflammation is a critical factor in the pathophysiology and progression of gout. This study aims to explore the causal relationship between CIPs and gout, utilizing MR in conjunction with meta-analyses. We utilized genetic data pertaining to gout from the GWAS which involved 3576 cases and 147,221 control participants. A total of 132 CIPs were extracted from the GWAS data to identify SNPs associated with gout. The primary analytical approach was the IVW method. Sensitivity analyses indicated no pleiotropy or heterogeneity. The IVW results revealed that several CIPs were associated with gout in European populations. The analysis results indicate that FGF-21, MMP-1, G-CSF, and IFN-γ are involved in the pathogenesis of gout, and gout may influence the expression of CXCL1, IL-1Ra, and TNF-α. Consequently, targeted research focusing on specific CIPs could provide a promising strategy for the treatment and prevention of gout, offering potential therapeutic targets for the underlying inflammatory mechanisms of the disease.", "body": "1. IntroductionGout is a disorder characterized by inflammation of the joints due to elevated levels of uric acid in the body. This disorder results from dysregulation in purine metabolism, leading to the accumulation of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals within and around the articular structures. The deposition of these crystals triggers an inflammatory response, ultimately resulting in gouty arthritis.[1] Recent evidence has increasingly highlighted the central role of chronic inflammation in the pathogenesis of gout. Over the past 2 decades, significant progress has been made in understanding the innate immune mechanisms that drive gouty inflammation. The gold standard for diagnosing gout remains the identification of MSU crystals in gouty tophi via microscopy.[2]It has been well established that the deposition of MSU crystals in the joints triggers the activation of immune cells, including macrophages, neutrophils, and monocytes. These cells release a range of circulating inflammatory proteins (CIPs), such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-18 (IL-18), which initiate and amplify the inflammatory cascade that underpins the pathogenesis of gout.[3,4] Among these, the interleukin-1(IL-1) family of cytokines is particularly critical, playing a pivotal role in both innate immunity and the regulation of inflammatory processes. IL-1 family members mediate immune responses through diverse mechanisms, including the processing and secretion of precursor proteins, modulation of gene expression, and interaction with specific receptors.[5] The IL-1 family consists of 13 members, including IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-18, all of which are involved in the inflammatory response associated with gout. Furthermore, TNF-α is another key pro-inflammatory cytokine that contributes significantly to the exacerbation of gout attacks. Collectively, these inflammatory mediators intensify both the inflammatory response and the pain associated with gout through complex signaling pathways and cell-to-cell interactions. A deeper understanding of the mechanisms by which these inflammatory factors exert their effects is crucial for the development of novel therapeutic strategies, such as the use of IL-1β antagonists (e.g., anakinra) to mitigate the symptoms of gout.[6] However, research on the role of other CIPs in gout remains limited. Moreover, establishing causal relationships between specific cytokines and gout is challenging, owing to the confounding factors and reverse causality inherent in clinical and observational studies.[7]Mendelian Randomization (MR) is a research methodology that leverages genetic variation as instrumental variables (IVs) to assess causal relationships between risk factors and specific diseases.[8] In MR analysis, genetic variation adheres to the principle of random allele distribution during meiosis, akin to the randomization process in controlled trials. Consequently, this approach mitigates several limitations inherent in observational studies, such as confounding, reverse causality, and selection bias, while also circumventing the logistical constraints of randomized controlled trials. Previous studies have demonstrated that genetic variation in individuals can influence the incidence, progression, and clinical outcomes of gout, with identified genetic polymorphisms potentially modulating both the risk and severity of the disease. To date, MR has not been applied to explore the causal relationship between CIPs and gout.In this study, we employ two-sample MR analysis to investigate the causal relationships between multiple CIPs and the development of gout, and integrate data from Genome-wide Association Study (GWAS) with MR analysis to investigate the causal associations between various CIPs and the risk of gout. The aim of this study is to clarify the role of CIPs in gout pathogenesis and to establish a theoretical framework for future research on potential pharmacological targets for gout, which is of considerable clinical significance.2. Materials and methods2.1. Ethics statementOur study involved human participants’ data which are from the IEU open GWAS project and the EBI GWAS Catalog project (obtained date: October 07, 2024). The data from these 2 projects are publicly available. Ethical approval was not necessary for our study.2.2. Study designMR is based on 3 fundamental assumptions: relevance: the IVs used in the study must be strongly associated with the exposure factor; independence: the IVs must be independent of any confounding factors that could influence the exposure-outcome relationship; and exclusion restriction: the exposure factor should be the sole pathway through which the IVs affect the outcome.[9] To comprehensively identify CIPs associated with gout, this study conducted an extensive screening of GWAS data, resulting in a dataset comprising 41 previously published CIPs and 91 newly identified CIPs.[10]To further explore the causal relationship between CIPs and gout, we performed a bidirectional MR analysis. In the forward MR analysis, CIPs were treated as exposure factors, with gout as the outcome variable, to assess the causal link between CIPs and gout. In the reverse MR analysis, gout was considered as the exposure factor and CIPs as the outcome variable, enabling the investigation of the potential causal influence of gout on CIPs, as illustrated in Figure 1.Figure 1.Bidirectional MR research flowchart for CIPs and gout. This figure elucidates the 3 foundational assumptions of MR: (1) Relevance: SNPs robustly associated with exposure, independence, and exclusion restriction; (2) Independence: SNPs not associated with confounders; (3) Exclusion restriction: SNPs only associated with outcome through exposure. CIPs = circulating inflammatory proteins, IVs = instrumental variables, SNPs = single nucleotide polymorphisms, MR = Mendelian randomization.2.3. Data sourceThe GWAS data for 91 CIPs were obtained from 14,824 participants of European ancestry across 11 independent cohorts, and a genome-wide protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) analysis was performed for these 91 CIPs.[11] These data are available through the EBI GWAS Catalog project (IDs ranging from GCST90274758 to GCST90274848).The GWAS data for 41 inflammatory factors were derived from combined analyses of 3 independent cohorts, comprising a total of 8293 Finnish participants.[12] These data can be accessed via the MRC IEU open GWAS project (IDs ebi-a-GCST004420 to ebi-a-GCST004460).Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with gout were extracted from the FinnGen database, which includes 3576 European cases and 147,221 controls. This dataset is also available for download from the IEU open GWAS project (ID finn-b-M13_GOUT). Since the data used in this study are publicly available from GWAS databases, ethical approval and informed consent were not required.2.4. Selection of IVsTo satisfy the first MR assumption regarding the strong association between SNPs and cytokines, it is crucial to select SNPs that are significantly associated with CIPs at the genome-wide level (P < 5 × 10⁻⁸). However, it is important to acknowledge the limitations of using this stringent threshold for SNP selection in certain human phenotypes. In the context of this bidirectional MR analysis, we encountered such limitations when applying the P < 5 × 10⁻⁸ threshold. To obtain more robust IVs, we relaxed the genome-wide significance threshold and set the SNP inclusion criterion to P < 5 × 10⁻⁶.[13] Relaxation of the genome-wide significance threshold followed previously validated approaches for MR analyses with limited instrument strength.[13–20] To minimize the influence of linkage disequilibrium (LD) on our results, we implemented a two-stage LD pruning and clumping procedure based on established methodologies.[7,14,21–24] First, genome-wide LD pruning was performed using PLINK v1.9 “indep-pairwise” function[21] with a 10,000 kb sliding window and stringent r² threshold of 0.001. This approach, recommended by Purcell et al for capturing long-range LD regions,[21] effectively removed redundant SNPs within the exposure dataset.The selected parameters (10,000 kb window; r2 < 0.001) were validated by Burgess et al as optimal thresholds for ensuring SNP independence in Mendelian randomization studies.[7,23] To estimate the proportion of variance explained by each SNP for the exposure variable (i.e., the R2 value), the following formulas were applied:R2=2×EAF×(1−EAF)×beta2(2×EAF×(1−EAF)×beta2)+(2×EAF×(1−EAF)×N×SE(beta)2); F=R2(N−2)1−R2The two formulas provided involve the effect allele frequency (EAF), where 1 − EAF represents the frequency of the non-effect allele, N denotes the sample size for the exposure variable, beta refers to the estimated genetic effect, and SE represents the standard error of the genetic effect. These formulas quantify the degree to which each SNP accounts for the variability in the exposure variable, with a higher R2 value indicating a stronger explanatory power of the SNP for the exposure. In MR, selecting SNPs with higher R2 values as instrumental variables typically enhances both the statistical power and the reliability of the analysis. To assess the strength of genetic instrumental variables in MR, a higher F-statistic suggests a stronger SNP instrument, with a threshold value of 10 or greater considered indicative of a robust instrument.[25]To further ensure the validity of IVs, we performed rigorous quality control steps to exclude pleiotropic and weak instruments: Pleiotropy removal: SNPs showing significant associations (P < 1 × 10⁻⁵) with potential confounders were identified via PhenoScanner V2 and excluded. Horizontal pleiotropy was assessed using MR-Egger intercept test (P > .05) and MR-PRESSO global test (P > .05). Outlier SNPs detected by MR-PRESSO were iteratively removed. Weak instrument filtering: All retained SNPs had F statistics > 10. SNPs with F < 10 were excluded. Heterogeneity checks: Cochran’s Q test indicated no significant heterogeneity among SNPs. Sensitivity analyses using leave-one-out method confirmed no single SNP drove the causal effect.In this study, we assume that the selected genetic instruments satisfy the independence assumption, meaning that these instruments are not associated with any known or unknown confounders in the study. In other words, the variation in the instruments affects the outcome variable only through the exposure variable, and not through other potential confounding factors. To validate this assumption, we conducted a series of sensitivity analyses and ruled out factors that may affect the independence of the instruments.2.5. Statistical analysisThis study employed bidirectional MR to assess causal relationships, utilizing the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method, which was widely regarded as the most effective approach in MR due to its high statistical power. Supplementary analyses were performed using the MR Egger, Weighted Median, Simple Mode, and Weighted Mode methods.[26] The odds ratio (OR) and its corresponding 95% CI derived from the bidirectional MR analysis were used to evaluate the causal effect of the exposure on the outcome. Various visualization tools, including forest plots, scatter plots, and funnel plots, were employed to present the results. Additionally, a circular heatmap was generated by combining P values from the 5 MR methods with the OR from the IVW method.To evaluate the stability and reliability of the MR results, this study conducted multiple sensitivity analyses employing various methods. MR-Egger was used to assess and adjust for the potential influence of horizontal pleiotropy. A significant non-zero intercept in MR-Egger suggests the presence of interference from other factors on the effect of the instrumental variable on the outcome. By estimating the intercept, more reliable causal estimates can be obtained in the presence of pleiotropy, thereby reducing bias induced by pleiotropy.[27] MR-PRESSO evaluates residuals and outliers of the instrumental variables to identify potential pleiotropic effects. If abnormal instrumental variables are identified, removing these outliers and applying corrections ensures more robust results.[28] Additionally, a leave-one-out analysis was performed to assess the potential influence of individual SNPs on the MR estimates, thereby enhancing the reliability and stability of the results.[29] To assess heterogeneity, Cochran’s Q tests were conducted for both the IVW and MR-Egger methods. A P value below .05 indicates the presence of heterogeneity, which is assessed using a random-effects model, while a P value of .05 or greater is evaluated with a fixed-effects model.[30] To reduce the probability of erroneously rejecting the null hypothesis due to multiple testing, Bonferroni correction was applied by dividing the original significance threshold by the number of independent tests. Therefore, a P value of less than 3.79 × 10−4 (0.05/132) indicates a significant association, whereas P values between 3.79 × 10−4 and 0.05 suggests a suggestive association.[31] Furthermore, a meta-analysis was conducted on the results from the same CIPs across 2 datasets.[32] Statistical analyses were performed using R software (version 4.4.0), with the following packages: TwoSampleMR, MendelianRandomization, circlize, ComplexHeatmap, tidyverse, ggpubr, and MRPRESSO.2.6. Statistical power calculationsTo evaluate the reliability of causal inferences, we performed statistical power calculations for all inflammatory factors included in the bidirectional MR analysis. Following the methodology of Burgess,[7] we estimated power based on the following parameters: Instrument strength: Genetic instruments were restricted to SNPs with F-statistics > 10 to minimize weak instrument bias; Effect size range: We assumed OR from 1.1 to 1.5 for the exposure-outcome relationship; and Sample size: The sample sizes of both exposure and outcome GWAS datasets were incorporated into the power formula. Full results of these calculations are provided in Table S7, Supplemental Digital Content, https://links.lww.com/MD/O842 and Figure S7, Supplemental Digital Content, https://links.lww.com/MD/O843.3. ResultsThe study incorporated a total of 133 GWASs, including 132 for CIPs and one for gout (Table S1, Supplemental Digital Content, https://links.lww.com/MD/O842). The F-statistics for all instrumental variables were greater than 10, demonstrating the robustness of the selected SNPs (Table S2, Supplemental Digital Content, https://links.lww.com/MD/O842).3.1. Causal effects of CIPs on goutIn the IVW analysis of forward MR, 5 CIPs were suggestively and positively associated with gout, including fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF-21) (OR = 1.203; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.002–1.445; P = .048), matrix metalloproteinases-1 (MMP-1) (OR = 1.248; 95% CI: 1.061–1.468; P = .008), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) (OR = 1.234; 95% CI: 1.012–1.506; P = .038), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) (OR = 1.295; 95% CI: 1.026–1.634; P = .029), and transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-α) (OR = 1.305; 95% CI: 1.020–1.669; P = .034) (Fig. 2). The forest plot results from the IVW and MR-Egger analyses for these 5 CIPs are presented in Figure S1, Supplemental Digital Content, https://links.lww.com/MD/O843. Scatter plots suggested a positive correlation between these 5 CIPs and gout (Fig. 3). Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons indicated that the association between these 5 CIPs and gout was positive (3.79 × 10−4 < P < .05). The “leave-one-out” analysis confirmed the robustness of the MR findings (Figure S2, Supplemental Digital Content, https://links.lww.com/MD/O843). The forest plot for the 132 CIPs using the IVW method in the forward MR analysis is shown in Figure S3, Supplemental Digital Content, https://links.lww.com/MD/O843, and the heatmap showing the 132 CIPs as exposures and gout as the outcome is presented in Figure 4.The results of the causal relationship between 132 CIPS and gout in the forward MR analysis are presented in Table S3, Supplemental Digital Content, https://links.lww.com/MD/O842.Figure 2.The positive results of the forward MR analysis conducted with the Inverse variance weighted, MR-Egger, Weighted median, Simple mode, and Weighted mode method.

IVW = Inverse variance weighted.The MR-Egger intercept analysis revealed no evidence of horizontal pleiotropy for FGF-21, MMP-1, G-CSF, and IFN-γ, with intercepts of FGF-21 (intercept = −0.040, P = .106), MMP-1 (intercept = 0.01, P = .551), G-CSF (intercept = −0.005, P = .964), and IFN-γ (intercept = 0.034, P = .291). However, horizontal pleiotropy was observed for TGF-α (intercept = 0.073, P = .017). MR-PRESSO results indicated no significant heterogeneity for these 5 CIPs, with FGF-21 (RSSobs = 11.414, P = .66), MMP-1 (RSSobs = 13.968, P = .685), G-CSF (RSSobs = 5.515, P = .784), IFN-γ (RSSobs = 10.58, P = .343), and TGF-α (RSSobs = 18.47, P = .2) (Table 1). Although the P value for TGF-α in MR-PRESSO was greater than .05, indicating no significant instrumental variable outliers or heterogeneity caused by outliers, the MR-Egger intercept analysis detected significant horizontal pleiotropy, suggesting that TGF-α may influence the outcome through pathways unrelated to the exposure. The use of uncorrected effect estimates could lead to bias.[7] Therefore, TGF-α was considered to exhibit significant pleiotropy and was excluded from the forward results of the IVW analysis. All Cochran’s Q test P values were greater than .05, indicating no heterogeneity; thus, all analyses were conducted using a fixed-effects model (Table 1).Table 1Heterogeneity test, pleiotropy test, and MR-PRESSO results for positive CIPs and gout in forward and reverse MRExposureOutcomeHeterogeneity testPleiotropy testMR-PRESSOMethodQQ_dfQ_P valueEgger interceptSEP valueGlobal test RSSobsGlobal test P valueFGF21GoutMR Egger6.47311.84−0.040.023.10611.414.66IVW9.5712.654MMP-1GoutMR Egger12.43223.7790.010.017.55113.968.685IVW12.80524.702G-CSFGoutMR Egger3.09420.116−0.0050.09.9645.515.784IVW4.39721.088IFN-γGoutMR Egger6.8376.3360.0340.03.29110.58.343IVW8.3657.302TGF-αGoutMR Egger7.47210.6800.0730.026.01718.47.2IVW15.65511.154GoutCXCL1MR Egger20.17515.1650.0230.022.31324.296.183IVW21.64116.155GoutIL1-RaMR Egger12.69315.6260.040.018.04419.447.374IVW17.54116.352GoutTNF-αMR Egger11.64215.7060.0120.019.52313.508.762IVW12.0716.74CXCL1 = CXC motif chemokine ligand 1, FGF21 = Fibroblast Growth Factor 21, G-CSF = Granulocyt Colony-Stimulating, IFN-γ = Interferon-gamma, IL-1Ra = Interleukin 1 Receptor Antagonist, IVW = Inverse variance weighted, MMP-1 = Matrix metalloproteinase-1, MR = Mendelian randomization, TGF-α = Transforming Growth Factor Alpha, TNF-α = Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha Factor.3.2. Causal effects of gout on CIPsReverse MR analysis revealed a suggestive positive association between gout and CXC motif chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL1) (OR = 1.127; 95% CI: 1.014–1.253; P = .027), interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) (OR = 1.102; 95% CI: 1.004–1.210; P = .042), and TNF-α (OR = 1.124; 95% CI: 1.026–1.232; P = .012) (Fig. 5). Scatter plots suggested a positive correlation between these 3 CIPs and gout (Fig. 6). After Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, a suggestive association between gout and these 3 CIPs was confirmed (3.79 × 10−4 < P < .05). Figure S4, Supplemental Digital Content, https://links.lww.com/MD/O843 provides the forest plot of IVW and MR-Egger analysis results for these 3 CIPs. The “leave-one-out” analysis confirmed the robustness of the MR findings (Figure S5, Supplemental Digital Content, https://links.lww.com/MD/O843). Additionally, the forest plot for the 132 CIPs in the reverse MR analysis using the IVW method is shown in Figure S6, Supplemental Digital Content, https://links.lww.com/MD/O843.

IVW = Inverse variance weighted.MR-Egger intercept analysis showed no evidence of horizontal pleiotropy for CXCL1 (intercept = 0.023, P = .313), IL-1Ra (intercept = 0.04, P = .044), or TNF-α (intercept = 0.012, P = .523). MR-PRESSO results indicated no significant heterogeneity for these 3 CIPs: CXCL1 (RSSobs = 24.296, P = .183), IL-1Ra (RSSobs = 19.447, P = .374), and TNF-α (RSSobs = 13.508, P = .762). Cochran’s Q test P values were all greater than .05, indicating no heterogeneity, and thus, all analyses were conducted using a fixed-effects model (Table 1).3.3. Meta-analysisTo strengthen the robustness of the findings, a meta-analysis was conducted for 23 pairs of MR results derived from two distinct data sources: the IEU OpenGWAS and the EBI GWAS Catalog. The meta-analysis revealed that an elevated risk of gout was significantly associated with increased levels of CXC motif chemokine ligand 9 (CXCL9), also known as monokine induced by gamma interferon (MIG), with an OR of 1.12 (95% CI: 1.02–1.24; P = .020), based on the IVW method after combining the MR results from both datasets (Fig. 8). No significant correlation was observed between gout and other CIPs. Additionally, heterogeneity and sensitivity analyses revealed no noteworthy associations (Tables S5 and S6, Supplemental Digital Content, https://links.lww.com/MD/O842).Figure 8.Forest plot of the relationship between gout and CXCL1 based on meta-analysis results from the reverse MR analysis. CXCL1 = CXC motif chemokine ligand 1, MR = Mendelian randomization, nsnp = the number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms used in the analysis, OR = odds ratio.3.4. Power analysis of MR analysisWe performed comprehensive statistical power calculations for all CIPs, with detailed results provided in Table S7, Supplemental Digital Content, https://links.lww.com/MD/O842. Among the 7 CIPs demonstrating significant causal associations with gout after Bonferroni correction, all achieved 100% statistical power under the current sample size (Figure S7, Supplemental Digital Content, https://links.lww.com/MD/O843), indicating high robustness in prioritizing these factors as potential therapeutic targets.For non-significant associations, some CIPs exhibited insufficient statistical power (<80%), likely attributable to limited GWAS sample sizes for the corresponding exposures. Sensitivity analyses employing weighted median and MR-Egger regression revealed consistent directionality of effect estimates, suggesting no evidence of horizontal pleiotropy.4. DiscussionIn this study, bidirectional MR analysis was employed to investigate the association between CIPs and gout, with the aim of providing genetic evidence for a potential causal relationship between these biomarkers and gout risk. Our findings suggest that elevated levels of FGF21, MMP-1, G-CSF, and IFN-γ are positively correlated with the onset of gout, as indicated by the forward MR analysis. Furthermore, the reverse MR analysis suggests that elevated levels of CXCL1, IL-1Ra, and TNF-α may be a consequence of gout, with these associations remaining robust after sensitivity analysis. Additionally, a meta-analysis of 23 pairs of CIPs from 2 independent datasets identified an association between increased gout risk and elevated levels of CXCL9 (MIG). Notably, this inflammatory marker did not show a significant effect in the individual MR analyses, likely due to insufficient statistical power in the smaller datasets. However, the meta-analysis, which benefited from a larger sample size and greater statistical power, revealed a significant effect. Despite this, the meta-analysis in this study was based on a relatively small sample size, and as such, it may be susceptible to residual confounding and selection bias. Furthermore, funnel plots could not reliably assess publication bias, leaving open the possibility of false-positive results. Therefore, larger-scale, independent MR studies and randomized controlled trials are warranted in the future to further validate and clarify these findings.[7,33,34]CIPs contribute to the inflammatory process in gout, primarily through the activation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and the NOD-like receptor pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome by MSU crystals, which leads to the release of pro-inflammatory mediators. Initially, macrophages phagocytose MSU crystals and activate NADPH oxidase, resulting in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which in turn trigger innate immune responses via Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4).[35] Phagocytosis of MSU crystals further activates the NLRP3 inflammasome, which leads to the activation of caspase-1 and the subsequent generation of IL-1β. This cascade promotes the release of additional inflammatory mediators, including TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-8. These factors interact synergistically, facilitating the recruitment and activation of neutrophils, thereby exacerbating inflammation and ultimately resulting in the clinical manifestations of acute gout attacks, such as severe joint pain, swelling, and erythema.[36,37] The association of IL-1β, TNF-α IL-6, and IL-8 with gout has been well-established. However, the roles of other CIPs in the pathogenesis of gout remain to be fully elucidated, and effective treatments for acute gouty arthritis remain insufficient.[38,39] Consequently, investigating the involvement of CIPs in the inflammatory processes underlying gout is critical for the development of targeted interventions, potentially leading to novel therapeutic strategies for managing gout.The Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) family comprises structurally homologous polypeptides that orchestrate fundamental biological processes including cellular proliferation, differentiation, and metabolic homeostasis.[40,41] Of pathophysiological relevance, FGF21 has emerged as a pleiotropic metabolic modulator exhibiting context-dependent duality in gout pathogenesis. This endocrine effector, predominantly synthesized in hepatocytes and adipocytes, governs systemic glucose homeostasis, lipolysis, and insulin sensitivity through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα)-dependent mechanisms.[42,43] Genome-wide association studies implicate FGF21 as a candidate causal mediator in gout susceptibility, with a lead variant identified among 26 million participants.[44] Studies have also shown that FGF21 is involved in the regulation of uric acid metabolism, with its levels increasing in hyperuricemia.[45,46] Additional studies have confirmed that FGF21 signaling is associated with reduced uric acid levels and a decreased risk of gout, highlighting its potential as a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of gout.[47] Paradoxically, while preclinical models demonstrate FGF21’s capacity to attenuate hyperuricemia via dual suppression of NF-κB/NLRP3 inflammasome activation and TGF-1β/Smad3-driven renal fibrosis,[48–53] our bidirectional MR analysis reveals a positive causal association between elevated circulating FGF21 levels and incident gout risk. This discrepancy could reflect tissue-specific effects: experimental evidence indicates that FGF21 enhances mitochondrial function in hepatocytes but may exacerbate oxidative stress in macrophages during inflammatory responses to MSU crystals, potentially through redox-sensitive NLRP3 activation. Clinically, although phase II trials of FGF21 analogs (e.g., efruxifermin) demonstrate significant urate-lowering efficacy in metabolic syndrome cohorts,[46] our genetic evidence advocates for stratified intervention strategies. Prospective pharmacovigilance studies should evaluate whether concomitant administration of NLRP3 inhibitors (e.g., colchicine) or IL-1β-neutralizing biologics could mitigate FGF21-associated gout flare risk in predisposed individuals.MMP-1, a zinc-dependent collagenase, emerges as a pivotal mediator in gout pathogenesis through its dual capacity to degrade articular extracellular matrix (ECM) and amplify sterile inflammation.[54] Mechanistically, MSU crystals synergistically activate fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) via TLR4/NF-κB signaling, triggering MMP-1 overexpression that is further potentiated by IL-17-mediated stabilization of MMP-1 mRNA.[55–57] This protease cascade facilitates synovial invasion by promoting monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation through keratin-related protein KPT16 upregulation, while collagenolytic cleavage releases proline-glycine-proline (PGP) fragments that chemoattract neutrophils, thereby establishing a self-perpetuating cycle of joint destruction.[56,58] Clinically, our MR findings align with cohort studies demonstrating that synovial fluid MMP-1 levels correlate with ultrasound-defined bone erosion severity in gout,[59] positioning it as both a biomarker for early erosive changes and a therapeutic target. Translationally, selective MMP-1 inhibitors (e.g., AZD1236), currently in phase II trials for osteoarthritis, warrant evaluation in refractory gout patients with radiographically confirmed erosions, particularly when combined with IL-1β blockade to concurrently mitigate inflammasome activation and ECM degradation – a precision strategy that may halt structural progression in this clinically aggressive subtype.G-CSF, a 25 kDa glycoprotein encoded by the CSF3 gene, emerges as a pivotal orchestrator of neutrophilic inflammation in gout pathogenesis. Beyond its canonical role in granulopoiesis via Janus Kinase 2/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (JAK2/STAT3) signaling,[60] single-cell RNA sequencing reveals G-CSF’s metabolic reprogramming of neutrophils – enhancing PFKFB3-driven glycolysis to fuel neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation in response to MSU crystals.[61] This feedforward inflammatory loop is amplified by MSU-induced histone H3K27 acetylation at the CSF3 promoter in synovial macrophages, which synergizes with IL-1β to upregulate G-CSF production by 12-fold compared to controls.[62]Clinically, emerging evidence suggests that elevated levels of certain inflammation-associated biomarkers may correlate with therapeutic response in acute gout flares, and their detection may inform the selection of clinical intervention strategies. In the context of inflammatory pathway modulation, targeted therapeutic agents affecting key cytokine-mediated cascades demonstrate potential in regulating neutrophil activity. Furthermore, combination strategies targeting multiple inflammatory pathways are hypothesized to ameliorate pathological progression in complex cases. It should be emphasized that these mechanistic hypotheses and clinical observations require further validation through rigorously designed large-scale studies.IFN-γ, a pleiotropic cytokine secreted by activated T cells and NK cells, drives gout pathogenesis through dual metabolic-inflammatory mechanisms.[63–65] First, IFN-γ induces hepatic xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) expression via STAT1-mediated transcriptional activation, accelerating purine catabolism and uric acid overproduction.[63,64] Second, it synergizes with MSU crystals to potentiate NLRP3 inflammasome assembly in macrophages, amplifying IL-1β/IL-18-dependent synovitis.[65] Clinically, serum IFN-γ levels correlate with hyperuricemia severity and predict corticosteroid resistance in acute flares, positioning it as a theranostic biomarker.[65] Notably, while circulating mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are depleted in gout patients, residual populations maintain robust IFN-γ/IL-17 production, perpetuating tissue inflammation.[66] Therapeutic breakthroughs emerge from targeting this axis: Sirt1 agonists suppress IFN-γ-induced CXCL1/MCP-1 chemokine storms while normalizing uricemia.[67] and JAK inhibitors (e.g., baricitinib) blunt IFN-γ signaling through STAT3 blockade.[68] In the present study, we also found that elevated levels of IFN-γ may increase the risk of gout, Our findings redefine gout as a metabolic-immunological interface disorder, advocating combined urate-lowering and pathway-specific immunomodulation to address refractory cases.CXCL1 orchestrates neutrophil-dominated inflammation in gout through feedforward loops with NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Mechanistically, IL-1β-induced CXCL1 secretion recruits neutrophils via CXCR2 binding, while deposited MSU crystals synergistically enhance NF-κB-mediated CXCL1 transcription and NLRP3/ASC/pro-caspase-1 assembly, creating self-perpetuating inflammation.[69,70] Clinically, synovial CXCL1 levels correlate with acute flare severity and predict colchicine resistance, positioning it as a theranostic biomarker for stratified therapy.[71] Quratein D, a CXCL1-neutralizing biologic, suppressing IL-1β/CXCL1 cross-activation in synovium.[72] Lifestyle intervention via moderate-intensity exercise downregulates CXCL1 expression through TLR2/PPARγ-mediated epigenetic silencing of the CXCL1 promoter.[73] Our findings validate CXCL1’s pathogenic centrality and propose combinatorial blockade of Glutamic acid-Leucine-Arginine(ELR)⁺ chemokine networks (CXCL1/CXCL8-CXCR1/2) as a precision strategy for refractory gout.[74,75]IL-1Ra serves as a critical endogenous regulator of gout inflammation through competitive IL-1 receptor blockade. A multi-cohort analysis reveals serum IL-1Ra levels correlate with both hyperuricemia severity and acute-phase C-reactive protein,[76] suggesting its dual role as a disease activity biomarker and compensatory anti-inflammatory responder. Our study also corroborates these findings, demonstrating that gouty arthritis can lead to elevated levels of IL-1Ra. Experimental models further demonstrate 3.8-fold IL-1Ra elevation in rabbit synovial fluid during MSU crystal-induced acute flares,[77] mechanistically explained by NLRP3 inflammasome activation triggering negative feedback via PGE2/EP4-mediated IL-1Ra production. Crucially, synovial IL-1Ra concentrations inversely associate with radiographic progression,[57] supporting combination therapy with recombinant IL-1Ra (e.g., anakinra) and xanthine oxidase inhibitors to simultaneously counterbalance IL-1β excess and urate overproduction. Our findings validate IL-1Ra as a dynamic therapeutic target, with phase-resolved monitoring (acute vs intercritical) guiding personalized IL-1 blockade strategies.TNF-α orchestrates gout pathogenesis through dual-phase immunometabolic crosstalk. During the initiation phase, MSU crystals activate synovial macrophages via TLR2/4-MyD88 signaling, triggering NF-κB-dependent transcription of both membrane-bound (mTNF-α) and soluble TNF-α (sTNF-α).[78,79] Clinically, serum TNF-α levels correlate with acute flare intensity and predict tophus progression,[80,81] while the TNF-α -863C/A polymorphism increases gout susceptibility 2.3-fold.[79] One such agent is Infliximab, a recombinant monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to and neutralizes TNF-α, thereby blocking its pro-inflammatory effects and providing effective treatment for gout.[82] Currently, therapies targeting IL-1β and TNF-α are promising treatment options, though further clinical research is needed. This study also confirms the positive correlation between TNF-α and gout, offering valuable insights for future drug development and clinical research.This study offers several significant advantages. Firstly, it represents the first bidirectional MR investigation into the causal relationship between CIPs and gout. In comparison to traditional observational studies, MR is less susceptible to bias arising from confounding variables, environmental factors, and reverse causality, thus providing more robust and reliable results. Secondly, this study is currently the largest to analyze the causal associations between CIPs and gout, incorporating a greater number of CIPs than previous research. Thirdly, we utilized a variety of MR methods, including IVW, weighted median, MR-Egger, and weighted mode, to ensure the robustness and reliability of the findings. While our MR analysis provides novel insights into the causal relationships between CIPs and gout, several limitations warrant consideration. First, although robust genetic instruments (F-statistics > 10) were employed, the statistical power to detect small effect sizes remained limited for certain CIPs due to moderate exposure GWAS sample sizes, increasing the likelihood of false-negative results. Second, our analysis assumes linearity in exposure-outcome relationships and cannot entirely exclude residual pleiotropy, though sensitivity analyses (MR-Egger, weighted median) supported result robustness. Additionally, the predominantly Finnish and European ancestry of the study populations may introduce genetic heterogeneity (e.g., historical population bottlenecks, geographical isolation, genetic drift), as evidenced by discrepancies in causal estimates for specific CIPs (e.g., IFN-γ and CXCL1) between the GWAS Catalog and IEU OpenGWAS databases. Notably, after Bonferroni correction for multiple testing, several associations lost statistical significance, potentially reflecting stringent correction-induced type II errors. Furthermore, inconsistent causal links were observed for established inflammatory mediators (e.g., TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8), possibly attributable to limited ancestral diversity or insufficient instrument strength in MR models. To address these limitations and advance translational applications, future studies should prioritize trans-ethnic GWAS meta-analyses to enhance ancestral diversity and statistical power, integrate protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) to refine causal inference precision, conduct randomized controlled trials targeting prioritized CIPs (e.g., IL-1β, TNF-α inhibitors), and implement larger-scale MR studies incorporating longitudinal imaging biomarkers (e.g., dual-energy CT urate volume) to resolve inconsistencies and elucidate temporal dynamics.5. ConclusionsIn summary, this bidirectional MR study provides more robust evidence than previous observational studies, demonstrating the association between several cytokines and gout. Specifically, we identified multiple CIPs, including FGF21, MMP-1, G-CSF, IFN-γ, CXCL1, IL-1Ra, and TNF-α, which may serve as potential molecular therapeutic targets for gout. While some of these results warrant further validation, this study has successfully pinpointed candidate cytokines that could facilitate future investigations into the pathogenesis of gout. These findings offer a new theoretical foundation for advancing research and treatment strategies for gout. Moreover, future drug development targeting key cytokine functions could lead to novel therapeutic approaches for both the prevention and treatment of gout, with significant implications for the clinical management of the disease.AcknowledgmentsWe extend our gratitude to all the investigators and participants who contributed to the genetic association summary data used in this studyAuthor contributionsConceptualization: Xiaochao Xie, Fang Wang.Data curation: Xiaochao Xie, Yanjie Song.Formal analysis: Xiaochao Xie.Funding acquisition: Xiaochao Xie.Investigation: Xiaochao Xie, Yanjie Song.Methodology: Xiaochao Xie.Project administration: Xiaochao Xie.Resources: Xiaochao Xie, Hui Zhao, Nan Chu.Software: Xiaochao Xie, Wenwen Chen.Supervision: Fang Wang.Validation: Xiaochao Xie, Wenwen Chen.Visualization: Xiaochao Xie, Yanjie Song.Writing – original draft: Xiaochao Xie.Writing – review & editing: Xiaochao Xie, Wenwen Chen, Fang Wang.Supplementary Material"}

The control group comprised nonathletes. The primary outcome was the difference in CAC scores between athletes and nonathletes and the secondary outcome was the differences in calcified plaque by CCTA. The analysis was stratified by sex and exercise volume assessed using metabolic equivalents of task (MET)-min/wk.ResultsNine observational studies including 61,150 participants were included in the analysis. Male athletes with an exercise volume of >3,000 MET-min/wk showed higher mean CAC scores than nonathlete males (mean difference = 31.62; 95% CI: 10.66-52.58; P < 0.001), while no difference in CAC was found for male athletes with 1,500 to 3,000 MET-min/wk (P = 0.93) or female athletes with an exercise volume of 1,500 MET-min/wk or greater (P = 0.39 and P = 0.07). Our secondary endpoint showed significant sex-specific differences on the association of exercise volume and calcified plaque number and volume by CCTA.ConclusionsMales with high-volume exercise training (>3,000 MET-min/wk) exhibited a higher burden of calcified plaque by CAC score than male nonathletes, while no such difference was observed in female athletes.", "body": "Atherosclerosis and plaque formation are influenced by multiple factors, including sex, genetics, lifestyle, and exercise volume and duration. The relationship between endurance exercise and coronary atherosclerosis is a complex and highly debated topic in the scientific community.1 While regular physical activity (PA) is widely recognized for its cardiovascular (CV) benefits, including the reduction of risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia, emerging evidence suggests that high-volume (>3,000 metabolic equivalents of task [MET]-min/wk) endurance training may paradoxically lead to a higher incidence of coronary atherosclerosis and plaque progression in athletes.2,3 This is particularly striking given that endurance athletes who engage in intensive PA over a long period are generally perceived to possess superior CV health compared to the general population.4 However, recent studies have highlighted that such athletes may be at an increased risk of developing CV disease (CVD) complications, which are typically associated with sedentary lifestyles and traditional CVD risk factors.5 This paradox raises important questions regarding the balance between the benefits and potential risks of extreme endurance exercise.6Compelling evidence has underscored sex-specific differences in the incidence, underlying risk profiles, and clinical outcomes of CV disease.7 Notably, females appear to derive greater CV benefits from equivalent doses of PA compared to males,8 underscoring the importance of investigating study sex-specific responses to exercise in CV health. Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) and coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring are the preferred methods for the quantification and detection of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis, with CAC scoring as the standard quantification method for CAC burden, while CCTA can also visualize both calcified and noncalcified plaques.9In light of these uncertainties, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to synthesize current evidence on the relationship between endurance exercise and coronary atherosclerosis assessed as CAC using the Agatston score or the presence of plaques on CCTA, particularly focusing on the relationship between exercise volume, CVD risk factors, and coronary atherosclerosis, stratified by sex.MethodsData sources and searchesThis meta-analysis was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guideline10 and registered in PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews) (CRD42024573617). We searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library from inception until September 2024 without any language restrictions, with the following search terms: (“Athletes” OR “Runners” OR “Marathon”) AND (“Coronary atherosclerosis” OR “Coronary plaque”). The search terms, based on the retrieved databases, are presented in Supplemental Table 1. Additional manual citation analysis was adopted to search for relevant articles from previous meta-analyses and those that were not shown in the search. Two authors independently conducted the literature search, screened the titles and abstracts, and selected the final included articles. Any disagreements during the selection process were resolved by discussion and consensus with a third author.Study selection and outcomesWe included studies on asymptomatic individuals meeting the following inclusion criteria: 1) athletes engaged in high-volume training modalities such as running and cycling, with no prior history of coronary artery disease (CAD); 2) observational study design; 3) nonathletes who engaged in low-volume exercise and had no history of CAD; and 4) the outcome assessed in the study was subclinical coronary atherosclerosis assessed by CAC scoring or plaque evaluated by CCTA. Studies involving participants with preexisting symptomatic CVD or a history of CAD were excluded. Athletes were defined as per 2020 European Society of Cardiology guidelines as individuals who engage in regular exercise and competitive sporting events.11 We classified exercise volumes in athletes according to their METs relative to total exercise duration (min/wk) into 2 primary categories: 1) high volume of ≥3,000 MET-min/wk; and 2) moderate volume of 1,500 to 3,000 MET-min/wk.11,12 Nonathletes were defined as individuals with an exercise volume of <1,500 MET-min/wk, and no prior history of regular PA.11,12The primary outcome was the CAC score assessed by a noncontrast dedicated CAC scan measured in Agatston units (AU), while the secondary outcomes were coronary plaque volume measured by CCTA,13 the volume of calcified plaques, and the mean number of plaques per patient assessed using CCTA. In addition, the degree of CAC (>0-10 AU, >11-100, >101-400, and >400 AU) was studied.14 The control group comprised nonathletes.Quality assessment and data extractionData were extracted from the included studies using prespecified extraction forms. The data consisted of the baseline characteristics of the included patients, study characteristics, and the specified outcomes. Two reviewers independently assessed the quality of the included studies using the modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for observational studies.15 The scale uses 3 main domains to assess the study quality: selection criteria, comparability testing, and outcome assessment. The risk of bias for each study was classified as good, poor, or fair. In the event of disagreement, the reviewers discussed the issues to reach consensus.Statistical analysisThe pooled OR for dichotomous data using event and total for each outcome, and the mean difference (MD) for continuous data using the mean and SD for each outcome, with the corresponding 95% CIs, were calculated using a random effects model. The median (IQR) were converted to mean ± SD.16Heterogeneity was assessed using Cochrane's Q test and an I2 value ≥50% with a P value of ≤0.10 was considered significant heterogeneity. Separate analyses of all studied outcomes according to sex were performed. Additionally, differences in outcomes were assessed based on 2 levels of exercise volumes: 1,500 to 3,000 MET-min/wk and ≥3,000 MET-min/wk. To evaluate publication bias, the LFK plots were visually reviewed using the DOI method.Furthermore, sensitivity analysis was conducted by excluding one study at a time (leave-one-out method) to investigate the influence of each study on the overall effect size estimate. We performed a random-effect meta-regression between mean age, baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, body mass index (BMI), and CAC scores across male and female athletes and nonathletes. All statistical analyses were performed using STATA (StataCorp LLC) 18MP.17ResultsSearch results and characteristicsThe initial literature search yielded 4,399 articles. Of these, 2,400 were duplicates and 1,999 citations were included in the title and abstract screening. The full texts of 50 articles were reviewed, and 9 studies were included in the final analysis18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26 (Figure 1).Figure 1PRISMA Flow Diagram for Study Selection Process for Inclusion in the Meta-AnalysisPRISMA = Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis.Due to the nature of the predefined criteria, only observational studies were included in this study. The studies were conducted in several countries: 5 in the United States, one in the Netherlands, one in Belgium, one in the United Kingdom, and one in Germany. The 9 studies included a total of 61,150 participants, with 27,830 athletes and 33,320 nonathletes. Among the athletes, 8,607 (30.92%) were female, while the nonathlete group included 9,532 (28.61%) females. None of the participants had an established history of CAD, and the median age across the studies was 55 years (range: 49-61 years). Detailed summary and baseline features of the included studies are presented in Tables 1 and 2, respectively.Table 1Summary Data of Included StudiesFirst Author, YearStudy ArmsSiteStudy DesignMedical HistoryCurrent and Former SmokersType of SportCardiac Imaging ModalityExposure DefinitionInclusion CriteriaPrimary EndpointsConclusionAengevaeren, 2017<1,000 MET-min/wk, 88 (30.99)NetherlandsRetrospective cohort study1.HTN, 7 (8)2.DM, 1 (1)3.FH of CHD, 29 (33)1.Current, 7 (8)2.Former, 32 (36)3.Never, 49 (56)Competitive or recreational leisure sportsCCTA scanIndividuals perform 500-1,000 MET-min/wk of exercise1.Men ≥45 y of age2.Asymptomatic, engaged in competitive or recreational leisure sports3.Were free of known CVD4.Had undergone a sports medical examination with bicycle exercise ECG that revealed no abnormalitiesCAC plaques prevalence“Participants in the >2,000 MET-min/wk group had a higher prevalence of CAC and atherosclerotic plaques.

95% CI: −24.66 to 27.05; P = 0.93; I2: 89.2%). However, male athletes with an exercise volume of >3,000 MET-min/wk showed notably higher mean CAC scores than male nonathletes (MD = 31.62; 95% CI: 10.66-52.58; P < 0.001; I2: 74.53%) (Figure 2).Figure 2Forest Plot of CAC Score in Males With a Subgroup Analysis on Exercise VolumeCAC = coronary artery calcification.Publication bias was assessed using a DOI plot in which there was no asymmetry, with an LFK index of 0.29, indicating no significant publication bias (Figure 3). Moreover, we performed a sensitivity analysis (leave-one-out analysis) in athletes with an exercise volume of >3,000 MET-min/wk, and no study had a disproportional effect on the overall effect estimate (Figure 4).Figure 3Publication Bias Assessment of CAC Score in Male Athletes and Nonathletes Using DOI Plot MethodLFK index = 0.29, indicating no asymmetry is found and no publication bias is detected.

In contrast with male athletes, female athletes achieving an exercise volume of 1,500 to 3,000 and >3,000 MET-min/wk showed no statistically significant difference compared to the female nonathlete group (MD = −8.22; 95% CI: −26.83 to 10.4; P = 0.39; and −10.01; 95% CI: −20.82 to 0.8; P = 0.07) (Figure 5).Figure 5Forest Plot of CAC Score in Females With a Subgroup Analysis on Exercise VolumeAbbreviation as in Figure 2.Meta-regression analysis showed no significant effect modification of mean age, baseline LDL-C levels, or BMI on the differences in CAC scores between male and female athletes and nonathletes (Supplement Table 3).CAC stagesThe prevalence of CAC scores between 0 and 10 AU was evaluated in 4 studies of participants with exercise volumes of >3,000 MET-min/wk.19,20,22,23 The analysis showed no significant differences in CAC prevalence between male (OR: 1.08; 95% CI: 0.81-1.43; P = 0.6; I2 = 0%) and female athletes (OR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.31-1.88; P = 0.55; I2 = 0%) compared with nonathletes (Supplement Figure 1). Similarly, when examining CAC scores between 10 and 100 AU, athletes (both male and female) with an exercise volume of >3,000 MET-min/wk had comparable prevalence to nonathletes, with ORs of 1.3 (95% CI: 0.74-2.3; P = 0.36; I2 = 73%) for males and 0.52 (95% CI: 0.16-1.71; P = 0.28; I2 = 0%) for females (Supplement Figure 2).In 5 studies,18,20,22, 23, 24 male athletes with an exercise volume of >3,000 MET-min/wk had a higher prevalence of CAC scores between 100 and 400 AU than male nonathletes (OR: 1.41; 95% CI: 1.22-1.62; P < 0.001; I2 = 0%), without significant difference between male athletes with an exercise volume of 1,500 to 3,000 MET-min/wk and male nonathletes (OR: 1.21; 95% CI: 0.91-1.6; P = 0.2; I2 = 19.01%) (Supplement Figure 3).Only 2 studies22,24 evaluated the prevalence of CAC scores >100 to 400 AU among female athletes and found no significant differences between those with exercise volumes of 1,500 to 3,000 MET-min/wk or >3,000 MET-min/wk and female nonathletes. The respective ORs were 0.98 (95% CI: 0.79-1.23; P = 0.89; I2 = 0%) and 0.87 (95% CI: 0.67-1.12; P = 0.27; I2 = 0%) (Supplement Figure 4).Finally, for CAC scores >400 AU, 3 studies20,22,23 reported no significant differences between athletes with exercise volumes of >3,000 MET-min/wk and nonathletes, either for males (OR: 1.57; 95% CI: 0.94-2.61; P = 0.08; I2 = 0%) or females (OR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.05-13.65; P = 0.89; I2 = 0%) (Supplement Figure 5).Subclinical atherosclerosis using CCTATwo studies reported the mean number of calcified lesions burden per patient by CCTA, of which the pooled estimate showed that male and female athletes with an exercise volume of 1,500 to 3,000 MET-min/wk had comparable number of calcified plaques compared to the nonathletes groups with the following values (MD = −0.03; 95% CI: −0.87 to 0.81; P = 0.95; I2 = 94.87%, and −0.24; 95% CI: −0.51 to 0.04; P = 0.09; I2 = 85.63%). However, female athletes with an exercise volume of >3,000 MET-min/wk showed lower number of calcified plaques per patient compared to the female nonathletes (MD = −0.26; 95% CI: −0.42 to −0.1; P < 0.001; I2 = 0%), without significant difference in males with an exercise volume of >3,000 MET-min/wk compared to nonathletes males (MD = 0.82; 95% CI: −0.14 to 1.78; P = 0.09; I2 = 92.45%) (Table 3).Table 3Secondary Outcomes by SexOutcomesSexPooled Effect Sizes1,500-3,000 MET-min/wk>3,000 MET-min/wkNo. of StudiesMean Difference (95% CI)Heterogeneity (I2, P Value)No. of StudiesMean Difference (95% CI)Heterogeneity (I2, P Value)No. of calcified plaques per patientsMales2−0.03 (−0.87 to 0.81, P = 0.95)(94.87%, P < 0.001)20.82 (−0.14 to 1.78, P = 0.09)(92.45%, P < 0.001)Females2−0.24 (−0.51 to 0.04, P = 0.09)(85.63%, P < 0.001)2−0.26 (−0.42 to −0.1, P < 0.001)(0%, P = 0.28)Calcified lesions volumeMales1−16.23 (−27.56 to −4.9, P < 0.001)–226.91 (12.06-41.76, P < 0.001)(0%, P = 0.32)Females1−10.75 (−16.52 to −4.98, P < 0.001)–2−16.89 (−38.17 to 4.39, P = 0.12)(29.18%, P = 0.16)Calcified plaquesMales1OR 1.52 (0.96-2.42, P = 0.07)–2OR 2.31 (0.67-7.98, P = 0.19)(87.42%, P < 0.001)Females––––––Abbreviations as in Table 1.Moreover, the volume of calcified plaques was lower in male and female athletes with an exercise volume of 1,500 to 3,000 MET-min/wk compared to the nonathletes' groups with the following values, respectively (MD = −16.23 mm3; 95% CI: −27.56 to −4.9; P < 0.001, and −10.75 mm3; 95% CI: −16.52 to −4.98; P < 0.001). On the other hand, the volume of calcified plaques was higher in males with an exercise volume of >3,000 MET-min/wk compared to male nonathletes (MD = 26.91 mm3; 95% CI: 12.06-41.76; P < 0.001; I2 = 0%), without a significant difference in the female groups (MD = −16.89 mm3; 95% CI: −38.17-4.39; P = 0.12; I2 = 29.18%) (Table 3).Additionally, the prevalence of calcified plaques was reported only in male athletes. There were no significant differences observed between male athletes with an exercise volume of 1,500 to 3,000 MET-min/wk and >3,000 MET-min/wk compared to male nonathletes regarding the incidence of calcified plaques, with the following values, respectively (OR: 1.52; 95% CI: 0.96-2.42; P = 0.07, 2.31; 95% CI: 0.67-7.98; P = 0.19) (Table 3).DiscussionOur meta-analysis of 9 studies, encompassing 61,150 participants, addressed the effect of exercise on the prevalence of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis across different exercise volume levels (Central Illustration). The present analysis included healthy participants without any prior CVD and found the following: 1) male athletes engaging in exercise volume exceeding 3,000 MET-min/wk had significantly higher mean CAC scores and total calcified plaque volumes, as determined by CAC dedicated scans and CCTA, respectively, compared to nonathletes, while male athletes exercising between 1,500 and 3,000 MET-min/wk had significantly lower total calcified plaque volumes than nonathletes; 2) female athletes exercising above 3,000 MET-min/wk had a significantly lower number of calcified plaques per patient than nonathletes, and female athletes with exercise volumes between 1,500 and 3,000 MET-min/wk had significantly lower total calcified plaque volumes than nonathletes, as assessed by CCTA.Central IllustrationSex Differences in the Impact of Exercise Volume on Subclinical Coronary Atherosclerosis: A Meta-AnalysisCAD = coronary artery disease; CCTA = coronary computed tomography angiography; CT = computed tomography; other abbreviations as in Figures 2 and 4.Various factors influence the development of coronary atherosclerosis in athletes; however, the precise mechanisms remain unclear. One theory suggests that elevated shear stress during intense exercise causes endothelial damage, leading to atherosclerotic plaque formation through repeated injury and calcification.27,28 Statin use in athletes may also contribute to plaque calcification and plaque stabilization over time. Other potential contributors include dietary intake, psychological stress, chronic inflammation, and genetics.29 Some studies have proposed that intense exercise may accelerate the progression of pre-existing CAD, and mechanical pressure on calcified plaques could lead to plaque rupture and thrombus formation.30,31 Elevated parathyroid hormone levels and inflammation during intense exercise may further promote atherosclerosis.32 Vascular oxidative stress, caused by intense exercise, could contribute to coronary artery calcification. Hormonal factors like testosterone may also play a role in calcification, but more research is needed.33,34The influence of factors such as sex, exercise volume, ethnicity, and sport type on CAD development in athletes remains insufficiently understood. Females in particular are underrepresented in studies examining the effects of high-volume exercise on CVD outcomes. The scarcity of data in female cohorts suggests a lower prevalence of CAD among women. In a study by Merghani et al22 involving 244 individuals (athletes and controls) with a low 10-year Framingham Risk Score (FRS) for CAD and using CCTA, male athletes exhibited a higher likelihood of moderate to severe CAC ≥300 and atherosclerotic plaques with luminal abnormalities than controls. However, among female participants, no significant differences were observed between the athletes and controls in the number of plaques (15% vs 21%; P = 0.57), CAC ≥100 (7% vs 11%; P = 0.62), or plaque incidence. Roberts et al26 analyzed subclinical CAD using CCTA in 26 lifelong female marathon runners (each having completed at least one marathon annually for 10-25 years). They found these athletes had reduced coronary calcium burden, a lower prevalence of plaques, and smaller plaque volumes than controls. Our pooled analysis contrasts with previous studies which reported that high-volume female athletes had more calcified plaques per patient than nonathletes. In contrast, female athletes with moderate exercise volumes had significantly lower total calcified plaque volumes than nonathletes.22,24 However, the findings of other studies may be confounded by differences in baseline CVD risk profiles, as the control group had higher BMI and a greater prevalence of traditional CVD risk factors.In most previous studies, elite male athletes showed higher CAC scores and greater coronary atherosclerosis prevalence than risk-matched controls. The Measuring Athlete’s Risk of Cardiovascular Events (MARC) study found occult CAD in 16% of 318 middle-aged athletes with low CV risk, defined as CAC >100 or significant coronary stenosis on CCTA.35 Mohlenkamp et al23 investigated subclinical atherosclerosis in 108 experienced recreational marathon runners aged 50 or older, with no history of cardiac disease, comparing them to age- and FRS-matched controls. Despite lower FRS values, 36% of runners had CAC scores >100, similar to controls. These findings are in contrast to our pooled analysis. Specifically, the referenced study found no significant differences between runners and controls regarding the prevalence of CAC scores >100. Our pooled analysis demonstrated a significantly higher prevalence of CAC scores >100 in male athletes compared to nonathletes. Potential explanations are the variability in the volume and intensity of regular PA and marathon running. Factors such as years of active running, number of marathons completed, or weekly training mileage may account for this heterogeneity, potentially affecting the paradoxical effect of excessive exercise volume on CAC scores.The prognostic implications of high CAC scores and subclinical CAD in athletes remain unclear. Concerns have arisen that lifelong high-volume exercise may increase CV risk, as seen in a French study reporting CAD in 95% of nearly 900 sudden sports-related deaths. Athletes with high-risk pre-existing CAD may be particularly vulnerable to myocardial infarction during high-volume exertion. While calcified plaques, common in athletes with elevated CAC, are linked to reduced rupture risk, high CAC scores (>400) significantly increase the likelihood of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) compared to a CAC score of 0 (34% vs 2.1%). The Mohlenkamp trial showed a lower prevalence of zero CAC (28.7% vs 47.5%) and higher event frequency at CAC >100 compared to the MARC study.23Despite elevated CAC in athletes, lower exercise levels are associated with greater atherosclerosis progression, as evidenced by the findings of Delaney et al36 in the MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) trial. Similarly, studies by Ji et al, Gao et al, and Radford et al suggest that PA mitigates CVD risks, even with high CAC scores.8,37,38 German et al reinforced these results, showing that increased PA reduces all-cause mortality, irrespective of CAC levels. Moreover, higher cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) was linked to reduced CAD risk, with each 1 MET increase in CRF lowering CVD event rates by 14%.39 These findings underscore the protective effects of PA and CRF against CVD events, even in individuals with elevated CAC levels.40The benign nature of coronary atherosclerosis in athletes has been questioned by the Master Heart study20 comparing 191 lifelong elite endurance athletes with 176 healthy nonathletes with low CVD risk profiles. Excluding individuals with a history of smoking, dyslipidemia, hypertension, or diabetes, the study revealed that athletes had a more significant coronary plaque burden. Athletes exhibited higher frequencies of noncalcified and mixed plaques, proximal plaques, and considerable stenosis (OR: 1.96; 95% CI: 1.24-3.11), all associated with increased CVD risk. Although CAC is linked to adverse CVD events in the general population, its implications for elite athletes remain uncertain, and elevated CAC should not discourage PA. However, it is worth noting that they used a self-report questionnaire rather than continuous tracking of training logs over time to define the different levels of exercise and atherosclerotic CVD risk factors, which may lead to underestimation of these factors at the study's baseline. Limiting their population to male participants, owing to the lower risk of CAD in females may also have a minor contribution. This study underscores the importance of integrating CT findings with CVD risk factors, symptoms, and electrocardiogram findings. This nuanced issue requires further investigation to clarify its implications for athletes' CV health.A recent study by Pavlovic et al24 extended beyond conventional variables and explored the relationship between PA intensity and duration and CAC. A negative association was observed between PA intensity and CAC >100 AU, whereas the total weekly PA duration was positively correlated with CAC levels. Their study demonstrated a 2.4% increase in mean CAC per hour of PA and a 19.9% increase in mean CAC in men engaging in ≥5 hours of weekly PA vs <5 hours. They hypothesized that regular moderate-to-vigorous exercise may reduce atherogenic small, dense LDL particles, replacing them with larger, less harmful LDL. Additional benefits include reductions in blood pressure, LDL-C, triglycerides, fasting glucose, and hemoglobin A1C, alongside increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. However, high PA volumes may provoke an inflammatory response, potentially contributing to plaque formation, particularly in elite athletes.To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis to examine the relationship between subclinical coronary atherosclerosis and exercise volume, stratifying participants by sex and excluding those with prior CAD or CVD risk factors. Furthermore, we categorized participants based on CAC stages to approximate the extent to which CAC influences CAD risk, given that a CAC score ≥400 AU is associated with an estimated 34% risk of MACE, compared to a significantly lower risk of approximately 2.1% for a CAC score of 0.41,42 Additionally, we attempted to analyze CCTA data stratified by plaques per patient and calcified lesion volume, but this was feasible in only 2 studies owing to a lack of data.Study limitationsSeveral limitations may hinder the generalizability of our findings. While we attempted to stratify confounding variables, the pooled studies still offer opportunities for further validation. One such variable is race/ethnicity, as it is well established that race/ethnicity may influence CAC levels, with most studies predominantly focusing on White populations. Another major issue in the existing literature is that CAC images only calcified plaques while not visualizing noncalcified plaque. While CCTA could visualize noncalcified plaques, there was very limited data on noncalcified plaques among the included studies, precluding a separate analysis. Moreover, CCTA could also miss small amounts of CAC due to the administration of intravenous contrast, which may be important when quantifying individuals with low CAC levels. Additionally, as the studies included in our analysis were observational, they were subject to inherent biases due to the study design, and causality could not be established. Finally, there are limited data for female athletes and potential biases introduced mainly by predominantly male cohorts. These limitations underscore the need for future high-quality longitudinal studies that account for these confounding factors and establish standardized cutoff points.Implication on clinical practiceThis meta-analysis showed a higher prevalence of CAC and plaque volume can be present in high-exercise volume male athletes, despite the lower estimated CV risk. Therefore, the possibility of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis and need for preventive therapies should not be excluded. Standard estimation of CVD risk may result in an underestimation of the actual presence of atherosclerosis in athletes. In addition, athletic conditioning, with improvements in microvascular function and vessel size among athletes, may play a role in the disassociation between subclinical coronary atherosclerosis and mortality in athletes. However, long-term assessment is mandatory to assess the relationship between subclinical atherosclerosis, exercise volume, and clinical events in athletes.ConclusionsMale athletes engaging in high-volume exercise had significantly higher CAC scores and total calcified plaque volume. In contrast, those with moderate-volume exercise exhibited lower plaque volumes than nonathletes. Female athletes with high-volume exercise showed lower number of calcified plaques, whereas those with moderate-volume exercise demonstrated less plaque volumes. These results highlight the relationship between exercise volumes and subclinical coronary atherosclerosis, in addition to these noted sex differences. Our findings have potential implications for individualized exercise recommendations.However, our findings are tempered by limitations, including the observational nature of the included studies, limited data on plaque composition, and a lack of racial diversity, which restrict the generalizability and causal interpretation of the results. Future high-quality longitudinal studies are imperative to address these gaps, refine our understanding of the impact of exercise on atherosclerosis, clarify the prognostic value of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis in athletes and establish standardized thresholds for optimal exercise volume.PerspectivesCOMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: This meta-analysis showed that a higher prevalence of CAC and plaque can be present in high-volume male athletes, despite the lower estimated CV risk. Therefore, the possibility of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis and need for preventive lifestyle changes and therapies should not be excluded. Standard estimation of CVD risk may result in an underestimation of the actual presence of atherosclerosis in athletes. In addition, athletic conditioning, with improvements in microvascular function and vessel size among athletes, may play a role in the disassociation between CAC and mortality in athletes.TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Long-term assessment is mandatory to assess the relationship between subclinical atherosclerosis, exercise volume, and clinical events in athletes.Funding support and author disclosuresDrs Lorenzatti, Filtz, and Slipczuk are supported by institutional grants from 10.13039/100002429Amgen and Philips.

The time frame for the search was from the database's creation to September 1, 2024. The RevMan 5.4 software was used to conduct a meta-analysis after the literature was filtered based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and pertinent data was extracted following methodological quality evaluation.ResultsA total of 7 studies, including 1347 patients, were included. Meta-analysis showed that in a dominant model of inheritance, RST had a significant effect on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) [MD = -7.23, 95% CI (-8.71, -5.75), P < 0.05], total cholesterol (TC) [MD = -7.15, 95% CI (-8.71, -5.75), P < 0.05], and triglyceride (TG) [MD = -7.34, 95% CI (-10.88, -3.80), P < 0.05] in patients harboring an A allele decreased significantly more than CC, but there was no significant difference in the change of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) [MD = -2.22, 95% CI (-19.87, 15.43), P = 0.81]. The results of the sensitivity analysis suggested that all outcome indicators were stable. However, this study's small sample size may be heterogeneous, and more large-sample, multi-center studies are needed for future validation.ConclusionsThe ABCG2 c.421 C > A (rs2231142) SNP significantly affected the lipid-modulating efficacy of RST, especially the down-regulation of LDL-C, TC, and TG.", "body": "IntroductionThe primary chronic non-communicable disease that poses the greatest danger to human life and health globally is cardiovascular disease (CVD), for which hypercholesterolemia is a significant risk factor [1]. The mainstay of lipid reduction therapy is to effectively reduce atherosclerosis and cardiovascular risk by lowering LDL-C and TG levels and raising HDL-C levels in clinical practice. They are frequently used to avoid primary and secondary cardiovascular disorders and treat dyslipidemia [2]. The lipid-regulating effects of statins, however, vary significantly from person to person, according to specific research, and this variation is strongly linked to polymorphisms in the relevant drug genes, such as genetic variations of adenosine triphosphate binding transporter protein 2 (ABCG2) [3, 4].The ABCG2 gene encodes the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), widely distributed in the human brain, kidney, liver, placenta, small intestine, and other tissues. It is the major efflux transporter of RST and can obtain energy through the hydrolysis of ATP and actively excrete endogenous and exogenous substances to the outside of the cell. Based on its location and function, ABCG2 is considered a \"gatekeeper\" that, on the one hand, facilitates the removal of endogenous chemicals and, on the other, shields tissues from the entry of dangerous compounds like toxins and xenobiotics. One of the most prevalent variations in the ABCG2 gene is the ABCG2 c.421C > A SNP. Polymorphism is created when cytosine (C) is changed to adenine (A), which causes glutamine (Gln) to replace lysine (Lys) in the BCRP polypeptide and reduces BCRP's transporter capacity for RST. Furthermore, the mutation may result in a 30–40% decrease in the expression of BCRP on the cell membrane, which lowers the efflux of RST from hepatocytes and intestinal cells and raises the in vivo concentration of RST with improved effects. The c.421C > A mutation frequency was 35% in Asians, much higher than in non-Asians (14%) [5–10]. Further research must determine how the c.421C > A mutation affects RST transport in Asian individuals.Pharmacogenomics is one of the emerging approaches to precision medicine. By detecting individual genetic polymorphisms, pharmacogenomics provides precise guidance for drug selection, dosage adjustment, and medication monitoring. The prevalence of c.421C > A mutations in Asian populations and their consequences on RST transport underscore the significance of pharmacogenomics in personalized medicine.Currently, studies on how the ABCG2 c.421C > A polymorphism affects the effectiveness of RST have produced mixed results. For example, Tomlinson et al. [11] showed that the ABCG2 c.421C > A SNP was linked to a significant dose-dependent decrease in LDL-C levels. Subjects with the AA genotype experienced a 6.9% greater drop in LDL-C levels than those with the CC genotype; this is comparable to the impact of doubling the RST dosage. Nevertheless, it has also been proposed that the ABCG2 c.421C > A SNP has no discernible impact on RST effectiveness [12]. To offer an evidence-based foundation for clinically tailored treatment, this work aims to employ the meta-analysis approach to systematically assess the impact of the AABCG2 c.421C > A SNP on the lipid-lowering efficacy of RST.MethodsThis meta-analysis follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA).Inclusion criteria(1) Study subjects: patients with dyslipidemia treated with RST and not combined with other lipid-lowering drugs (e.g., fibrates, nicotinic acid, ezetimibe, etc.); (2) patients were tested for ABCG2 c.421C > A (rs2231142) polymorphisms, with unlimited detection time and methods; (3) the study provided patients with ABCG2 c.421C > A genotype information; (4) it provided the outcome metrics: the mean percentage change in patients' lipid indices (LDL-C, HDL-C, TC, TG) before and after treatment with RST.Exclusion criteria(1) reviews, conference papers, case reports, letters, and animal experiments; (2) duplicate publications; (3) patients with incomplete information; (4) studies with experimental data that could not be extracted or were not available.Literature search strategyPubMed, the Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Science, the Chinese Journal Full Text Database, and the Wan Fang database were all thoroughly searched using the following search terms: ABCG2, BCRP, RST, lipid-lowering effectiveness, and single nucleotide polymorphisms. Citation search was also used to search the reference lists and pertinent literature manually. Searching was restricted from the database's creation to September 1, 2024.Literature screening and data extractionTwo investigators independently evaluated the literature based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and a third investigator assessed the literature through discussion or intervention if there was disagreement. First author, publication year, research nation, sample size, treatment plan, genotyping technique, study design, and outcome measures were among the extracted data.Evaluation of the quality of the included literatureThe Newcastle–Ottawa scale (NOS), which assessed the quality of the included literature, was based on study population selection, between-group comparability, and evaluation of exposure/outcome factors. The total score was 9, with 1–4 denoting low-quality literature, 5–6 denoting moderate-quality literature, and 7–9 denoting high-quality literature.Statistical methodsMeta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.4 software. All extracted continuous data were as mean ± standard deviation. To determine the percentage change in lipid levels between rs2231142 genotypes, the mean difference (MD) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) were employed.Statistical heterogeneity among studies was analyzed using the χ2 test and the I2 test; when P ≥ 0.1 and I2 < 50%, it indicated that the heterogeneity among studies was small and a fixed-effects model was used; conversely (P < 0. 10 or I2 ≥ 50%), a random-effects model was used; if the analytical results were more heterogeneous or the heterogeneity could not be eliminated, sensitivity analyses were performed using a literature-by-literature exclusion method. Since most of the included studies presented lipid level changes and percentage of lipid level changes in a dominant model (CA + AA vs. CC), a dominant model was used to ensure adequate statistical power, and P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.ResultsLiterature search resultsA database search was conducted to retrieve an initial 300 literature items, and 150 duplicates were screened and excluded. Titles and abstracts were read according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and 135 studies were removed. Seven studies that satisfied the criteria were included after the remaining 15 publications were examined in full text; four studies failed to give outcome indicators, 1 study for which the complete text was unavailable, and three studies for which the necessary data were unavailable were eliminated. The literature screening process is detailed in Fig. 1.Fig. 1PRISMA Flowchart for selection of relevant studiesBasic information on included studiesThis meta-analysis comprised seven studies, including two randomized controlled trials [11, 13] and five cohort studies [12, 14–17]. Four were from China, two from Korea, and one from the United Kingdom. 1413 participants, including 703 wild-type (CC) patients and 644 mutant (CA + AA) patients, were treated with RST 10 mg/day or 20 mg/day. Treatment duration was > 3 weeks in all studies (Table 1).\nTable 1provides details of the characteristics included in this studyFirst authorYearCountryNumber of patientstreatmentdose/dayGene sequencing methodsoutcomesNOSCCCA + AABailey [13]2010United Kingdom2397112 weeks10 mgPCR③7Kim TE [14]2017Korea1448 weeks20 mgPCR①②③④4Kim Y [12]2019Korea1093 weeks20 mgPCR①②③④4Lee HK [15]2013China129147 > 4 weeks10 mgPCR③5Tomlinson [11]2010China158147 > 4 weeks10 mgPCR②③7Zhang [16]2020China75194 > 4 weeks10 mgSanger Dideoxy DNA sequencing①③④5Ma [17]2020China78726 weeks10 mgPCR①②③④5①TG: triglycerides②TC: total cholesterol③LDL-C: low-density lipoprotein cholesterol④HDL-C: high-density lipoprotein cholesterolResults of the quality assessment of the included literatureTwo studies were of high quality [11, 13], two studies were of low quality [12, 14], and three studies were of moderate quality [15–17].Effect of ABCG2 c.421C > A SNP on LDL-C levelsA total of seven studies evaluated the effect of the ABCG2 c.421C > A SNP on LDL-C changes, and statistical heterogeneity among studies was small (P = 0.08, I2 = 48%), so they were meta-analyzed using a fixed-effects model. The results of the analysis showed that patients with the CA + AA genotype had a greater reduction in LDL-C levels compared with the CC genotype [MD = −7.23, 95% CI (−8.71, −5.75), P < 0.05], and the difference was statistically significant. Subgroup analyses showed that the differences were still statistically significant for both 10 mg [MD = −7.14, 95% CI (−8.70, −5.59), P < 0.05] and 20 mg [MD = −8.09, 95% CI (−12.92, −3.26), P < 0.05] at the different RST doses (Fig. 2).Fig. 2The effect of ABCG2 c.421C > A SNP on LDL-C level lowering by RSTEffect of ABCG2 c.421C > A SNP on HDL-C levelsTwo investigations documented the impact of the ABCG2 c.421C > A SNP with RST on HDL-C modulation. Due to their substantial heterogeneity (P = 0.005, I2 = 81%), a random-effects model was used to examine these trials. The findings demonstrated that there was no statistically significant difference in the level of HDL-C improvement between patients with the CA + AA genotype and those with the CC genotype [MD = −2.22, 95% CI (−19.87, 15.43), P = 0.81] (Fig. 3).Fig.3The effect of ABCG2 c.421C > A SNP on the elevation of HDL-C level by RSTEffect of ABCG2 c.421C > A SNP on TC levelsA fixed-effects model was used to meta-analyses the four studies that assessed the impact of the ABCG2 c.421C > A SNP on the TC-lowering effect of RST because there was minimal statistical heterogeneity between them (P = 0.64, I2 = 0%). The findings demonstrated a statistically significant difference in TC improvement between patients with the CA + AA genotype and those with the CC genotype [MD = −7.15, 95% CI (−8.78, −5.53), P < 0.05]. At both RST doses, 10 mg [MD = −6.95, 95% CI (−8.67, −5.23), P < 0.05] and 20 mg [MD = −9.02, 95% CI (−14.18, −3.85), P < 0.05], subgroup analysis revealed that the differences were still statistically significant (Fig. 4).Fig. 4The effect of ABCG2 c.421C> A SNP on TC level lowering by RSTEffect of ABCG2 c.421C > A SNP on TG levelsA fixed-effects model was used for meta-analysis after three studies assessed the impact of the ABCG2 c.421C > A SNP on the TG-lowering effect of RST. The results showed that the effect was statistically less diverse among the trials (P = 0.26, I2 = 25%). The findings demonstrated that patients with the CA + AA genotype had a statistically significant improvement in TG compared to those with the CC genotype [MD = −7.34, 95% CI (−10.88, −3.80), P < 0.05]. The improvement of HDL-C at 20 mg of RST dosage did not differ significantly between mutant and wild-type patients, according to subgroup analysis [MD = −2.44, 95% CI (−12.42, 7.54), P = 0.63] (Fig. 5).Fig. 5The effect of ABCG2 c.421C> A SNP on TG level lowering by RSTSensitivity analysisSensitivity analysis was carried out by excluding individual studies in turn. After excluding literature with high heterogeneity, the LDL-C differences remained statistically significant, indicating that the analysis was relatively stable. Building on existing sensitivity analyses to further explore the impact of different study quality on the results, it became clear that low-quality studies did not significantly impact the overall results (Table 2).\nTable 2Test of heterogeneity Publication biasoutcomeNo. of study95%CIP valueI2(%)LDL(10 mg)Ma2020 [17][−7.83, −4.44]0.00010LDLKim Y [12][−10.28,−5.22]0.0000158Kim TE [14][−9.64, −4.90]0.0000154TGKim Y [12][−11.96,−4.52]0.00010Kim TE [14][−10.72,−3.53]0.000156DiscussionThis study showed that it significantly lowered LDL-C, TC, and TG in CA + AA type patients compared to CC type. Our study is consistent with the findings of Liu et al. [18] that the A allele variant significantly affects lipid levels. Still, our study clarifies the link between RST and ABCG2 more clearly.LDL-C is a significant risk factor for CVD. It is regarded as a primary target for treatment, with a 20%−23% decrease in CVD events for every one mmol/L reduction in LDL-C [19], according to the 2018 ACC/AHA [20], 2019 ESC/EAS [21], and Adult Treatment Group III (ATP III) cholesterol guidelines [22]. Therefore, LDL cholesterol reduction was used as a surrogate for cardiovascular risk reduction. According to this study, the rs2231142 A allele considerably enhanced RST's ability to decrease LDL-C in dyslipidemic people, indicating that those who carry the allele have superior CVD prevention with RST.Other lipids are regarded as secondary or complementary therapeutic targets. HDL-C levels are negatively correlated with the incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD). In the context of atherosclerosis, the primary protective function of HDL-C is its role as a dynamic molecular complex that facilitates reverse cholesterol transport, the transport of excess cholesterol from the peripheral cells back to the liver, and its excretion into the bile [23, 24]. In addition, TG is an independent risk factor for ASCVD and is also used as a risk factor for enhanced risk of ASCVD when risk stratification is performed. Patients with high TG after LDL-C compliance should be treated with concomitant TG-lowering therapy to reduce the risk of ASCVD further. In addition, in patients with severe high TG, lowering TG may reduce the risk of pancreatitis [25].While RST is a hydrophilic medication, it depends heavily on drug transporter proteins to pass across cell membranes and reach its site of action, unlike other statins. It primarily consists of the efflux transporter BCRP and the uptake transporter protein organic anion transporting polypeptide family 1B1 (OAT1B1), and the associated pharmacogenetic polymorphisms are a significant contributor to individual variations in RST. Of these, the ABCG2 SNP has the most significant impact on RST pharmacokinetics, especially in subjects carrying 2 A alleles, and the lipid-lowering efficacy of RST increased with increasing plasma concentrations [15]. Because of the lower frequency of SLCO1B1 mutations in Asians, this observation suggests that the ABCG2 421C > A SNP is more likely to be the key genetic factor influencing the pharmacokinetic changes of RST in Asian populations [26, 27].The frequency of genetic variants in ABCG2 was notably elevated in Asians compared to non-Asians. Furthermore, Asian and European individuals harboring the ABCG2 c.421C > A SNP variant exhibited heightened plasma concentrations of RST, particularly those with the AA genotype, in contrast to those with CA and CC genotypes. However, despite sharing the same ABCG2 genotype, Asian individuals were still more exposed to RST than their European counterparts, potentially due to a heightened absorption of statins within this population [28]. The studies included in our meta-analysis focused on Asian populations, but when analyzed in conjunction with the above information, the findings can be reasonably extrapolated to other ethnic groups.Furthermore, two recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) [29, 30] demonstrated that in people given RST, the A allele of ABCG2 rs2199936 reduced LDL-C levels. In the same genomic region of the ABCG2 gene, rs2231142 (chromosome: 4; location: 89,052,323) and rs2199936 (chromosome: 4; location: 89,264,355) are in linkage disequilibrium. Because alleles at these two loci tend to occur together when inherited by offspring, linkage disequilibrium suggests that they may have comparable biological activities or be regulated by the exact mechanisms [31, 32]. This study confirms that the effect of the A allele of rs2231142 on the lipid-lowering efficacy of RST echoes this.BCRP is a widely distributed hepatic and intestinal transporter protein that recognizes and binds various substrates, including RST. It influences their distribution and concentration in vivo through an active transport mechanism. The ABCG2 c.421C > A mutation inhibits ABCG2 function, which lowers BCRP activity and expression. This alteration reduces drug efflux in the biliary tract while increasing RST absorption in the gastrointestinal tract. Although the precise molecular mechanisms and signaling routes are unknown, the combination of increased absorption and slower hepatic clearance causes RST to accumulate in the systemic circulation, enhancing its ability to lower cholesterol [33].The Pharmacogenomic Knowledge Base (PharmGKB) assigns an evidence level of 2A (meaning essential pharmacogenetic gene with multiple study replicates but small sample size or differences not statistically significant) to the ABCG2 c.421C > A SNP and the efficacy of lipid modulation of RST [33, 34]. Due to a lack of data, there currently needs to be a consensus or pertinent professional guideline that suggests testing for ABCG2 before taking RST in dyslipidemic patients to advise customized therapy. Therefore, by conducting a meta-analysis of the effects of ABCG2 c. 421 C > A polymorphisms on the lipid-lowering efficacy of RST, this study sought to provide evidence-based evidence for the association between ABCG2 and C421A polymorphisms on the lipid-lowering efficacy of RST. Additionally, it sought to provide a reference basis for elucidating whether or not to consider the effect of ABCG2 c.421C > A SNP in the individualization of clinical dosage of RST.The potential impact of ABCG2 (c.421C > A) gene polymorphisms with altered RST kinetics on the risk of myopathy is controversial. Marco et al. [35] showed that statin-induced elevation of creatine kinase (CK) was not associated with polymorphisms in the ABCG2 (c.421C > A) gene and that the A allele did not significantly correlate with a high risk of myopathy [36, 37]. However, a case–control study demonstrated that the c.421C > A SNP increased the risk of RST-associated myotoxicity and hepatotoxicity approximately twofold [38]. Adverse effects and safety assessments were not performed in this study because the effect of each genotype on drug safety could not be statistically analyzed due to the small number of enrolled patients or mild reactions. Our study suggests the need to monitor the muscle status of dyslipidemic patients in the clinical management of RST and to adjust the dosage or consider alternative treatments based on genotypic test results to ensure patient safety and maximize efficacy.The results of the present study showed that ABCG2 c.421C > A SNP significantly affected the lipid-lowering effect of RST, especially in the downregulation of LDL-C, TC, and TG. However, this study has some limitations: (1) Small sample size and heterogeneity problem: The small sample size of the included studies may lead to heterogeneity problems. Future studies should include more large-sample, multicenter studies to reduce heterogeneity and improve the reliability of the results. In addition, the inclusion of low-quality studies in this study may have impacted the results, and it is recommended that future studies prioritize high-quality studies to improve the stability of the results. (2) No publication bias analysis was performed: Due to the limited number of studies, no publication bias analysis was performed. Nevertheless, we preliminarily assessed the risk of bias through funnel plots, and the results showed that the bias was negligible. Future studies should increase the sample size to assess publication bias more comprehensively. (3) Lack of safety data: This study should have discussed adverse reactions and safety in detail. Although existing studies suggest a controversial relationship between the ABCG2 c.421C > A SNP and RST-related adverse reactions (e.g., myopathy), future studies should incorporate safety data to assess tolerability in patients with different genotypes comprehensively. (4) Insufficient racial diversity: This study was primarily based on Asian populations and lacked analysis of other races (e.g., European populations). Future studies should include more cross-racial studies to verify the generalizability of the results. (5) Gene-environment interaction: This study did not explore the interaction between genotype and lifestyle (e.g., diet and exercise). Future studies should further analyze the interaction between genes and environmental factors to more fully explain the lipid-lowering effect of RST.ConclusionIn summary, although the current study provides important evidence for the effect of ABCG2 c.421C > A SNP on the lipid-lowering effect of RST, more large-sample, multicenter studies are needed to validate the reliability of the results. Future studies should focus on sample size, ethnic diversity, safety data, and gene-environment interactions to provide more comprehensive clinical guidance."}

Despite advances in conventional therapeutic strategies, the prognosis for HF patients remains challenging, and there is a constant search for novel therapeutic options. Among these, Panax quinquefolius saponin (PQS) has demonstrated promising pharmacological properties that may benefit HF. However, the efficacy and safety of PQS for HF have not been comprehensively evaluated.ObjectiveThis systematic review and meta-analysis aim to provide a more reliable estimation of the efficacy and safety of PQS for HF. This will help clinicians make informed decisions regarding the potential use of PQS in managing HF patients.MethodsWe comprehensively and systematically searched for published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the following eight electronic databases: PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of Science (WOS), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Science and Technology Journal Database (VIP), Wanfang Data, and China Biology Medicine Database (CBM) from database inception to March 2024. The Cochrane risk of bias (ROB 2.0) assessment tool was used for quality assessment, and Review Manager (RevMan, version 5.4) was used for meta-analysis. Mean difference (MD), 95% credible interval (CI), and relative risk (RR) estimates were calculated under a random-effects model. We also used GRADE profiler (GRADEpro, version 3.6) to analyze the quality of outcomes. In addition, the protocol has been registered in International Platform of Registered Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols (INPLASY) under registry number 202440050.ResultsThis study included nine RCTs involving a total of 952 patients with HF. The results of a meta-analysis under a random-effects model showed that adjuvant PQS therapy significantly increased LVEF (MD = 6.23, 95% CI [4.35, 8.12], P < 0.00001), 6MWTD (MD = 25.26, 95% CI [8.23, 42.30], P = 0.004), and decreased BNP/NT-pro-BNP (MD = −187.94, 95% CI [−267.20, −108.67], P < 0.00001), LVEDV (MD = −22.83, 95% CI [−42.79, −2.87], P = 0.02), LVEDD (MD = −4.76, 95% CI [−5.77, −3.74], P < 0.00001), and LVESV (MD = −11.86, 95% CI [−19.89, −3.83], P = 0.004) in patients with HF.ConclusionThe evidence provided by this systematic review suggests that adjunctive PQS therapy for HF can improved clinical efficacy and holds potential advantages in improving cardiac function and increasing exercise tolerance. However, given the limitations inherent in this review, the conclusions of this study should be interpreted cautiously. Therefore, in clinical practice, it is recommended that physicians tailor treatment strategies according to the specific circumstances of individual patients.Systematic Review registration\nhttps://inplasy.com/?s=202440050", "body": "1 IntroductionCurrently, the disability and mortality rates of heart disease are extremely high (GBD Causes of Death Collaborators, 2021). Among them, heart failure (HF) is the end stage of many cardiovascular diseases. At the same time, HF is a global health concern, affecting over 64 million people worldwide and leading to significant morbidity and mortality (Savarese et al., 2023). It is a clinical syndrome characterized by symptoms and/or signs resulting from structural and/or functional cardiac abnormalities, supported by elevated natriuretic peptide levels and/or objective evidence of pulmonary or systemic congestion (Bozkurt et al., 2021). HF presents clinical symptoms that include dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and peripheral edema. The majority of the affected population is elderly, and the incidence of the disease increases with age (McDonagh et al., 2021). However, there has been a growing trend towards occurring in younger individuals in recent years (McDonagh et al., 2022). The Report on Cardiovascular Health and Diseases in China 2023: an Updated Summary stated that there are 8.9 million people with HF, which the total cost of HF hospitalization in 2022 totaled 17.06 billion yuan (Diseases et al., 2024). Furthermore, the American Heart Association forecasts that the total cost of treating HF patients will increase from $31 billion in 2012 to $70 billion in 2030 (Heidenreich et al., 2013). HF leads to a marked decline in the quality of life for most patients and imposes a heavy economic burden on individuals and society (GBD Disease and Injury Incidence and Prevalence Collaborators, 2017, McDonagh et al., 2023), making it a significant public health problem.The interaction of multiple etiological and pathophysiological mechanisms constitutes the complex pathophysiology of HF (Chen et al., 2023). HF is primarily myocardial injury, leading to a progressive decline in the structure and function of the heart, culminating in end-stage heart disease (Lin et al., 2021). HF is mainly caused by risk factors for cardiovascular disease, including coronary heart disease (CHD), hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and diabetes (Ziaeian and Fonarow, 2016). In addition to cardiovascular diseases, non-cardiovascular diseases can also lead to HF. It is currently understood that HF is a chronic, progressive condition. The pathogenesis of HF involves multiple aspects (Maruyama and Imanaka-Yoshida, 2022; Aimo et al., 2020; Fontes et al., 2020; Abernethy et al., 2018). Firstly, activation of the neuroendocrine system leading to myocardial remodeling is a key factor in the onset and progression of HF (Hartupee and Mann, 2017). This includes adrenaline, noradrenaline, and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. The excessive activation of these systems can result in myocardial remodeling, including cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis, ultimately leading to impaired cardiac function. Secondly, myocardial metabolism is also a critical aspect of HF pathogenesis. Cardiomyocytes require significant energy to maintain normal contractile and diastolic functions, and any abnormalities affecting myocardial energy metabolism may lead to myocardial dysfunction (Da Dalt et al., 2023). Chronic inflammatory reactions can promote myocardial remodeling, cell apoptosis, and interstitial fibrosis, thereby causing a decline in myocardial function. Additionally, adipokines and cytokines are involved in regulating the pathogenesis of HF. For example, adipokines and cytokines associated with obesity may affect cardiac function through various pathways, including inducing cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, inflammatory reactions, and fibrosis (Packer, 2018). Damage to endothelial cells leading to insufficient nitric oxide secretion can result in impaired nitric oxide-soluble guanylate cyclase-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (NO-sGC-cGMP) signaling pathway, which also has significant effects on myocardial fibrosis and remodeling (Paulus and Tschöpe, 2013). Recent study has further highlighted the role of inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), in promoting myocardial inflammation and adverse remodeling in HF (Murphy et al., 2020). Mitochondrial dysfunction is also an essential factor in the occurrence and development of HF (Hinton et al., 2024; Zhou et al., 2020). It is a complex disease, and its pathogenesis involves the interaction of multiple factors. A thorough understanding of these mechanisms is crucial for preventing and treating HF. Based on the current pathogenesis, the conventional foundational pharmacotherapy primarily includes diuretics, renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RASI), β-blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA), sodium-glucose co-transporter two inhibitors (SGLT2i), and soluble guanylate cyclase stimulators (SGC) (Chinese Society of Cardiology, 2024), etc. These medications can reduce myocardial oxygen consumption, improve clinical symptoms and quality of life, and enhance exercise tolerance, thereby preventing or reversing ventricular remodeling, and reducing HF readmissions. However, these medications still cannot fully address the fundamental issue of HF (Wilcox et al., 2020), as mortality and readmission rates remain high. Therefore, there is a continual need to create new anti-HF medications to prevent and treat HF effectively.Panax quinquefolius (PQ), namely American ginseng, commonly known as North American ginseng, has been recognized as an herb of the genus Panax in the United States and Canada, and its roots and rhizomes have been used widely for more than 300 years in China (Xing et al., 2019; Ma et al., 2017). Panax quinquefolius saponin (PQS) is the main active component extracted from the stems and leaves of PQ and can be applied in the clinic of various diseases (Wang et al., 2015a). The saponins in the roots, stems, and leaves of PQ mainly include ginsenosides Rb1, Rb2, Rg1, Rb3, Rc, Rd, and Re (Xing et al., 2019). However, the content of ginsenosides in stems and leaves was significantly higher than in roots. PQ stems and leaves can be harvested from September to October every year, and ginsenosides produced from stems and leaves have the characteristics of lower cost (Zhang et al., 2022). Ginsenoside Rb3 (GRb3) is one of the main components absorbed into the bloodstream from PQS. Previous studies have shown its estrogen receptor agonistic effects, making it one of the pharmacological bases for PQS to exert estrogen-like cardiovascular protective effects (Pan et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2022). Additionally, a study has shown that ginsenoside Rg1 (GRg1) can influence factor secretion, manifested by reducing the secretion of collagen and TGF-β under high glucose conditions, thereby inhibiting the proliferation of cardiac fibroblasts. PQS can also inhibit the signaling of R-Smads/Co-Smad through the TGF-β1/Smads pathway, suppress the expression of connective tissue growth factor, thereby affecting myocardial fibrosis, and inhibiting HF (Zhang et al., 2023). Several previous pharmacological studies have found that PQS has the effects of being anti-oxidant, improving immunity and ventricular remodeling, anti-fatigue, increasing energy storage in ischemic myocardium, anti-inflammation, free radical scavenging, kidney protection, improving myocardial energy metabolism (Wang et al., 2015b; Tang et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2019). A present study demonstrates that North American ginseng attenuates β-adrenergic-activation-induced cardiac hypertrophy as well as HF by preventing PKA activation and CREB phosphorylation (Tang et al., 2016). Currently, a main patent preparation containing PQS components approved for market by the State Food and Drug Administration is Xinyue Capsule (launched in 2003, commercial name as Xinyue capsule, Z20030073) (Wang et al., 2023). It has been widely used for treating CHD for over 20 years. The Chinese Expert Consensus on the Clinical Application of Xinyue Capsule recommends the concurrent use of Xinyue Capsule with conventional medicine treatments for chronic heart failure (CHF). After treatment, it significantly improves left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in patients, clinical heart function grading, and lowers B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels (Liu et al., 2014). Prior basic research has confirmed that PQS combined with dual antiplatelet therapy can improve ventricular remodeling in rats with acute myocardial infarction (Kou et al., 2018). Additionally, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reports have shown that the application of PQS formulations on top of conventional medicine treatment can improve clinical symptoms, enhance cardiac function, and increase LVEF in patients with HF. This significantly improves the quality of life for patients. However, current RCTs suffer from limitations such as small sample sizes and low quality. Furthermore, the lack of comprehensive and objective systematic reviews and meta-analyses also leads to a lack of clear understanding of the overall efficacy and safety of PQS for HF. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PQS for HF, using high-quality clinical RCTs. The objective is to provide reliable evidence-based medicine for clinical practice.2 MethodsThe systematic review and meta-analysis were reported according to the Preferred Reporting Item for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (Page et al., 2021). No additional ethical approval or written consent from patients is required, as all data can be freely obtained from public databases. This protocol has been registered in International Platform of Registered Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols (INPLASY), and the registration number is 202,440,050.2.1 Search strategiesWe systematically searched for published RCTs in the following eight electronic databases: PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of Science (WOS), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Science and Technology Journal Database (VIP), Wanfang Data and China Biology Medicine Database (CBM) from database inception to March 2024 with no language restriction. The Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and keywords used for the search included: “heart failure,” “Cardiac Failure,” “Congestive Heart Failure,” “Heart Failure, Right-Sided,” “Heart Failure, Left Sided,” “heart incompetence,” “cardiac backward failure,” “chronic heart insufficiency,” “Heart Decompensation,” “Myocardial Failure,” “Panax quinquefolius saponin,” “PQS,” and “Xinyue capsule.” Please refer to the Supplementary Materials for details on the search strategy.2.2 Study selection and eligibility criteria2.2.1 Study designThis systematic review only included RCTs that meet the eligibility criteria for inclusion. The following were the specific inclusion criteria.2.2.2 PatientsParticipants who have been definitively diagnosed with HF.2.2.3 InterventionsHF patients meet the indications for PQS treatment. PQS preparations alone or combined with PQS preparations based on conventional treatment.2.2.4 Control group interventionsThe control group received conventional drug therapy or a placebo. Conventional drugs include diuretics, RASI, MRA,β-blockers, cardiotonic, and vasodilators.2.2.5 OutcomesReferring to the Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Heart Failure with Chinese Patent Medicine (2021) (Diseases, 2022), and consulting clinical doctors, the following outcome measures were ultimately determined: (1). Primary outcomes included LVEF, BNP or N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-pro-BNP), and 6-minute walk test distance (6MWTD). (2). Secondary outcomes included left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV), left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD), left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV), and adverse events.2.2.6 Exclusion criteriaThe exclusion criteria used in this review are as follows: (1). The study conducted on non-human subjects; (2). Literature available only in abstract form without full-text access; (3). The study has insufficient or irrelevant data that cannot be used for meta-analysis or to draw meaningful conclusions. (4). The same clinical data was published by the same author in different journals.2.3 Data extractionWe used EndNoteX9 to manage the retrieved records from the eight electronic databases mentioned above. Two researchers (Jing Wang and Zheng Liang) independently extracted data from the included studies strictly according to eligibility criteria and cross-checked the extracted data. If there is any disagreement about the extracted data, it can be discussed with a third researcher (Tianying Chang). The details of the extracted information were as follows: basic characteristics of studies (author, year, title, study location, study design, sample size, New York Heart Association (NYHA) cardiac function classification); interventions (dosing regimen, dose, treatment duration, follow-up time); subject characteristics (criteria for diagnosis of the disease, age, sex, course of disease); and primary outcomes (LVEF, BNP/NT-pro-BNP, 6MWTD), secondary outcomes (LVEDV, LVEDD, LVESV and adverse events).2.4 Assessment of risk of biasWe utilized the Risk of Bias assessment tool recommended by the Cochrane Handbook (ROB 2.0) to evaluate the risk of bias in the included studies. Two reviewers (Jing Wang and Tianying Chang) independently conducted the assessment based on the ROB criteria. ROB 2.0 assesses bias across five domains: randomization process, deviations from intended interventions, missing outcome data, outcome measurement, and selective outcome reporting. Each study can be assessed as having high RoB, some concerns, or low RoB. In discrepancies, consensus can be reached through discussion between the two reviewers or resolved through consultation with a third party (Zheng Liang).2.5 Statistical analysis and synthesisWe used RevMan (version 5.4) by the Cochrane Collaboration to analyze and synthesize the data. We synthesized available outcomes data from more than two studies for meta-analysis. Continuous outcomes data were presented as mean differences (MD) with 95% credible interval (CI), while for dichotomous data, risk ratios (RR) with 95% CI were used for analysis. We applied a random-effects model to conduct meta-analyses for all outcome measures and assessed heterogeneity using the I2 test. Sensitivity analysis and subgroup analysis were performed when statistical heterogeneity was present among included studies (I2 ≥ 30% and P ≤ 0.10). Subgroup analysis was conducted based on predefined variables to explore potential sources of heterogeneity: intervention measures in the treatment group (sole use of PQS preparations or in combination with other traditional Chinese medicines), intervention measures in the control group (selection of conventional therapeutic drugs), and duration of treatment (T ≤ 12 weeks, T > 12 weeks). Sensitivity analysis was performed using the leave-one-out method to ensure the robustness of the results. We sequentially excluded each study from the meta-analysis to evaluate its impact on the overall effect size and heterogeneity.To assess the certainty of evidence. We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) to grade the quality of evidence. We considered five aspects to determine whether to downgrade the evidence level: risk of bias (moderate risk downgrades by one level, high risk downgrades by two levels), inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias. Based on these assessments, the quality of evidence was categorized into four levels: high, moderate, low, and very low (Balshem et al., 2011). This work was independently conducted by two authors (Wang Jing and Tianying Chang) using GRADE profiler (GRADEpro, version3.6). If disagreements arise during the process, resolution could be achieved through discussion or consultation with a third author (Hongguang Jin).3 Results3.1 Literature screening resultsA total of 106 records were identified through a preliminary search in eight electronic databases. Then, we applied EndNoteX9 document management software to remove 40 duplicate records, and 66 records remained. After we had read the titles and abstracts, 53 papers were excluded for the following different reasons: ineligible studies (n = 48), conference papers (n = 2), dissertations (n = 2), and animal experiments (n = 1). The full-text of the 13 RCTs was further reviewed, of which 9 studies met the inclusion criteria, unclear diagnosis (n = 2), and non-RCTs (n = 2) were excluded. In the end, the meta-analysis included nine RCTs (Xie et al., 2023; Guan et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2021; Qian et al., 2021; Wang, 2018; Shi, 2014; Yu, 2013; Guo, 2012; Han et al., 2011). The study screening flow chart is shown in Figure 1.FIGURE 1Study screening flow chart.3.2 Characteristics of included studiesThe included nine RCTs, with a total of 952 patients with HF (480 in the PQS intervention group and 472 in the control group, comprising 398 females and 554 males). The ages of the patients ranged from 42 to 83 years old. The duration of treatment ranged from 16 days to 24 weeks. All of these RCTs were conducted in China and published in Chinese between 2011 and 2023. All intervention groups in the studies were administered PQS preparations (Xinyue Capsule) combined with routine anti-HF drug treatments (Xie et al., 2023; Guan et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2021; Qian et al., 2021; Wang, 2018; Shi, 2014; Yu, 2013; Guo, 2012; Han et al., 2011). In these RCTs, five studies (Xie et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2021; Qian et al., 2021; Shi, 2014; Han et al., 2011) reported the classification of NYHA heart function (NYHA classⅡ: 176 patients; NYHA class Ⅲ: 268 patients; NYHA class Ⅳ: 116 patients), and four studies (Qian et al., 2021; Yu, 2013; Guo, 2012; Han et al., 2011) mentioned that the course of HF ranged from four to 9 years. Additionally, one study (Xie et al., 2023) investigated specifically adverse events (intervention group: Two patients of dry cough, three patients of gastrointestinal reactions, two patients of hypokalemia; one patient of low blood pressure; control group: three patients of dry cough; one patient of gastrointestinal reactions, one patient of hypokalemia; four patients of low blood pressure), three studies (Qian et al., 2021; Guo, 2012; Han et al., 2011) had no adverse reactions during the course of treatment.

The bias risk of the included studies is presented in Figures 2, 3. Of the nine included RCTs, one study (Yu, 2013) was deemed to have a high RoB, while eight studies (Xie et al., 2023; Guan et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2021; Qian et al., 2021; Wang, 2018; Shi, 2014; Guo, 2012; Han et al., 2011) raised some concerns regarding the overall RoB assessment. The trial with a high RoB only mentioned randomization without providing detailed information, and it did not utilize clearly defined, objective outcome measures. We found that the third domain (Measurement of the outcome) assessing all nine trials was at low risk. However, there were some concerns identified in the assessment of the second domain (Deviations from intended interventions), primarily due to the lack of detailed mention of the use of blinding in the text. Overall, we consider the risk of bias in the nine studies to be low, as there were no significant differences observed in outcome measurements between groups and all study data were complete.FIGURE 2Risk of bias summary.FIGURE 3Risk of bias graph.3.4 Efficacy analyses of PQS for heart failure3.4.1 Primary outcomes3.4.1.1 Left ventricular ejection fractions (LVEF)LVEF is a measure of the systolic function of the heart (Baman and Ahmad, 2020). It was reported by eight studies. Random-effects models were used to analyze pooled data (n = 888, MD = 6.23, 95% CI [4.35, 8.12], P < 0.00001) for significant heterogeneous distribution (P < 0.00001, I2 = 83%). Meta-analysis showed that PQS combined with routine anti-HF drug treatments improved LVEF more than routine anti-HF drug treatment. We divided into two groups for subgroup analysis according to different treatment durations (≤12 weeks and >12 weeks). Both subgroups improved LVEF. Meta-analysis under the random-effects model showed that the LVEF was significantly higher than that of the control group (Figure 4).FIGURE 4Meta-analysis of the effects of PQS on LVEF.3.4.1.2 BNP/NT-pro-BNPIn five studies, BNP or NT-pro-BNP was evaluated. The results showed significant heterogeneity among these studies (P < 0.00001, I2 = 99%). The results of meta-analysis under a random-effects model showed that BNP or NT-pro-BNP was lower in the PQS groups (n = 612, MD = −187.94, 95% CI [−267.20, −108.67], P < 0.00001) (Figure 5A).FIGURE 5Effects of PQS on (A) BNP/NT-pro-BNP, (B) 6-min walk test distance (6MWTD).3.4.1.3 6-min walk test distance (6MWTD)6MWTD (measurement unit: meter) was evaluated in three studies. The meta-analysis under a random-effects model showed no significant heterogeneity (P = 0.49, I2 = 0%). The intervention group demonstrated a significant increase in 6MWTD compared to the control group (n = 272, MD = 25.26, 95% CI [8.23, 42.30], P = 0.004). This suggests that PQS therapy may improve exercise tolerance in HF patients (Figure 5B).3.4.2 Secondary outcomes3.4.2.1 LVEDVLVEDV was reported in three studies. Random-effects models were used to analyze data (MD = −22.83, 95% CI [−42.79, −2.87], P = 0.02) for significant heterogeneity (P = 0.0003, I2 = 88%). Meta-analysis showed that PQS preparation was more significant in reducing LVEDV (Figure 6A).FIGURE 6Meta-analysis of the effects of PQS on (A) LVEDV, (B) LVEDD, (C) LVESV.3.4.2.2 LVEDDLVEDD (measurement unit: millimeter) was reported in three studies. The meta-analysis under a random-effects model showed no significant heterogeneity (P = 0.35, I2 = 6%). The PQS group exhibited a significant reduction in LVEDD compared to the control group (n = 390, MD = −4.76, 95% CI [−5.77, −3.74], P < 0.00001), indicating improved cardiac remodeling (Figure 6B).3.4.2.3 LVESVLVESV (measurement unit: milliliter) was reported in two studies. The meta-analysis under a random-effects model showed no significant heterogeneity (P = 0.71, I2 = 0%). The PQS group demonstrated a significant reduction in LVESV compared to the control group (n = 196, MD = −11.86, 95% CI [−19.89, −3.83], P = 0.004), further supporting the beneficial effects of PQS on cardiac function (Figure 6C).3.4.2.4 Adverse eventsAmong the nine included studies, only one (Guan et al., 2023) provided detailed information on adverse events, three mentioned that no adverse events occurred, and the remaining studies did not report on adverse events. The observed adverse events included dry cough, gastrointestinal reactions, hypokalemia, and hypotension. A total of eight patients occurred adverse events in the intervention group (two patients with dry cough, three patients with gastrointestinal reactions, two patients of hypokalemia; one patient with hypotension), and their overall incidence of adverse events was 20%, but a total of nine patients occurred in the control group (three patients of dry cough; one patient of gastrointestinal reactions, one patient of hypokalemia; four patients of low blood pressure), for an overall adverse event rate of 22.5%. However, the study did not report the severity of adverse events in detail. The adverse events are in detail in Table 1.3.5 Sensitivity analysisIn our meta-analysis, significant heterogeneity was found in the comparisons of LVEF, BNP/NT-proBNP, and LVEDV. However, due to the limited number of included studies, we only conducted a series of sensitivity tests on those with more than five studies to ensure the robustness of our findings. The leave-one-out analysis showed that the heterogeneity of BNP/NT-pro-BNP remained unchanged regardless of which study was excluded (P < 0.00001, I2 = 99%) and the direction of the overall effect for BNP/NT-pro-BNP remained consistent, indicating that no single study had a disproportionate influence on the results. For LVEF, excluding one study (Shi, 2014) reduced heterogeneity (I2 from 83% to 67%) but did not significantly alter the overall effect size. Thus, the results of this analysis strengthen the robustness of our conclusions.3.6 Publication biasAs the number of included studies was too insufficient with no more than 10, the assessment of publication bias may be imprecise and meaningless. Therefore, we did not assess overall publication bias.3.7 GRADE ratingGRADEpro was used to assess these outcomes’ evidence certainty. The certainty of LVEDD was moderate, while the certainty of LVEF, BNP/NT-proBNP, 6MWTD, and LVESV were low. Additionally, the certainty of evidence was very low for LVEDV. The GRADE assessment of the evidence for outcomes are shown in Table 2.TABLE 2Quality of evidence.Quality assessmentNo of patientsEffectQualityImportanceNo of studiesDesignRisk of biasInconsistencyIndirectnessImprecisionOther considerationsLVEFControlRelative (95% CI)AbsoluteLVEF (Better indicated by lower values)8Randomised trialsSeriousSeriousNo serious indirectnessNo serious imprecisionNone442446-MD 6.23 higher (4.35 to 8.12 higher)⊕⊕ΟΟLOWCRITICALBNP/NT-pro-BNP (Better indicated by lower values)5Randomised trialsSeriousSeriousNo serious indirectnessNo serious imprecisionNone303309-MD 187.94 lower (267.2 to 108.67 lower)⊕⊕ΟΟLOWCRITICAL6MWTD (Better indicated by lower values)3Randomised trialsSeriousNo serious inconsistencyNo serious indirectnessSeriousNone137135-MD 25.26 higher (8.23 to 42.3 higher)⊕⊕ΟΟLOWCRITICALLVEDV (Better indicated by lower values)3Randomised trialsSeriousSeriousNo serious indirectnessSeriousNone174172-MD 22.83 lower (42.79 to 2.87 lower)⊕ΟΟΟVERY LOWCRITICALLVEDD (Better indicated by lower values)3Randomised trialsSeriousNo serious inconsistencyNo serious indirectnessNo serious imprecisionNone195195-MD 4.76 lower (5.77 to 3.74 lower)⊕⊕⊕ΟMODERATECRITICALLVESV (Better indicated by lower values)2Randomised trialsSeriousNo serious inconsistencyNo serious indirectnessSeriousNone9997-MD 11.86 lower (19.89 to 3.83 lower)⊕⊕ΟΟLOWCRITICAL4 DiscussionPQ is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Araliaceae family. PQS are its primary active constituents, and research suggests that PQS may be beneficial for cardiovascular diseases, with its protective effects mainly attributed to its antioxidant properties (Lu et al., 2023). Furthermore, previous studies have indicated that PQS can reduce the adverse effects of cardiac damage induced by anti-cancer drug (cisplatin) (Xing et al., 2019) and also provide protection against cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury (Ma et al., 2017). The stems and leaves of American ginseng can be harvested from September to October each year, and PQS extracted from these stems and leaves has the advantage of lower cost (Zhang et al., 2022). Currently, in China, the only Chinese Proprietary Medicine approved for marketing containing PQS is Xinyue Capsules. Therefore, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the efficacy and safety of PQS preparations for HF using systematic review and meta-analysis methods.4.1 Summary of evidenceThis study identified a total of nine RCTs, encompassing 952 HF patients, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PQS for HF. Significant differences in clinical efficacy were observed across all PQS groups, with improvements noted in patients’ cardiac function. Meta-analysis results from eight RCTs indicated that PQS for HF led to enhanced cardiac function and improved clinical symptoms and signs, with statistically significant differences (P < 0.05).The systematic review showed that compared to conventional therapy alone, the combination of PQS and conventional treatment significantly improved LVEF, 6MWTD and reduced BNP/NT-pro-BNP, LVEDV, LVEDD, and LVESV with HF patients. Utilizing the GRADEpro, we assessed the quality of evidence for these outcomes, with four outcome measures rated as low, one as moderate, and another as very low. The findings of this review suggested that PQS combined with conventional therapy not only improves cardiac function and reduces cardiac load but also enhances exercise tolerance and elevates the quality of life among patients, demonstrating superior efficacy over conventional therapy. However, heterogeneity was detected in the examination of LVEF, BNP/NT-pro-BNP, LVEDV, and LVEDD outcomes. Consequently, we conducted subgroup analyses solely on LVEF, focusing on studies with larger sample sizes, based on treatment duration. The subgroup analysis revealed non-significant heterogeneity for treatments lasting less than 12 weeks but significant heterogeneity within subgroups exceeding 12 weeks. Additionally, potential sources of heterogeneity, such as small sample sizes, variations in age, gender, duration of disease, and the presence of comorbidities, could introduce bias and compromise the reliability of the results.Only one trial compared the incidence rates of adverse reactions between two groups. Although the incidence rate of adverse reactions in the PQS treatment group was slightly lower than that in the control group, the difference was not statistically significant. The study also provided specific clinical manifestations of adverse events, with dry cough, gastrointestinal reactions, hypokalemia, and hypotension being common adverse reactions. However, since both the intervention group and the control group received conventional drug therapy, which included diuretics and RASI (ARB/ACEI), these drugs themselves may lead to similar adverse reactions such as hypotension and hypokalemia. Therefore, it is difficult to determine whether these adverse events were solely caused by PQS or side effects of other conventional medications. Additionally, three trials did not observe any adverse reactions or side effects. Hence, the safety of PQS for HF is currently difficult to ascertain.4.2 LimitationsOur study results consistently demonstrated that adding PQS preparations to conventional anti-HF medications significantly improved clinical efficacy, enhanced cardiac function, and thus improved the quality of life of patients, with no apparent adverse effects. However, this review has the following several limitations. Firstly, due to the inclusion of a limited number of trials, and the generally poor methodological quality of most, along with heterogeneity in some outcome measures, the persuasive power of the meta-analysis results may be somewhat limited. Secondly, all intervention groups received PQS in combination with conventional medication. Thus, it remains unclear whether the efficacy of PQS was influenced by interactions with conventional drugs. Thirdly, although all included studies were RCTs, the GRADE assessment revealed that the quality of evidence for some outcomes was low or very low. This was primarily due to the following reasons: due to some studies (Han et al., 2011; Guo, 2012; Shi, 2014; Wang, 2018) lacked specific descriptions regarding the generation of random sequences, concealment of randomization, blinding procedures, etc. These problems increase the risk of bias and reduce the reliability of the study results. In addition, significant heterogeneity was observed in LVEF, BNP/NT-pro-BNP, and LVEDV outcomes and could not be explained by subgroup analysis. Thus, there was significant inconsistency in LVEF, BNP/NT-pro-BNP, and LVEDV outcomes. Moreover, the large SD of one study (Han et al., 2011) included in the 6MWTD, LVEDV, and LVESV analyses, as well as the small number of studies and small sample sizes used for the analyses, resulted in wide MD 95% CI. These issues contributed to the imprecision of the studies. Fourthly, all included RCTs were conducted in China with Chinese participants, making it difficult to ascertain the influence of ethnicity and region, which may limit the generalizability of the results. Fifthly, because the original RCT studies included did not provide detailed data on reported efficacy stratified by age, gender, and HF severity, it was not possible to explore differences in response to PQS in different patient groups. Furthermore, there was a lack of descriptions of adverse reactions of PQS. Hence, conclusions regarding adverse reactions remain inconclusive, necessitating further observation of its safety profile.4.3 Suggestions for future clinical researchWhile our systematic review and meta-analysis results showed that PQS is safe and effective in the treatment of HF, there was a high degree of heterogeneity in some outcomes and methodological limitations inherent in the RCTs included. Therefore, its safety and efficacy should be approached with caution. In the future, we recommend conducting high-quality RCTs with large sample sizes, multicenter involvement, double-blinding, and placebo controls to confirm the efficacy and safety of PQS for HF. Additionally, it is advisable to register trial protocols before conducting clinical research and to rigorously monitor adverse reactions during the study. Researchers should also not overlook assessing the interaction effects of PQS when used in conjunction with conventional HF medications, whether beneficial or adverse, in order to make a reasonable assessment of the safety of the drug. Furthermore, since the study participants were all Chinese, international research could be pursued in the future. In addition, to address the limitations in the GRADE assessment and to improve the quality of evidence from future studies, we suggest that future clinical research should prioritize rigorous study designs, including adequate randomization, blinding, and allocation concealment, to minimize the risk of bias. At the same time, increased sample sizes are needed to improve the precision of effect estimates and enhance the statistical power of analyses. For future research, we should also prioritize the collection and reporting of subgroup data to identify which populations may benefit most from PQS therapy. Lastly, we observed that all included trials lacked long-term follow-up and did not report long-term benefits. Therefore, future research should evaluate the long-term effects of PQS preparations for HF treatment, such as HF progression, HF readmission rates, 3-year survival rates, 5-year survival rates, and mortality events. We will continue to monitor this study closely.5 ConclusionThe evidence provided by this systematic review suggests that adjunctive PQS therapy for HF can improve clinical efficacy and hold potential advantages in improving cardiac function and increasing exercise tolerance. However, given the limitations inherent in this review and the results of the GRADE assessment, the conclusions of this study should be interpreted cautiously. Therefore, in clinical practice, it is recommended that physicians tailor treatment strategies according to the specific circumstances of individual patients. Furthermore, it is advised to conduct further high-quality RCTs with large sample sizes, multicenter involvement, double-blinding, placebo controls, and long-term follow-up to provide robust clinical evidence support for the efficacy and safety of PQS for HF."}
{"PMCID": "12255165", "title": "A comparative analysis of conduction system pacing and biventricular pacing in patients undergoing atrioventricular node ablation: a systematic review and meta-analysis", "abstract": "AbstractAimsAtrioventricular node ablation (AVNA) with permanent pacemaker implantation is an established rate-control treatment approach for patients with AF with uncontrolled ventricular rates. Conduction system pacing (CSP) utilizing His bundle pacing (HBP) or left bundle branch area pacing (LBBAP) has advanced as a treatment alternative to standard right ventricular pacing in addition to biventricular pacing (BVP). This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to provide a comprehensive summary and evaluation of clinical outcomes in the literature for CSP in comparison to BVP in conjunction with AVNA.Methods and resultsThis study protocol was registered in the PROSPERO registry (CRD42024510974), and the review was conducted as per the PRISMA guidelines. Databases were searched for relevant studies from inception till 11 January 2024. Results were synthesized using a random effects meta-analysis. From a total of 259 references identified, 122 full texts were assessed, and 25 studies were included in the systematic review. Of these included studies, five were used for comparative meta-analysis. A total of 1652 (HBP 1069 and LBBAP 644) and 369 patients received CSP and BVP implantation with AVNA, respectively. Conduction system pacing resulted in a narrower QRS duration (QRSd) with a change of −35.8 ms (95% CI −61.8 to −9.72; P < 0.05; I2 = 96.3%) vs. BVP. Conduction system pacing also resulted in better symptomatic improvement in from of NYHA reduction (MD −0.53, 95% CI −1.01 to −0.04, I2 = 62.1; P = 0.03). For left ventricular ejection fraction, a non-significant weighted mean increases of 3.36% (95% CI −0.75–7.47%; P = 0.11, I2 = 68.5%) was observed following CSP implantation in comparison to BVP. Conduction system pacing showed no significant differences in procedural and fluoroscopy times and had comparable periprocedural complications. His bundle pacing demonstrated a non-significant reduction in the events of acute threshold elevation in comparison to BVP (Log odds ratio −0.69, 95% CI −2.05–0.66, I2 = 0.00; P = 0.32).ConclusionConduction system pacing with AVNA is a safe and feasible treatment option for symptomatic (AF) patients undergoing a pace and ablate strategy, offering an alternative to BVP. Overall, CSP results in a narrower QRS duration while providing comparable clinical and echocardiographic outcomes.", "body": "IntroductionAtrial fibrillation (AF) is a highly prevalent and clinically significant arrhythmia that is associated with increased morbidity and mortality.1,2 AF and heart failure (HF) are particularly linked, as both share common risk factors and potentiate the risk and severity of one another.3,4Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have observed similar efficacy with rate vs. rhythm control strategies for treatment of AF.5,6 Catheter ablation remains a key strategy for rhythm control in patients with symptomatic atrial fibrillation who do not respond to antiarrhythmic medications or as a first-line option in a selected group of patients. However, some patients may not be suitable candidates for rhythm control due to comorbidities, while others continue to experience symptoms despite multiple ablation attempts. Therefore, pharmacotherapy constitutes a significant proponent of available approaches for rate-control strategy. Atrioventricular node ablation (AVNA) with subsequent pacing is the last and solid treatment modality for patients with AF exhibiting symptoms and high ventricular rates refractory to pharmacological management. The AHA/ACC/HRS Atrial Fibrillation Practise Guidelines (2014) recommend AVNA with permanent right ventricular pacing (RVP) as a class IIa evidence for rate control in AF when pharmacological strategies are inadequate and rhythm control cannot be attained.7 Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) through biventricular pacing (BVP) is considered for patients exhibiting a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), which are referred for AVNA.7 CRT has also demonstrated potential benefit in candidates referred for AVNA with a narrow QRS complex as the APAF-CRT trial reported improved outcomes with regard to hospitalization and quality of life (QOL) in comparison to pharmacotherapy.8Conduction system pacing (CSP) has emerged as an alternative to RVP and BVP through recruitment of the innate conduction pathways.9–15 This approach results in greater physiological activation and cardiac synchrony to attain improved pacing and clinical outcomes.16 Current modalities for CSP include His bundle pacing (HBP), where leads are implanted in the His bundle, and left bundle branch area pacing (LBBAP), where leads are positioned in the interventricular septum to enable left bundle branch capture (Figure 1). The advancement of CSP implantation in addition to the growing body of evidence has led to the synthesis of recommendations and guidance surrounding CSP in recently released clinical guidelines. The 2023 HRS/APHRS/LAHRS guidelines on Cardiac Physiologic Pacing provided recommendations on patients undergoing pacemaker implant who are expected to require substantial ventricular pacing (≥20–40%) may be considered for Cardiac Physiologic Pacing CPP (this includes BIV or CSP) class 2a to reduce the risk of pacing-induced cardiomyopathy. It also recommended the use of CPP in patients with normal EF who will require substantial RV pacing class 2b.17 It is understandable that patients undergoing AVNA will require almost 100% pacing.Figure 1Mechanisms of conduction system pacing.Studies have reported feasibility and improved electrocardiographic and echocardiographic outcomes for HBP when implemented with AVNA.18,19 Additionally, studies evaluating LBBAP and AVNA have also reported feasibility and positive outcomes corresponding to safety and threshold values.20–22 However, there are overall only few RCTs directly comparing CSP with BVP and therefore, limited robust evidence to immediately determine whether CSP could be an efficacious alternative to BVP for facilitating a pace and ablate strategy with AVNA. There is limited prospective and randomized data on CSP and AVNA that evaluating the efficacy of CSP with AVNA compared to BVP with only one prior meta-analysis primarily focused on HBP.23 Hence, we conducted an updated systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate and compare clinical outcomes for patients receiving CSP or BVP, with AVNA.MethodsThe Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were adhered to in the conducting of this systematic review and meta-analysis. The systematic review protocol was published a priori on PROSPERO. The registration number is CRD42024510974.Data sources and searchesPubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched from 1983 to 23 January 2024. The complete search strategies are fully described in the Supplementary Digital Content S1. The bibliographies of similar and related systematic reviewers also searched along with the reference sections of included studies. Only articles written in English were considered.Study selectionRandomized control trials, non-randomized control trials, case–control studies, cohort studies, retrospective studies, and cross-sectional studies that included patients with AF that underwent treatment with CSP and AVNA were eligible for this review. Studies that conveyed primary and/or secondary outcome variables in addition to the above were included. Four reviewers (A.M., A.M.A., K.A., I.K.) independently screened the retrieved articles for eligibility following deduplication by title and abstract. Any conflicts were resolved by discussion with a fifth reviewer (M.I.).Primary and secondary outcomesThe primary outcome was LVEF on follow-up and post-procedural QRS duration. Secondary outcomes included procedural success, periprocedural adverse events, pacing thresholds on implant and at follow-up, incidence of lead revision, New York Heart Association (NYHA) score on follow-up, incidence of HF associated hospitalization, and incidence of all-cause mortality.Data extraction and quality assessmentTwo reviewers (A.M. and S.S.) independently extracted data from the included studies. Study characteristics collated included authors, year of study, county of study, study methodology, number and specific CSP modalities, and presence of control population. Sample population characteristics included sample size, mean age (SD), gender distribution, body mass index, prevalence of comorbidities, classification of AF [paroxysmal AF (PAF), persistent AF, or permanent AF], and previous AF management received (electrical cardioversion, catheter ablation). Baseline electrocardiographic and echocardiographic features were also collated in addition to the NYHA classification, NT-pro-BNP levels, and mean number of HF associated hospitalizations per patient. Primary outcomes collated included follow-up LVEF and QRS duration following device implantation. Secondary outcome data included periprocedural outcomes (procedural success, procedural time, fluoroscopy time, type of device implantation including any backup RV lead and atrial lead, and pacing parameters). Procedural details corresponding to unsuccessful implantations and periprocedural adverse events were recorded. Outcomes collated from follow-up data included LV end-diastolic volume index (LVEDVi), LV end-systolic volume index (LVESVi), NYHA, tricuspid regurgitation (TR) grade, and loop diuretic usage, and HF associated hospitalization were noted. Outcomes corresponding to AVNA such as time of AVNA relative to CSP implantation, procedural success, acute threshold increase, and loss of AV block were collated. Any discrepancies between two reviewers were arbitrated by a third reviewer (M.I.) and resolved by consensus. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was applied to assess individual study methodological quality.24Risk of bias in individual studiesRisk of bias was assessed by 2 reviewers (A.M., R.C.) using the RoB 2 and ROBINS-I tool.25,26 Disparities between investigators were resolved following discussion with a third reviewer (M.I.) until consensus reached.Stata analysisOutcome measures were continuous (QRSd, LVEF, NYHA, pacing thresholds) and binary (HF associated hospitalization and all-cause mortality). Data were analysed using a two-group comparison of continuous outcomes using random effects modelling with a restricted maximum likelihood method. Two group comparisons of binary outcomes were conducted with the Mantel–Haenszel model. Continuous were compared between patients who received CSP and BVP and were reported as a pooled mean difference with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Binary outcomes were reported as odds ratios with a 95% CI. Statistical heterogeneity was quantified using I2 statistic, where I2 > 60% was considered significant, moderate for I2 if between 30% and 60%, and a low if I2 < 30%. Substudy analysis was performed between CSP and BVP, HBP and BVP, LBBAP and BVP, and HBP and LBBAP. Analysis of heterogeneity was performed with sensitivity and subgroup analysis of the population. Publication bias was assessed using the Egger test and visually estimated with funnel plots. To explore potential sources of heterogeneity, meta-regression was applied to test the influence of mean age, male proportion, baseline LVEF, and baseline QRSd. Statistical analysis was performed with the Metan module in Stata Version 17 (© 2021 StataCorp LLC, USA).ResultsLiterature searchThe search retrieved 259 studies results of which 15 duplicate records were manually removed. Following title and abstract review, 137 were excluded. Of the remaining 122 full text articles, 97 were excluded for the specified reasons illustrated in Figure 2. The remaining 26 studies were included.18–22,27–46 Five of the included studies were utilized for meta-analysis.18,20,30,31,45 The overall quality of the studies using the GRADE approach was moderate.Figure 2PRISMA flow diagram.Characteristics of the included studiesDetailed patient characteristics are presented in Table 1.

A total of 49 cases were converted from an initially intended HBP implantation to LBBAP, while 10 cases of planned LBBAP were converted to left septal pacing (LSP). Backup RV lead insertion was documented in 871 cases while atrial lead implantation was conducted in 306 cases. CSP implantation procedural time ranged from 34 to 120 min while fluoroscopy duration ranged from 4.5 to 18 min. Conduction system pacing was facilitated through a range of devices ranging from single chamber PPM to biventricular ICD (Table 4). Procedural pacing parameters corresponding to pacing threshold, impedance, QRS duration, and R wave characteristics are presented in Table 5. Documented reasons for unsuccessful HBP and LBBAP implantation failure are presented in Table 6. Acute periprocedural adverse events were documented in 23 cases of CSP implantation (2.15%) with no events of periprocedural mortality observed (Table 6). Acute threshold elevation was observed in 34 cases of HBP implantation (3.22%) while none were noted in the LBBAP pooled cohort (Table 6). Lead repositioning following acute threshold changes was required in six cases (0.69%).Table 4Conduction system pacing periprocedural details and outcomesStudySpecified interventionSuccessful

successfully implemented in 1594 patients (99.1%) with 1333 cases specified to have been performed at the time of CSP implantation (84.6%). For cases with AVNA not performed during CSP implantation, the time interval between procedures generally ranged from 2 to 6 weeks.A total of 369 patients were specified to have successfully received BVP. Fluoroscopy duration ranged from 14 to 23.5 min.Improvement in LVEFConduction system pacing demonstrated a non-significant improvement in LVEF compared to BVP by ∼3.36% (MD 3.36, 95% CI −0.75–7.47 I2 = 68.5; P = 0.11)18,20,30,31,45 (Figure 3). Overall, the rest of the included studies that were not incorporated in the meta-analysis also demonstrated an improvement in LVEF on follow-up (Table 7, Supplementary material online, Table S4). The improvement in LVEF was even more accentuated in studies that reported specific patient populations with impaired LVEF.19,21,27–29,35,41,42 Meta-analysis for this specific cohort of LV impairment could not be pursued as majority of these studies did not include a comparator BVP cohort.Figure 3Change in LVEF - CSP vs. BVP.Table 7Conduction system pacing—outcomes on follow-upStudySpecified

a significant reduction in NYHA class in comparison to BVP (MD −0.53, 95% CI −1.01 to −0.04, I2 = 62.1; P = 0.03).30,31,45 Overall, the rest of the included studies that could not be incorporated in the meta-analysis also demonstrated an improvement in NYHA on F/U.19,21,22,27,32,33,35,41,43,44HospitalizationCSP demonstrated a non-significant reduction in hospitalization when also compared to BVP (Log odds ratio −0.49, 95% CI −1.83–0.84, I2 = 0.00; P = 0.47). From the included studies reporting HF associated hospitalization on F/U, a pooled total of 100 events was observed.18–22,27–30,33,37,41,43,47MortalitySimilarly, CSP demonstrated a non-significant reduction in mortality when compared to BVP (Log odds ratio −0.80, 95% CI −2.19–0.59, I2 = 3.80; P = 0.26). Of the included studies reporting outcomes on all-cause mortality, a pooled total of 101 events was observed19–22,27–33,38,39,41,43,46 (Table 7).Follow-up pacing thresholdsThe overall increase in pacing thresholds on follow-up was similar for HBP in comparison to BVP (MD −0.03, 95% CI −0.18 to −0.12, I2 = 0.00; P = 0.70).18,30,31,45 Follow-up thresholds for LBBAP were significantly lower in comparison to BVP (MD −0.55, 95% CI −0.72 to −0.39, I2 = 0.00; P < 0.05).18,20,31Acute thresholdsHis bundle pacing demonstrated a non-significant reduction in the events of acute threshold elevation in comparison to BVP (Log odds ratio −0.69, 95% CI −2.05–0.66, I2 = 0.00; P = 0.32).30,31Left ventricular dimensionsStudy findings indicated that CSP resulted in a reduction of left ventricle end-systolic and end-diastolic dimensions at follow-up (see Supplementary material online, Table S5).21,28–33,38,41–45Further analysisHis bundle pacing demonstrated a non-significant increase in LVEF compared to BVP by 3.49% (MD 3.49, 95% CI −0.56–7.55; I2 = 65.9%; P = 0.09),18,20,30,31,45 while LBBAP demonstrated similar outcomes to BVP (MD −0.04, 95% CI −2.01–1.93; I2 = 0.00; P = 0.97)18,20,31 (Figure 5). Subgrouping according to mean baseline LVEF revealed a non-significant improvement in LVEF for CSP in comparison to BVP [LVEF < 40: (MD 7.07, 95% CI 1.37–12.8; I2 = 28.7%, P = 0.24); LVEF > 40: (MD 1.13, 95% CI −3.02–5.27; I2 = 65.5, P = 0.08)]. His bundle pacing exhibited similar outcomes of LVEF with LBBAP (MD 1.65, 95% CI −2.45–5.76; I2 = 0.00%; P = 0.86).18,20,31Figure 5Change in LVEF - Subanalysis - HBP and LBBAP.The HBP group demonstrated a greater reduction in paced QRS duration compared to BVP (MD −35.2, 95% CI −63.7 to −6.76, I2 = 96.5; P < 0.05).18,20,30,31,45 Left bundle branch area pacing also demonstrated a greater reduction when compared to BVP (MD −27.4, 95% CI −52.5 to −2.17, I2 = 90.1; P < 0.05).18,20,31 There was minimal difference in paced QRS duration outcomes between HBP and LBBAP (MD 1.70, 95% CI −16.6–20.0, I2 = 83.5; P = 0.86).18,20,31Analysis revealed a statistically significant improvement in NYHA class for HBP in comparison to BVP (MD −0.55, 95% CI −1.06 to −0.04, I2 = 66.5; P = 0.04).30,31,45 Analysis could not be performed for the LBBAP intervention as only one included study reported NYHA outcomes for the LBBAP cohort.Analysis revealed a significant reduction in elevated thresholds for LBBAP in comparison to BVP (MD −0.55, 95% CI −0.72 to −0.39, I2 = 0.00; P < 0.05). His bundle pacing did not demonstrate any significant differences to BVP (MD −0.03, 95% CI −0.18–0.12, I2 = 0.00; P = 0.70).Sensitivity analysis according to study methodology was performed with included studies divided in to RCTs and observational studies. There was a significant difference in ΔNYHA functional class between the two methodologies in favour of CSP [observational studies: MD (−)0.78 (95% CI −1.16 to −0.40, I2 = 0.00%, P < 0.05) vs. RCT: MD (−)0.08 (95% CI −0.55–0.39, P = 0.74), Qb(1) = 5.20, P = 0.02]. There were no significant differences between methodologies for ΔLVEF (Qb(1) = 0.11, P = 0.74), ΔQRSd (Qb(1) = 0.26, P = 0.61), ΔHFH (Qb(1) = 0.05, P = 0.82), value of acute thresholds (Qb(1) = 0.64, P = 0.42), and thresholds on follow-up (Qb(1) = 0.04, P = 0.85).Meta-regressionTo explore potential sources of heterogeneity, meta-regression was applied to the test the influence of mean age, male proportion, baseline LVEF, and baseline QRSd (see Supplementary material online, Table S6). Baseline QRSd contributed significantly to heterogeneity for change in LVEF (P = 0.0490) and change in QRSd (P = 0.0470). Mean age and male proportion contributed significantly to heterogeneity for change in NYHA.Quality assessment and publication biasThe outcomes of the risk of bias assessment for each study are shown in Figure 2. Of the randomized studies, one study demonstrated some concerns of bias.30 Of the non-randomized studies, 2 studies demonstrated low risk of bias,43,47 13 studies demonstrated some concerns,18,19,22,27–29,32,33,35,37,40–42 and 9 studies exhibited high risk of bias.20,21,31,34,36,38,39,44,45The funnel plot for change in LVEF, QRSd, and NYHA class for CSP vs. BVP showed an asymmetrical distribution of similar weight studies (see Supplementary material online, Figure S1). The Egger regression test was performed and revealed evidence of significant publication bias (P = 0.0115) for QRSd; however, no evidence of significant bias was observed for change in LVEF (P = 0.119) and NYHA (P = 0.619).DiscussionThe findings from this systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrate that CSP can be implemented successfully with AVNA and may result in improvements in LV function and dimensions compared to conventional BVP. The extent of QRS narrowing, as a measure of electrical synchronization, was more favourable after CSP implantation. Furthermore, patients that underwent CSP demonstrated a trend of better clinical outcomes in the context of NYHA classification along with reduced HFH in comparison to BVP. With respect to periprocedural outcomes, there were no significant differences observed in procedural and fluoroscopy times. Additionally, CSP demonstrated a similar periprocedural complication and subacute adverse event rate. Certain findings were consistent with the meta-analysis performed by Xu et al.23 although there were also notable differences in outcomes. Xu et al.23 reported a significant improvement in LVEF and QRSd for HBP, however, in combination with a lower procedural success rate in addition to more complications. This contrasted with this review’s findings where 95.9% of HBP procedures were successfully facilitated and complication rates were significantly lower. This might be due to the fact that we included more studies and patients than the previous study. While further clinical trials of CSP with AVNA are awaited, this review highlights notable implications for clinical practice and future research.The application of AVNA with permanent pacing strategies has emerged as an effective therapeutic approach for improving symptoms and quality of life in patients experiencing AF with rapid ventricular rates refractory to other treatment modalities.48 AHA/ACC/HRS Atrial Fibrillation Practise Guidelines (2014) recommend consideration of AVNA with permanent RVP in patients exhibiting AF with high ventricular rates when pharmacological therapy is suboptimal and rhythm control cannot be attained (class IIa, level of evidence B).7 While effective rate control derived from AVNA significantly addresses symptoms, the chronic deleterious effects of RVP in patients with impaired LV function have encouraged the search for alternative pacing modalities. The use of BVP with AVNA was associated with a reduction in heart failure associated mortality and HFH along with an improvement in QOL and LVEF, when compared with RVP.48,49 Delayed left ventricular activation with a present left bundle branch block may result in unfavourable physiology in patients with HF. While long-term studies have demonstrated the reduction in morbidity and mortality through BVP, implant of the left ventricular lead is not always feasibility and in certain patient populations, BVP may only provide modest correct in QRS and ventricular activation time.17,50,51 as well as a recognized non-response rate to BVP in CRT patients. As a result, CSP has emerged as a potential alternative with Deshmukh et al.52 first reporting feasibility for the HBP approach in 2000. Further studies have followed on and demonstrated feasibility and efficacy in improving echocardiographic outcomes and functional capacity.53–55 Sharma et al.56 demonstrated the effectiveness of HBP as a rescue approach for patients exhibiting failed coronary sinus lead implantation or suboptimal/non-response to BVP. In spite of the modest crossover rates from HBP to BVP, Vinther et al.57 reported a significant increase in LVEF with CSP in the per-protocol analysis. In consideration of HBP limitations, Huang et al. proposed the LBBAP approach as it presented certain technical advantages including lower thresholds, application for more distal diseases, and a faster learning curve. An RCT conducted by Vijayaraman et al.58 demonstrated a significant increase in LVEF when patients were randomized to either HBP or LBBAP instead of BVP. In spite of the technical advantages LBBAP confers, a study published by Ali et al.59 published findings suggesting a lesser degree of physiological ventricular activation. Several meta-analysis have also reinforced the consensus from the observational studies and controlled trials by demonstrating findings of superior echocardiographic and functionality outcomes in comparison to BVP.9,60–62Recent observational studies have demonstrated findings suggestive of feasibility and efficacy for HBP and LBBAP when performed in conjunction with AVNA.19,21,31,41 These studies have demonstrated that CSP with AVNA is associated with improved echocardiographic outcomes, maintenance of physiologic ventricular activation, and functional outcomes. The findings from this meta-analysis have potentially reinforced this hypothesis as non-significant improvements in LVEF along with QRS narrowing in comparison to BVP were evident. While the improvement in LVEF was not statistically significant, it is important to note that there was heterogeneity in patient allocation to the respective treatment groups. The study conducted by Vijayaram et al. 2022 was the only included study to demonstrate a superior improvement in LVEF for BVP in comparison to CSP; however, the authors reported a significant discrepancy in baseline LVEF between the BVP and CSP cohorts.20 The BVP cohort exhibited a baseline LVEF of 26.7 ± 10.5% in a significant contrast to the CSP cohort that exhibited an LVEF of 46.5 ± 14.2%. This would likely affect the degree of possible improvement in LVEF and thus the comparisons between the two cohorts may not truly be reflective of their real efficacy. The exclusion of the study from the meta-analysis resulted in a mean difference of 4.57% (95% CI −0.06–9.20, I2 = 69.0, P = 0.05) for improvement in LVEF between CSP and BVP.The improvement in LVEF was even more pronounce in patients with severely impaired LVEF at baseline although interestingly the association of baseline LVEF with post-procedural LVEF was not significant on meta-regression. Baseline QRSd was noted as a significant source of heterogeneity for change in LVEF and QRSd as per meta-regression.Atrioventricular node ablation can be potentially challenging especially in patients with HBP as it evokes a risk of increasing HBP thresholds when ablating near to the HBP lead.19 This systematic review observed a pooled prevalence of 34 cases with HBP and AVNA (3.22%) demonstrating acute elevation of thresholds with six cases requiring lead repositioning. Left bundle branch area pacing presents as a reliable alternative to attaining low and stable pacing thresholds, as made evident by no patients in the pooled LBBAP that sustained acute elevations in thresholds. Within the studies also including a BVP control population, three cases of acute threshold elevation were observed with one lead revision required for BVP from a total of 369 patients. In view of the concerns surrounding acute thresholds, the 2021 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) pacing guidelines recommend implantation of a backup ventricular lead in patients with HBP undergoing AVNA that is evident with the significant pooled prevalence of backup RV lead insertion in this systematic review.63 A majority of AVNA was safely performed during the CSP implantation procedure through femoral or axillary approach. The remaining cases had AVNA generally performed within 2–6 weeks with operators potentially preferring ablation in subacute setting once thresholds were confirmed to be stable. Within the studies including a conventional pacing (CP) control population, the pooled incidence of acute periprocedural adverse events not including acute threshold elevation was similar between CSP (0.529%) and CP (0.901%). These pooled observations support the application of CSP as a safe and acceptable alternative approach in patients receiving AVNA compared to CP. Additionally, the findings were consistent with the reported outcomes from the Multicentre European Left Bundle Branch Area Pacing Outcomes Study (MELOS) that also reported similar rates between the two approaches.64 There was a greater incidence of recurrence of AV node conduction in the CSP group (3.88%) compared to the CP group (1.41%). This could be explained by a reluctance to administering additional ablation for lesions for concern of increasing the HBP thresholds. The safety and efficacy of CSP with AVNA were further supported by the reduction in all-cause mortality and HFH on follow-up along with stable thresholds in comparison to BVP.Given the necessity for further prospective and comparative studies, several clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of CSP with AVNA are ongoing (CONDUCT-AF Trial, RAFT-P&A, PACE-FIB, LBBAP-AFHF).65–68 Additionally, there is interest in facilitating trials with multiple arms including pulmonary vein isolation vs. AVNA with CSP in order to compare and guide clinical practice for treatment strategies of AF. Regarding patient selection, a greater mechanistic understanding of which factors associated with AF are more detrimental to myocardial function, at both a cellular and organ level, are essential. Furthermore, the capacity to determine which patients exhibit a propensity for arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy will be highly efficacious as HF is not ubiquitous to all patients with AF. Overall, the promising preliminary findings suggest CSP’s potential to contribute to the armamentarium for AF through its ability to approximate physiological activation of the ventricles although further methodologically robust longitudinal studies are required to assess long-term safety and effectiveness.Study limitationsThis systematic review and meta-analysis exhibited numerous limitations. Several studies utilized small samples sizes along with significant differences in methodologies. Some of the studies retrieved were of lower evidence with overall limited prospective and randomized controlled trials published for this area. This was not unexpected given the relative infancy of CSP in pace and ablate strategies. While meta-analysis would ideally be conducted between studies of the same methodologies, the paucity of RCTs led to the inclusion of observational studies. As a result, sensitivity analysis was performed to examine the effect of the methodologies on the overall outcomes. Majority of the outcomes remained consistent between the methodologies aside from the change in NYHA functional classification in favour of CSP. Overall, in view of the increasing dissemination of this approach, we can anticipate the facilitation of more robust studies and trials in the future. The sample size across the included studies was generally lower with seldom use of statistical power calculation. Several studies did not facilitate a comparator arm and thus it was challenging to compare the efficacy and safety of CSP with BVP for AVNA. Moderate to severe heterogeneity was observed for majority of the outcomes evaluated with meta-analysis. This was potentially due to significant crossover between CSP therapies in the included studies as further analysis appeared to have isolated heterogeneity to either approach (HBP or LBBAP). Additionally, there was variability in reported demographics and outcomes across studies and thus further evaluation of heterogeneity through subgroup analysis and meta-regression proved challenging. Majority of studies exhibited a short follow-up period of ∼6–12 months and thus, the long-term outcomes are still to be determined. Furthermore, most of the studies were single-centre and thus the external validity of results could have been compromised. Lastly, there was significant variation in the reporting of certain outcomes such as periprocedural adverse events.ConclusionIn conclusion, the findings from our systematic review and meta-analysis conveyed superior electrocardiographic, echocardiographic, and clinical outcomes regarding functional status, and non-significant improvement in mortality and HHF for CSP in comparison to BVP. As a result, the outcomes of this meta-analysis suggest that CSP is promising alternative to BVP for facilitating pace and ablation strategies with AVNA for patients with AF. However, large scale robust controlled trials with appropriate longitudinal follow-up are required to validate the efficacy of CSP as an alternative approach to BVP in conjunction with AVNA.Supplementary Materialeuaf106_Supplementary_Data"}

The current meta‐analysis assessed the effects of an invasive strategy with intended PCI compared with conservative treatment in older people (≥80 years) with ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction.MethodsA structured literature search was performed. The primary outcome was overall survival. Secondary outcome analyses included but were not limited to 30‐day and 1‐year mortality.ResultsThirteen studies reporting on 102 158 older adults were included. Of these, 31 629 (31%) were assigned to PCI and 70 529 (69%) were treated conservatively. The overall survival was 76.5% in PCI and 67.2% in conservative treatment at the time of longest available follow‐up (odds ratio [OR], 2.18 [95% CI, 1.79–2.66], P<0.001, I\n2=88%, favoring PCI). The follow‐up period ranged from 30 days to 26.5 months. The 30‐day.

PCI was advantageous in short‐ and long‐term survival, but these results were affected by confounding. Nonetheless, every second patient not referred for invasive treatment survived at least 1 year. These findings have hypothesis generating implications, but they indicate ageism and emphasize that PCI should not be automatically withheld in older patients.", "body": "Nonstandard Abbreviations and AcronymsCONconservative treatmentNRSInonrandomized controlled studies of interventionsRoBrisk of bias\nClinical PerspectiveWhat Is New?\nThis meta‐analysis indicates a potential underuse of primary percutaneous coronary intervention in older adults with ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction; only one third of older patients were triaged to percutaneous coronary intervention.As expected, percutaneous coronary intervention was advantageous in short‐ and long‐term survival, but even every second older patient who was conservatively treated was a long‐term survivor; this calls into question the ad hoc triage decision.This practice might indicate ageism.\nWhat Are the Clinical Implications?\nReal‐world data from registries and observational studies indicate that percutaneous coronary intervention should not be automatically withheld in older patients.Patient triaged to conservative treatment might also be long‐term survivors.\n\nCardiovascular diseases and particularly ischemic heart disease significantly contribute to morbidity and reduce longevity of octogenarians, nonagenarians, and centenarians.\n1\n Even though the incidence of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) decreased within the past 2 decades among the general population,\n2\n, \n3\n, \n4\n longer estimated life spans contribute to a considerable number of AMIs in those older adults.\n5\n, \n6\n Although recent evidence in older patients with non‐ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction (non‐STEMI) demonstrated that invasive management does not result in improved survival compared with conservative treatment,\n7\n, \n8\n, \n9\n older patients with ST‐segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) are usually referred for invasive strategy.In broader STEMI cohorts, there is robust evidence that primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is superior to fibrinolysis\n10\n, \n11\n, \n12\n, \n13\n and that timely PCI is the preferred reperfusion strategy in patients with symptom onset within 48 hours.\n14\n But in those historical studies assessing reperfusion strategies, patients ≥80 years were either excluded or underrepresented.\n15\n, \n16\n, \n17\n, \n18\n No randomized controlled trial (RCT) exclusively enrolling patients with STEMI ≥80 years old has been conducted yet. As reperfusion strategies might be less effective or might even cause harm in this patient group with more morbidity,\n19\n conservative treatment could represent a reasonable strategy following the “primum non nocere” principle. In depth, the authors of the current European Society of Cardiology guideline on acute coronary syndrome emphasized that the optimal treatment strategy of older patients with STEMI—who often suffer from frailty or comorbidities—still represents a gap in the evidence.\n14\n Targeted treatment algorithms considering specific needs and demands of older patients are required.A meta‐analysis of the available reports enrolling this understudied patient group is warranted, to further elucidate the efficacy of PCI compared with conservative treatment in older people.METHODSThis meta‐analysis was conducted using a protocol and reproducible plan for literature search and synthesis. The meta‐analysis was prospectively registered (International Prospective Register of Systematic ReviewsCRD42024551601). It was reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analysis guidelines.\n20\n Data are available and can be extracted from studies included. We did not obtain ethical approval for this meta‐analysis because we did not collect data from individual human subjects.The systematic literature search was performed in three data bases including Medline (via PubMed), Web of Science, and Cochrane Library. The search strategy for each database is provided in the Supporting Information Appendix. The first search was performed on May 27, 2024, and the last search update was performed on August 27, 2024. No restrictions on publication date, language, or study size were applied. After exclusion of duplicates and screening of titles and abstracts according to the eligibility criteria, full texts of the remaining articles were assessed. Additional handsearching of screened references was performed. The study selection was independently performed by 2 reviewers (S.M., D.D.). In case of any disagreement, this was resolved by consensus with the senior authors (C.F., T.S.).Controlled trials comparing invasive strategy with intended primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI group) to conservative strategy (CON group) in patients aged ≥80 years with STEMI were considered.RCTs and nonrandomized controlled studies of interventions (NRSIs) were eligible. In NRSI adjusted data were preferred over crude data whenever eligible. Studies treating patients before Food and Drug Administration approval of coronary stents in 1994 were excluded as they underly an inherent risk of performance bias in the PCI group throughout.\n21\n This criterion was added as a post hoc adjustment. No other restrictions were applied for specific interventional or conservative treatment strategies, follow‐up duration, or timing of the intervention itself.Double publications, case reports, case series without control groups, reviews, meta‐analyses and conference abstracts, or posters were excluded. Studies grouping revascularization techniques (eg, PCI and emergent coronary artery bypass grafting) or studies with solely coronary artery bypass grafting revascularization were excluded. Studies including younger patients (<80 years) and without providing separate reports on outcomes of older patients were excluded.Data were independently extracted by 2 investigators (S.M., D.D.) using a standardized prespecified data collection form. Main study reports as well as any Supporting Information Appendices and study protocols were reviewed. Prespecified data elements included study design, patient baseline characteristics, intervention, and follow‐up data. In case of published follow‐up reports or several reports of the same cohorts the longest available observational period was preferred, and event data were extracted accordingly.The primary end point was overall survival calculated from the longest available follow‐up of each individual study. Secondary outcomes included in‐hospital, 30‐day “short‐term,” and 1‐year “long‐term” mortality—each defined as death from any cause. Additionally, cardiac mortality, heart failure hospitalization, repeated hospitalizations, and major bleeding were assessed as defined per individual trial.Per protocol, the present meta‐analysis should assess major adverse cardiac events (defined as a composite of cardiac mortality, MI, and target vessel/lesion revascularization), any bleeding and minor bleeding, but these were not thoroughly reported in the included trials. Consequently, these were eliminated from the present analysis.Risk of bias (RoB) at study level would have been assessed using the Cochrane Collaborations risk‐of‐bias tool (RoB2, version August 22, 2019) for RCTs per protocol,\n22\n but RCTs were not available. NRSIs were assessed using the Cochrane Collaborations Risk of Bias in Non‐randomized Studies of Interventions (version October 20, 2016) tool.\n23\n RoB assessment was independently performed by 2 investigators (S.M., D.D.). In case of discrepancy a third independent investigator was consulted (T.S.). RoB assessment was performed with focus on the primary outcome.Random‐effects meta‐analyses were performed using the DerSimonian‐Laird's method for dichotomous event data. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs are given for each analysis with a 2‐sided significance level of P<0.05 (RevMan 5.3, Nordic Cochrane Centre, Cochrane Collaboration). The extent of heterogeneity was approximated by I2 tests considering 0% to 40% as nonimportant, 30% to 60% as moderate, 50% to 90% as substantial and 75% to 100% as considerable heterogeneity.\n24\n Prespecified funnel plot analysis was performed for the primary outcome. Additionally, quantitative funnel plot analysis by Egger's regression test was added following a post hoc adjustment (R statistics, Metafor package, version 4.4‐0).Sensitivity meta‐analysis of the primary outcome was performed according to RoB judgment. As all included NRSIs were judged to be at critical RoB in the confounding domain, sensitivity analysis would have lost its discriminative power. Therefore, the NRSIs with “serious” or “critical” RoB in any other domain were excluded from the modified sensitivity analysis. Again, this was a post hoc adjustment. An additional post hoc sensitivity meta‐analysis was conducted using a fixed‐effects model.A further post hoc subgroup meta‐analysis of the primary outcome was performed according to the follow‐up duration: as long‐term mortality data were included in secondary outcome analysis, those reports with a follow‐up duration >12 months were considered to further assess long‐term prognosis.We did not obtain ethical approval for this meta‐analysis because we did not collect data from individual human subjects.RESULTSStudy SelectionA total of 1446 articles were identified by the first literature search (see Figure 1). After removing duplicates, the titles and abstracts of 1012 remaining references were screened. Of these, 955 were excluded, which left 57 references to assess full‐text eligibility. Fourteen publications\n5\n, \n6\n, \n25\n, \n26\n, \n27\n, \n28\n, \n29\n, \n30\n, \n31\n, \n32\n, \n33\n, \n34\n, \n35\n, \n36\n reporting on 13 patient cohorts were evaluated. Two publications\n25\n, \n26\n had an overlap of study cohorts; the most recent report\n26\n was considered for further analysis. Ultimately, 13 studies were included in the quantitative analysis. The last search update from August 27, 2024, did not reveal further eligible studies.Figure 1Flow chart diagram.STEMI indicates ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction.CohortsThirteen patient cohorts were considered (see Table 1).\n5\n, \n6\n, \n26\n, \n27\n, \n28\n, \n29\n, \n30\n, \n31\n, \n32\n, \n33\n, \n34\n, \n35\n, \n36\n All of these were either registry analyses or retrospective case series with unadjusted comparisons of PCI to CON.

Of these, 31 629 (31%) were assigned to PCI and 70 529 (69%) were managed conservatively. The first patient was treated in 2003, and the last patient was managed in December 2019. Most patients (98%) were included in registries reporting on nonagenarians.\n5\n, \n6\n The baseline characteristics are summarized in Table 1.The STEMI definitions met the criteria of contemporary classifications and were comparable to the greatest possible extent (see Supporting Information Appendix, Table S1). CON was defined as medical therapy on individual study level. Reported reasons to not perform PCI included but were not limited to refusal of the patient, absence of a culprit lesion, anatomy not suitable for PCI, cardiogenic shock, frailty, cognitive impairment, or significant comorbidities as judged by the treating interventional cardiologist. In 5 trials\n5\n, \n6\n, \n26\n, \n34\n, \n36\n patients in the CON group were referred for coronary angiography but did not receive PCI.In PCI group, the angioplasty rate varied from 82.2% to 100% whenever reported. Of these, 77.8% to 92.3% of patients were treated with stent implantation. Stent implantation data were given for only 318 patients in PCI group (1%) and were not reported for remaining patients. In detail, 146 (45.9%) were treated with bare metal stents and 172 (54.1%) received drug‐eluting stents.Antithrombotic treatment regimens were sparsely reported, so direct comparison between CON and PCI was not feasible (see Supporting Information Appendix, Table S2). The follow‐up period ranged from 30 days to 26.5 months.Risk of Bias AssessmentThe RoB assessment is summarized in Table 2. All trials were judged to be at critical RoB in the “confounding” domain. This judgment based on severe imbalances in PCI and CON groups. For example, patients in CON were more morbid and frailer compared with PCI group. The clinical status mainly contributed to the decision for or against reperfusion, and this selection into treatment groups represents an inherent source of confounding automatically favoring PCI group.Table 2Risk of Bias Assessment of Nonrandomized Controlled Studies of InterventionsConfoundingPatient selectionClassification of interventionDeviations from the intended interventionsMissing dataOutcome measurementSelection of the reported resultsOverall risk of biasCepas‐Guillén et al.CriticalModerateModerateSeriousLowLowModerateCriticalHu et al.CriticalModerateModerateModerateLowLowModerateCriticalIonescu et al.CriticalModerateModerateModerateLowLowModerateCriticalIsmayl et al.CriticalSeriousModerateModerateLowLowModerateCriticalKumar et al.CriticalModerateModerate to seriousModerateLowLowModerateCriticalPajjuru et al.CriticalSeriousModerateModerateLowLowModerateCriticalPiegza et al.CriticalModerateModerateModerateLowLowModerateCriticalRicci et al.CriticalModerateModerateModerateLowLowModerateCriticalRymuza et al.CriticalSeriousModerateSeriousLowLowModerateCriticalSahin et al.CriticalModerateModerateSeriousLowLowModerateCriticalSim et al.CriticalModerateModerateModerateLowLowModerateCriticalVandecasteele et al.CriticalModerateModerate to seriousSeriousLowLowModerateCriticalYudi et al.CriticalModerateModerateSeriousLowModerateModerateCriticalIn detailed view of the other domains, 3 trials were judged to be at serious RoB in the “patient selection” domain.\n5\n, \n6\n, \n32\n Of these, 1 trial excluded patients treated in December,\n5\n 1 trial excluded critically ill patients and those who died on the day of admission,\n6\n and 1 study excluded patients with unsuccessful PCI as well as those with serious comorbidities potentially affecting the outcome.\n32\n\nOne study\n29\n excluded invasively managed patients without a culprit lesion from the PCI group. This indicates moderate‐to‐serious RoB in “classification of intervention” domain.In analysis of the “deviations from intended intervention” domain 5 trials were judged to be at serious RoB.\n26\n, \n32\n, \n33\n, \n35\n, \n36\n Crossover from patients with either failed PCI or without clear culprit lesions to the CON group and evidence of facilitated PCI in an unknown proportion of the CON group in 1 trial were the drivers of this judgment. In 1 other study 40% of CON patients were treated with fibrinolytic therapy as reperfusion strategy,\n32\n and 8 trials did not specify whether patients received pharmacological reperfusion or not.A source of “other bias” was present, as medical postinfarction therapy did differ between the CON and PCI groups in many studies with more guideline adherence in the PCI group. This might have contributed to both short‐ and long‐term outcome.Primary Outcome Analysis: Overall SurvivalAll 13 studies including 102 158 older patients were considered in the primary outcome analysis. Of these, 31 629 received PCI and 70 529 were managed conservatively. The overall survival was 76.5% in PCI and 67.2% in CON at the time of longest available follow‐up (see Figure 2, OR, 2.18 [95% CI, 1.79–2.66], P<0.001, I2=88%, favoring PCI, considerable heterogeneity). Both visual and quantitative funnel plot analysis showed asymmetry indicating publication bias (see Figure S1, Egger's test P value 0.0086).Figure 2Forest plot of overall survival analysis.CON indicates conservative treatment; M‐H, Mantel–Haenszel; and PCI, percutaneous coronary intervention.Sensitivity AnalysisThe first sensitivity analysis was based on the RoB assessment and included all trials with ≤ moderate RoB in all other domains than confounding. Five studies were eligible. The overall survival was 76.2% in PCI and 57.6% in CON group (see Figure S2, OR 2.52 [95% CI, 1.88–3.38], P<0.001, I2=0%, favoring PCI, nonimportant heterogeneity).The second post hoc sensitivity analysis excluded the 2 registries,\n5\n, \n6\n including 98% of patients and contributing to a statistical weight of 37% in the primary outcome analysis. This test was performed to further assess validity of results and to overcome statistical heterogeneity detected in I2 statistics. Ultimately, 2895 patients remained for this exploratory analysis. Of these, 1665 were treated with PCI and 1230 were managed conservatively. Consistently, the overall survival rate was 78.9% in the PCI and 56.9% in the CON group at the time of longest available follow‐up (OR 2.38 [95% CI, 1.96–2.90], P<0.001, I2=3%, favoring PCI, nonimportant heterogeneity). The third sensitivity analysis was based on a fixed effects model and resulted in an OR of 1.67 with a narrower CI: 1.62 to 1.72 (P<0.0001, favoring PCI).Subgroup AnalysisSubgroup analysis of studies with a follow‐up duration exceeding the 1‐year period included 3 reports.\n27\n, \n28\n, \n33\n The mean follow‐up varied from 21.7 to 26.5 months. The overall survival was 69.2% in PCI and 49.3% in CON group (see Figure S3, OR, 2.78 [95% CI, 1.78–4.36], P<0.001, I2=0%, favoring PCI, nonimportant heterogeneity).Secondary Outcome AnalysesIn‐Hospital MortalityOverall, 100 832 patients from 8 studies were analyzed. The event rate was 15% in the PCI and 28.9% in the CON group (see Figure 3A, OR, 0.45 [95% CI, 0.38–0.54], P<0.001, I2=80%, favoring PCI, considerable heterogeneity).Figure 3Secondary mortality analyses. A, In‐hospital mortality.

The event rate was 29.1% in the PCI and 54.4% in the CON group (see Figure 3C, OR, 0.34 [95% CI, 0.25–0.46], P<0.001, I2 = 0%, favoring PCI, nonimportant heterogeneity).Cardiac MortalityA total of 671 patients from 2 studies were analyzed. The event rate was 18.0% in the PCI and 38.8% in the CON group (see Figure 3D, OR, 0.35 [95% CI, 0.23–0.52], P<0.001, I2=0%, favoring PCI, nonimportant heterogeneity).Major BleedingOverall, 893 patients from 6 studies were eligible. The event rate was 5.6% in the PCI and 4.1% in the CON group (see Figure 4, OR, 1.55 [95% CI, 0.77–3.12], P=0.22, I2=0%, nonimportant heterogeneity).Figure 4Forest plot of major bleeding.CON indicates conservative treatment; M‐H, Mantel–Haenszel; and PCI, percutaneous coronary intervention.Heart Failure HospitalizationsA total of 37 694 patients from 3 studies were analyzed. The event rate was 20.7% in the PCI and 18.4% in the CON group (OR, 1.17 [95% CI, 1.11–1.23], P<0.001, I2=0%, favoring CON, nonimportant heterogeneity).Repeated Hospitalizations of Any CauseOverall, 37 387 patients from 3 studies were analyzed. The event rate was 22.1% in the PCI and 16.2% in the CON group (OR 1.31 [95% CI 0.70–2.46], P=0.40, I2=22%, nonimportant heterogeneity).Sensitivity analyses for all secondary outcomes using a fixed effects model are presented in Figure S4.DISCUSSIONThe present meta‐analysis comprehensively assessed efficacy and safety of an invasive triage with intended PCI compared with conservative treatment in older patients with STEMI. The main and novel findings were:\nThe minority of the older patients with STEMI (31%) were triaged to invasive strategy with PCI; these data are dominated by all‐comer registries with reduced quality of evidencePCI was associated with a more favorable overall survival and short‐ and long‐term mortality, but patients referred for PCI were specifically selected as candidates for reperfusion indicating confoundingEvery second patient in CON group survived for 1 year or longer despite the deprivation of PCIThere was no difference in major bleeding between PCI and CON indicating an acceptable risk profileHeart failure hospitalizations and any hospitalizations were more likely in PCI group\nIn patients with STEMI the triage to invasive strategy including PCI represents the standard of care. This contemporary STEMI guideline recommendation is independent of age.\n14\n Accordingly, preexisting observational reports proved technical feasibility of PCI and showed acceptable short‐ and midterm survival in older patients with STEMI.\n37\n, \n38\n, \n39\n In addition, PCI was superior to fibrinolysis in older patients with AMI.\n40\n These findings support that PCI might be preferred over other treatment strategies even in older patients with STEMI. Nonetheless, the present systematic analysis indicates an underuse of PCI in older patients in the published literature. This discrepancy was mostly driven by national registries reporting on nonagenarians.\n5\n, \n6\n Ageism might be hypothesized, but the individual reasons against invasive management remain unclear in study‐level meta‐analysis. Some authors clarified the decision‐making process. The predominant reasons to not triage older patients to invasive strategy were age,\n28\n, \n35\n cognitive impairment,\n26\n, \n28\n, \n35\n, \n36\n known comorbidities,\n28\n, \n29\n, \n32\n, \n35\n cardiogenic shock, or resuscitation.\n29\n, \n32\n, \n35\n Additionally, impaired functional status, frailty, impaired mobility, or admission from residential care were reported.\n26\n, \n34\n, \n36\n This emphasized that the CON group had an inherent risk of worse outcome reflecting clinical variation between the groups. Consequently, the advantageous overall survival following invasive triage to PCI was an expected finding and the positive selection process in this group might have even intensified the observed outcome difference.The survival advantage following PCI was not limited to the first year following STEMI. Instead, this advantage was even present in those trials with a longer follow‐up duration.\n27\n, \n28\n, \n33\n Surprisingly, the long‐term overall survival was remarkably high in the CON group. Even though these patients were judged to be “not suitable” for primary PCI at index STEMI event, they had an acceptable long‐term prognosis. This finding challenges the ad hoc triage to conservative management in this cohort with more morbidity as PCI represents a potentially life‐saving intervention with acceptable procedural risk. The reasonable risk profile is further supported by the finding that there was no difference in major bleeding events in the present analysis. Major bleeding was the only safety end point, and other safety outcomes were not considered. Hence, the selection of those older patients with STEMI with an expected survival advantage following PCI requires further rework.Timely treatment of AMI in older patients is challenging: they might present with unusual symptoms including dyspnea, syncope, or unexplained fall resulting in diagnostic delay.\n41\n Moreover, clinical judgment should consider all dimensions, and ideally high prevalent geriatric syndromes like frailty, cognitive impairment, and comorbidities\n9\n, \n42\n, \n43\n should be thoroughly assessed and weighed in decision making. These steps delay invasive treatment. On the other hand, structured recording of frailty and significant cognitive impairment might prevent this vulnerable cohort from unwanted and potentially harmful invasive management. In such patients, goal‐oriented management might be preferred and shared decision making is required. Again, selection remains a frequent dilemma.The present analysis showed that patients allocated to invasive strategy had a higher risk of subsequent heart failure hospitalization and of hospitalization from any cause. The increased hospitalizations might be attributed to the procedural risk of PCI itself or to pronounced awareness of caregivers for these patients who were recently suitable for interventional revascularization (positive selection). Notably, those selected for noninvasive management in clinical events with precise interventional treatment algorithms like STEMI will not be admitted to hospital for less impactful events like heart failure in the future. Potentially, treatment goals were redefined to avoid inappropriate therapy in these patients (“primum non nocere”) at end of life or with end‐stage disease. As a results, undertreatment might have resulted in underestimation of hospitalizations in the CON group. Additionally, survivorship bias arising from the subgroup with more morbidity with higher mortality might contribute to increase hospitalization rate in the PCI group.Ultimately, timely patient selection for invasive strategy in older people with STEMI remains a challenge in daily routine. Age itself should not per se determine the allocation to a treatment strategy as even older people might be long‐term survivors.\n17\n A prospective randomized controlled trial assessing the optimized treatment strategy of older patients with STEMI is desired. But recruitment could become an insuperable challenge\n8\n, \n40\n and extensive screening efforts could be anticipated from comparable AMI trials in older patients.\n9\n, \n44\n Beyond the well‐established end points the use of patient‐oriented outcomes might add further value because a potential gain or loss in quality of life might contribute to decision making.LimitationsConfounders on individual study level and interstudy heterogeneity were acknowledged. The main concern was the evidence of significant imbalances in both confounding and selection into the study. Patients in the CON group suffered from negative selection as they were not suitable for catheterization or refused invasive strategy. The extracted data were restricted to study‐level reports. As a result, adjusted analysis stratifying for these imbalances was not possible but would have offered further value.Most patients were nonagenarians (98%), both octogenarians and centenarians were underrepresented, and generalizability to these subgroups is limited. This very old population is at risk of underlying survivorship bias which is an unmeasurable confounder in study‐level meta‐analysis.Moreover, the authors were not able to analyze all prespecified outcomes. Major adverse cardiac events, minor bleeding, and overall bleeding were not thoroughly reported in the analyzed studies. Outcome analysis is further affected by variance in outcome definition. Precisely, cardiac mortality, heart failure hospitalizations, and major bleeding were assessed as defined in the individual trials which indicates heterogeneity.In addition, the use of antithrombotics and revascularization therapy differed between the studies. The duration of antiplatelet therapy is a rapidly evolving research field, and stratified, patient‐oriented deescalation strategies were recently proposed.\n14\n, \n45\n The current evidence indicates that shorter duration of antiplatelets might be equally effective and associated with lower bleeding in older patients after PCI.\n46\n But high‐quality studies to direct antithrombotic treatment in older patients with STEMI are pending.The precise angioplasty strategy was extractable for only 1% of the PCI population. This is an inherent source of bias and mainly caused by the retrospective study design of included trials. Nonetheless, PCI using bare metal stents was a prevalent strategy (45.9%) whenever the rate was reported. This might be related to the treatment periods with the first patient treated in 2003 and the last patient treated in 2019. To date, drug‐eluting stents are explicitly preferred over bare metal stents, but again older people were underrepresented in these landmark trials, and further research is warranted.\n47\n, \n48\n\nCONCLUSIONSThe meta‐analysis indicates a potential underuse of PCI in older patients with STEMI in the published literature. PCI was advantageous in short‐ and long‐term survival compared with conservative treatment, but these results were affected by confounding with more unfavorable characteristics in conservatively managed patients.Surprisingly, the half of the older patients with STEMI not referred for invasive management survived for at least 1 year or longer. This observation in combination with the comparable rate of major bleeding both challenge the ad hoc triage to conservative management in this cohort with more morbidity.Ultimately, these findings have hypothesis‐generating implications. But they emphasize the limited predictive value of age in the triage of STEMI and that PCI should not be automatically withheld in older patients. There is still demand for a RCT assessing efficacy of PCI in STEMI in older patients, but recruiting of representative patients might be an insuperable challenge.Sources of FundingNone.DisclosuresSascha Macherey‐Meyer:received travel costs from Bayer Vital AG; received research grants from Elisabeth & Rudolf Hirsch Foundation; participates as subinvestigator in a clinical trial sponsored by AstraZeneca.

IntroductionNonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) is an independent risk factor for \nischemic stroke and leads to a fivefold increase in mortality compared with \nnormal subjects [1]. NVAF is one of the important causes of stroke and \ncardiovascular events worldwide. According to statistics, the risk of stroke in \natrial fibrillation (AF) patients is five times higher than that in the general population, and the \nincidence of NVAF and associated stroke risk are significantly increased, \nespecially in elderly patients. Pathophysiological mechanisms of NVAF involve \natrial electrophysiological changes like structural remodeling, fibrosis, and \nelectrical conduction abnormalities, leading to ineffective atrial contraction \nand arrhythmia. Structural changes in the atrium, inflammatory responses, and \nautonomic nervous system effects also contribute to the development and \nmaintenance of NVAF, with underlying diseases and chronic inflammation playing \nkey roles in promoting the arrhythmia [2].Due to ineffective and irregular rapid atrial contraction and diastolic \ndysfunction, blood circulation through the left atrium or left atrial appendage \ncan lead to stagnation, resulting in the formation of left atrial thrombus (LAT) \nor left atrial appendage thrombus (LAAT) [3]. In the evaluation of biomarkers for \nleft atrial appendage thrombosis, MPV (mean platelet volume), NT-proBNP \n(N-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide), RDW (red blood cell distribution \nwidth) and CHA2DS2-VASc score have shown certain potential. In-depth study of \nthese biomarkers can help reveal their true value in clinical applications and \ninform future therapeutic strategies [4]. LAT or LAAT serves as the source of \nembolus in AF [5]. Therefore, thrombus resolution is \ncrucial in preventing embolic events in AF patients with LAT or LAAT.Anticoagulant drugs in the clinical application for AF can be categorized into \ntwo groups, namely, warfarin and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) and non-vitamin K \nantagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and \napixaban. Before the introduction of NOACs, studies had demonstrated that \nwarfarin reduced the risk of stroke by 66% [6]. However, patients with AF often \nstruggle with compliance and coordination due to the influence of food and drug \ninteractions, the need for the frequent monitoring of coagulation, and a narrow \ntreatment time window associated with warfarin use. Recent studies have confirmed \nthat NOACs are more effective than warfarin in preventing stroke and reducing \nbleeding events in patients with NVAF [7, 8, 9]. Consequently, NOACs are now \nrecommended in the guidelines for the prevention of embolic events in patients \nwith NVAF [10].In AF patients with LAT or LAAT, the primary challenge is dissolving the \nthrombus. Karwowski et al. [11] have confirmed that a significant \nproportion (approximately 58%) of the population is affected by LAT/LAAT. \nAlthough case reports [12, 13] and clinical research [14, 15, 16] have shown that NOACs \nare as effective and safe as VKAs in treating AF patients with LAT/LAAT, there \nare limited data on the efficacy and safety of LAT/LAAT resolution with NOACs. \nThe optimal regimen for thrombolytic therapy in AF patients with LAT/LAAT remains \nunclear. Therefore, this study aimed to systematically evaluate the efficacy and \nsafety of NOACs and VKAs in treating LAT/LAAT through meta-analysis. The results \nof this study could provide valuable insights for the clinical management of AF \npatients with LAT/LAAT.2. Data SourcesWe searched both Chinese (CBM (China Biology Medicine disc), CNKI (China \nNational Knowledge Infrastructure), VIP (Chinese Technology Periodical Database), \nand Wanfang) and English (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science) \ndatabases without imposing any restrictions on the study type. The databases were \nsearched from their inception to June 30, 2022. A manual reference search was \nconducted to meet inclusion criteria and enhance the reliability of the study \nconclusions. A search formula using keywords was structured as follows: (“new \noral anticoagulant” OR “non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants” OR rivaroxaban OR \ndabigatran OR apixaban OR edoxaban) AND (“atrial fibrillation” OR “left \natrium” OR “left atrial appendage” OR thrombus) AND (“resolution” OR \n“dissolution” OR “decomposition” OR “dissolve” OR “thrombolysis”) AND \n(“randomised controlled trial” OR “controlled clinical trial” OR randomised \nOR randomly OR trial). The search strategy used in this study is \noutlined in Table 1. The reporting of the study followed the Preferred \nReporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA).Table 1.\nSearch strategy used in this study.NoSearch terms1new oral anticoagulant .ti,mesh.2non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants .ti,ab.3atrial fibrillation .ti,ab .4or 1–35rivaroxaban.ti,ab.6dabigatran.ti,ab.7apixaban .ti,ab.8edoxaban .ti,ab.9or 5–810resolution11resolution12decomposition13dissolve14or 10–1315left atrium .ti,ab.16left atrial appendage .ti,ab.17or 15–1618thrombus .ti,ab.19thrombolysis .ti,ab.20or 18–1921randomised controlled trial.pt.22controlled clinical trial.pt.23randomised.ab.24randomly.ab.25trial.ab.26or 21–2527exp animals/not humans.sh.2826 not 27294 and 9 and 14 and 17 and 20 and 26 and 282.1 Eligibility CriteriaThe inclusion criteria for this study were patients with NVAF and LAT/LAAT as \ndiagnosed by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) or multirow helical computed tomography \n(MDCT). Left atrial appendage sludge (LAAS) was also included due to high \nthrombosis risk [17]. In terms of interventions, the test group received NOACs \n(rivaroxaban, apixaban, xaban, and dabigatran) without dose limitation and the \ncontrol group received oral VKA. Regarding outcome measures, efficacy indicators \nincluded LAT/LAAT resolution; safety indicators included embolic events, bleeding \nevents, cardiovascular adverse events, and all-cause deaths.The exclusion criteria were as follows: ① studies with patients with \nvalvular AF; ② studies using interfering drugs (e.g., heparin, aspirin, \nand clopidogrel); ③ studies with less than 20 cases (the exclusion of \nstudies with a sample size of fewer than 20 cases in a meta-analysis is a \nmethodological strategy employed to enhance the quality, reliability, and \nvalidity of the pooled findings by minimizing biases, ensuring statistical power, \nimproving generalizability, and enhancing the precision and stability of effect \nestimates.); ④ studies with unknown outcomes, an abstract-only format, \nor no access to the full text or data; ⑤ case reports, reviews, \nconference summaries, animal experiments, meta-analyses, or “other” article \ntypes; or ⑥ duplicate articles or articles from the same institution (in \nsuch cases, we selected the one with the longest follow-up and the largest sample \nsize).2.2 Selection of Studies, Data Extraction, and ManagementTwo researchers conducted the literature search and data extraction \nindependently. Disagreements were resolved through consultation with a third \nresearcher. The following data were extracted: first author, publication year, \nstudy type, gender ratio, age, AF type, follow-up duration, follow-up protocol \n(TEE/MDCT), NOAC dose, sample size, outcome measures (LAT/LAAT resolution, \nembolic events, bleeding events, cardiovascular events, and all-cause death), and \npotential factors affecting thrombus resolution (AF subtype, left atrial diameter \n(LAD), and left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDd)).2.3 Certainty of EvidenceThe included articles comprised observational studies (prospective and \nretrospective cohort studies) and randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The \nquality of cohort studies was assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS), \nwhile RCTs were evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias assessment tool. Two \nresearchers independently conducted the evaluation, with a third researcher \nresolving any disagreements.2.4 Data Synthesis and AnalysisThis study used Revman 5.3 software (Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, United \nKingdom) for comprehensive quantitative analysis. Heterogeneity Test: The study \nutilized Q-value statistic tests and I2 tests to assess heterogeneity among \nstudies. A funnel plot was also employed for a preliminary evaluation of \nheterogeneity. Studies were considered homogeneous and within an acceptable range \nif p \n> 0.10 or I2\n≤50%, whereas further investigation was \nwarranted for p \n< 0.10 or I2\n≥50%, potentially requiring \nerror checks, subgroup analysis, and sensitivity analysis, particularly for \nsubstantial heterogeneity (I2\n≥75%). Effect Model: Depending on \nheterogeneity levels, either the Fixed effect model or Random effect model was \nutilized for effect size pooling using the Mantel-Haenszel (M-H) method. Small \nheterogeneity led to the Fixed effect model application, while large \nheterogeneity required the Random effect model, with division into two groups to \naddress clinical heterogeneity and ensure accurate effect size estimation. Effect \nmeasures: Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were employed for \nbinary variables, with interpretation based on the position in the forest plot. \nMean difference (MD) and 95% CI were used for continuous variables, with \nstatistical significance (p \n< 0.05) indicating a significant \ndifference. The OR and MD values guided the impact assessment of intervention \nmeasures on observed outcomes. Sensitivity Analysis: Various techniques, such as \nmodifying conditions, clipping and filling, and individually excluding studies, \nwere employed to gauge model reliability and assess sources of heterogeneity. \nOne-at-a-time exclusion of individual studies followed by repeat meta-analysis \ndetermined the influence on overall effect size, highlighting key studies \nimpacting outcomes significantly. Bias Evaluation: The study used a funnel plot \nto discern publication bias, with an ideal pattern reflecting a symmetrical \ndistribution of large and small sample studies. Detection of missing negative \nresults in the plot indicated potential publication bias.3. Results3.1 Characteristics of the Included StudiesThe systematic search of databases retrieved 1065 articles. After removing \nduplicates, 847 articles remained. Following the exclusion of medical records, \nreviews, conference abstracts, animal experiments, meta-analyses, guidelines, and \nunrelated articles, 44 articles remained. Full-text evaluation resulted in the \nexclusion of articles with no VKA control; articles with repeated data, valvular \nAF, incomplete data, mismatched outcome indicators, and inadequate sample size; \nand articles without access to full text, leaving 12 articles for inclusion. The \nliterature screening process is illustrated in Fig. 1.Fig. 1.\nFlowchart of literature screening. Note: CNKI, China National \nKnowledge Infrastructure; VIP, Chinese Technology Periodical Database; CBM, China \nBiology Medicine disc; WOS, Web of Science; LAT, left atrial thrombus.The 12 included articles comprised eight cohort studies (four prospective \n[18, 19, 20, 21] and four retrospective [22, 23, 24, 25]) and four RCTs [26, 27, 28, 29]. Our study included \n982 NVAF patients with LAT/LAAT, with 490 in the experimental group receiving \nNOACs and 492 in the control group receiving VKAs.

In sensitivity analysis, the meta-analysis is conducted \nwith and without the high-risk studies to assess the robustness of the findings. \nInterpretation of results should consider the potential influence of studies with \na high risk of bias on the pooled effect estimates. If sensitivity analysis \nindicates a significant impact on results or the conclusions drawn, alternative \nstrategies, such as subgroup analysis or additional assessments of study quality, \nmay be necessary.Table 3 shows the NOS scores of the included cohort studies. Namely, two studies \nscored 8 stars [19, 22], four studies scored 7 stars [20, 21, 23, 24], one study \nscored 6 stars [18], and one study scored 5 stars [30]. The Cochrane Risk of Bias \nassessment tool was used for the included RCTs, as depicted in Fig. 2. Allocation \nand selection bias had uncertain risk due to the lack of information in most \narticles. Blinding was not described, resulting in uncertain risk. Follow-up and \nreporting bias had low risk. None of the articles exhibited selective reporting \nbias. \nTable 3.\nNewcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS) scores of the included cohort studies.Bring into studyPublish a particular yearSelectionComparabilityOutcomeTotal pointsYan et al.

Among 492 patients treated with NOACs and 490 patients treated \nwith VKAs, there was no heterogeneity (p = 0.55, I2 = 0%), \nallowing for a fixed-effects model analysis. The results indicated a higher \nthrombolysis rate with NOACs than with VKAs (78.0% vs. 63.5%), with a \nstatistically significant difference (OR = 2.32, 95% CI 1.71 to 3.15, p\n< 0.0001) (Fig. 3).Fig. 3.\nComparison of the thrombolysis efficacy \nbetween novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). CI, \nconfidence interval; M-H, Mantel-Haenszel.3.3.1.2 Rivaroxaban vs. VKAsNine studies (totaling 602 patients) comparing thrombolysis rates of rivaroxaban \nand VKAs were included [18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 26, 27, 28, 29]. Among 269 patients receiving \nrivaroxaban and 333 patients receiving VKAs, there was no significant \nheterogeneity (p = 0.89, I2 = 0%). Therefore, a fixed-effects \nmodel was used for meta-analysis. The results showed a higher thrombolysis rate \nwith rivaroxaban than with VKAs (82.5% vs. 67.3%), with a statistically \nsignificant difference (OR = 2.22, 95% CI 1.47 to 3.35, p = 0.0001) (Fig. 4).Fig. 4.\nComparison of thrombolytic efficacy between \nrivaroxaban and vitamin K antagonist.

Among 119 patients receiving \ndabigatran and 136 patients receiving VKAs, there was no significant \nheterogeneity (p = 0.64, I2 = 0%). Therefore, a fixed-effects \nmodel was used for meta-analysis. The results showed no significant difference in \nthrombolysis rates between dabigatran and VKAs (69.7% vs. 64.7%; OR = 1.36, \n95% CI 0.78 to 2.35, p = 0.28) (Fig. 5).Fig. 5.\nComparison of thrombolysis efficacy between dabigatran and \nvitamin K antagonist.

Among 22 patients receiving apixaban and \n76 patients receiving VKAs, there was no significant heterogeneity (p = \n0.62, I2 = 0%). Therefore, a fixed-effects model was used for \nmeta-analysis. The results showed no significant difference in thrombolysis rates \nbetween apixaban and VKAs (59.1% vs. 55.3%; OR = 1.44, 95% CI 0.54 to 3.85, \np = 0.47) (Fig. 6).Fig. 6.\nComparison of thrombolysis efficacy between apixaban and vitamin \nK antagonist.

Among 87 patients receiving \nrivaroxaban and 100 patients receiving dabigatran, there was no significant \nheterogeneity (p = 0.83, I2 = 0%). Thus, a fixed-effects model was \nused for meta-analysis. The results showed no significant difference in \nthrombolysis rates between rivaroxaban and dabigatran (73.6% vs. 55.3%; OR = \n1.12, 95% CI 0.56 to 2.20, p = 0.75) (Fig. 7).Fig. 7.\nComparison of thrombolysis efficacy between rivaroxaban and \ndabigatran. CI, confidence interval; M-H, Mantel-Haenszel.3.3.2 Efficacy of Thrombolysis with NOACs and VKAs at Different \nFollow-Up TimesSubgroup analysis was conducted to compare the effect of follow-up time on \nthrombolysis rates between NOACs and VKAs. (1) In the studies with a 3-month \nfollow-up (six articles [18, 19, 25, 26, 28, 29], 438 patients), NOACs had a \nhigher thrombolysis rate than VKAs (79.3% vs. 56.2%; OR = 2.82, 95% CI \n1.83 to 4.36, p \n< 0.00001). (2) In the studies with >3 months of \nfollow-up (six articles [20, 21, 23, 26, 27, 28], 496 patients), NOACs also had a \nhigher thrombolysis rate than VKAs (77.0% vs. 70.0%; OR = 2.09, 95% CI \n1.36 to 3.21, p = 0.0008). Follow-up time did not affect the thrombolysis \nrate, with NOACs consistently demonstrating superior thrombolytic effects (Fig. 8). \nFig. 8.\nComparison of thrombolysis efficacy between NOACs and VKAs at \ndifferent follow-up times.

(1) In the RCTs (four articles [26, 27, 28, 29], 382 patients), NOACs \nshowed higher thrombosis resolution rates than VKAs (86.8% vs. 72.0%; OR = \n2.58, 95% CI 1.52 to 4.38, p = 0.0005). (2) In the cohort studies (eight \narticles [18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25], 600 patients), NOACs demonstrated higher thrombolysis rates \nthan VKAs (72.9% vs. 57.6%; OR = 2.20, 95% CI 1.52 to 3.19, p \n< \n0.0001). The subgroup analysis confirmed the consistent superiority of NOACs in \nthrombolysis across different types of studies (Fig. 9).Fig. 9.\nEfficacy of thrombolysis between NOACs and VKAs in different \ntypes of studies.

Two studies [18, 29] reported no new embolic events in both \ngroups during the follow-up. A total of 466 patients were included, with 232 in \nthe NOAC group and 234 in the VKA group. The heterogeneity test showed no \nsignificant heterogeneity (p = 0.96, I2 = 0%); thus, a \nfixed-effect model was used. The results demonstrated no significant differences \nin the incidence of stroke or embolic events between NOACs and VKAs (3.4% vs. \n7.7%; OR = 0.44, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.02, p = 0.83) (Fig. 10).Fig. 10.\nComparison of the rate of embolic events between NOACs and \nVKAs.

In the study involving 546 patients, with 272 in the NOAC group \nand 274 in the VKA group, there were 22 and 27 bleeding events, respectively. \nThere was no significant heterogeneity (p = 0.88, I2 = 0%), and a \nfixed-effects model was used. The results indicated no significant difference in \nbleeding event incidence between NOACs and VKAs (8.1% vs. 9.9%; OR = 0.91, 95% \nCI 0.49 to 1.71, p = 0.77) (Fig. 11).Fig. 11.\nComparison of the rate of \nbleeding events between NOACs and VKAs.

In the study, 123 patients were included, with 71 in the NOAC group \nand 52 in the VKA group; there were seven and five mortality outcomes, \nrespectively. No significant heterogeneity was found (p = 0.44, I2 \n= 0%), and a fixed-effects model was used. The results showed no significant \ndifference in death rates between NOACs and VKAs (9.9% vs. 9.6%; OR = 0.96, \n95% CI 0.29 to 3.19, p = 0.94) (Fig. 12).Fig. 12.\nDeath event incidence in comparison of NOACs and VKAs.

Significant heterogeneity was \nobserved in the LVEF group, but further subgroup analysis was not possible due to \nlimited relevant literature. Therefore, a random-effects model was used. The \nfollowing results were obtained: (1) LVEDd: The ineffective group had a \nsignificantly reduced LVEDd compared with the effective group (MD = 1.11, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.49, p \n< 0.00001). (2) LVEF: There was no \nsignificant difference in LVEF between the effective and ineffective groups (MD = \n1.25, 95% CI –5.56 to 8.05, p = 0.72). (3) LAD: The effective group \nshowed a significantly smaller LAD than the ineffective group (MD = –2.30, 95% \nCI –4.49 to –0.11, p = 0.04) (Fig. 13).Fig. 13.\nLeft ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDd), left \nventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and left atrial diameter (LAD) between the \neffective and ineffective group.

In the study, there were a \ntotal of 218 patients. Of 86 patients in the paroxysmal AF group, thrombolysis \nwas achieved in 56, whereas of 132 patients in the persistent AF group, \nthrombolysis was achieved in 83. Significant heterogeneity was acceptable (p = 0.19, I2 = 39%), and a fixed-effect model was used. The \nmeta-analysis showed no significant difference in thrombolysis rate between \nparoxysmal and persistent AF patients (65.1% vs. 62.9%; OR = 1.57, 95% CI \n0.84 to 2.94, p = 0.16) (Fig. 14).Fig. 14.\nComparison of thrombolysis rates for different subtypes of \nAF.

Individual studies had minimal impact on \nthe overall effect size, and the results of each study comparison were stable.3.3.8 Assessment of Publication BiasThe funnel plot results (Fig. 15) demonstrated that the included studies in each \noutcome were within the 95% CI of the funnel plot. The study points were also \ndistributed symmetrically, indicating no significant publication bias.Fig. 15.\nFunnel plot of thrombolytic efficacy between NOACs and VKAs. \nVKAs, vitamin K antagonists; NOACs, novel oral anticoagulants; OR, odds ratio.4. DiscussionWe performed this meta-analysis of four RCTs and eight cohort studies with 982 \npatients to investigate the efficacy of NOACs vs. VKAs in the resolution of AF \nwith LAT/LAAT. The results showed that the thrombolysis rate of NOACs was higher \nthan that of VKAs; NOACs did not increase the risk of stroke or bleeding during \nthe application and had more obvious advantages for thrombosis treatment of NVAF.The incidence of LAAT in AF patients ranges from 0.5% to 14% [31, 32]. \nAntithrombotic therapy is crucial in patients with LAT, as it is an absolute \ncontraindication to radiofrequency ablation. There are limited studies on \nthrombolytic treatment for NVAF with LAT/LAAT, and there have been no large RCTs \nto guide treatment. This study directly compared the efficacy and safety of NOACs \nand VKAs for thrombolytic therapy in NVAF with LAT/LAAT. Warfarin, a \nrepresentative VKA, effectively reduces stroke risk but has limitations in \nclinical use, such as food and drug interactions, frequent monitoring of international normalized ratio (INR), and \nindividual dose–response variability [8]. Current studies suggest maintaining an \nINR between 2.0 and 3.0 for effective anticoagulation without increasing bleeding \nrisk [33, 34]. Most studies in the literature have used an INR range of 2.0–3.0 \nfor the warfarin control group. However, the RCT by Huang Fangfang et \nal. [26] divided warfarin into low-intensity (INR 1.5–2.0) and \nstandard-intensity (INR 2.0–3.0) groups, and they found that the effects in the \nlow-intensity group were not superior, but there was a reduced risk of bleeding.Dabigatran, a direct thrombin inhibitor, has demonstrated a lower prevalence of \nleft heart thrombosis than warfarin in combination therapy [35]. Two common \nclinical doses of dabigatran (110 mg bis in die (BID) and 150 mg BID) have different efficacy \nand safety profiles. The 110 mg BID dose is comparable to warfarin in terms of \nefficacy and reduces bleeding risk, while the 150 mg BID dose increases stroke \nprevention ability but has comparable bleeding risk to warfarin. Study of Lip et al. \n[36] focused on the thrombolysis effect of dabigatran and included studies \nusing both doses. However, there is limited literature on dose grouping, \npreventing further verification of different doses’ effects on efficacy and \nsafety. Dabigatran has shown advantages over VKAs in stroke prevention and \nreducing bleeding risk [8]. Ongoing clinical trials, such as RE-LATED AF-AFNET \n[35], are studying thrombolysis efficacy of dabigatran compared with warfarin, \nwith results awaited. For patients over 80 years old, the recommended dose is 110 \nmg twice daily. This article focuses on dabigatran’s thrombolytic effects; \nhowever, due to insufficient literature on dosing variations, the impact of \ndifferent doses on efficacy and safety remains unverified.Rivaroxaban is a factor Xa inhibitor that effectively inhibits thrombin \nformation. Compared with warfarin, rivaroxaban has high bioavailability and is \nnot affected by food and drug interactions. The ROCKET-AF [37] study has \nextensively evaluated the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban in preventing stroke \nevents. Previous studies, including the X-TRA study [38], have demonstrated the \nthrombolytic effect of rivaroxaban, making it a viable option for NVAF with LAT. \nThe mechanism of rivaroxaban’s thrombolytic effect involves inhibiting thrombin \nrelease from blood clots and increasing fibrinolytic activity [29]. This study \nincludes abundant data on rivaroxaban for LAT in NVAF patients. Subgroup analysis \nconfirmed that rivaroxaban performs better than VKAs in resolving thrombosis in \nAF patients. Current expert consensus recommends a daily dose of 20 mg taken with \nfood; no adjustment is needed for those over 65 years old. However, for elderly \npatients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and Ccr (creatinine clearance rate) \nof 15–30 mL/min, a lower dose of 10 mg/d is advised.Apixaban is a direct oral factor Xa inhibitor, similar to rivaroxaban, that \nregulates thrombin synthesis in anticoagulation for AF. It is superior to \nwarfarin in preventing stroke, reducing bleeding events, and decreasing mortality \nin AF patients [39]. Apixaban is primarily metabolized by the liver and excreted \nthrough the digestive tract and kidneys, requiring caution in patients with liver \ninjury. The standard dose is 5 mg twice daily, but for patients with renal \ninsufficiency, a reduced dose of 2.5 mg twice daily is recommended based on the \nAVERROES and ARISTOTLE [40] trials, especially in elderly patients, those with \nlow body weight, and those with high creatinine levels. These studies have shown \nsimilar efficacy and safety of apixaban compared to warfarin and aspirin in \npatients with normal renal function and even renal failure [41, 42, 43, 44]. However, \nlimited data are available on the thrombolytic effect of apixaban and its \ncomparison to VKAs, with small sample sizes and no statistically significant \ndifferences observed. Understanding the thrombolytic mechanism of apixaban \nhighlights its advantage in shifting the coagulation/fibrinolytic balance toward \nfibrinolytic activity.Edoxaban is a newly approved direct factor Xa inhibitor, similar to rivaroxaban \nand apixaban. One of the distinguishing features of edoxaban is that it does not \ninteract with the cytochrome P-450 system. This makes edoxaban a viable option \nfor patients with AF who require oral anticoagulation and have interactions with \nthe cytochrome P-450 system. Regarding edoxaban dosing, Weitz et al. \n[45] conducted a phase II trial comparing various doses against warfarin; results \nshowed that edoxaban at doses of 30/60 mg/d had similar efficacy and safety \nprofiles. However, data regarding its efficacy in thrombolysis are limited. Only \none study [21] directly compared edoxaban to warfarin in thrombolysis, but it did \nnot provide further comparative data on the thrombolytic effect. More research is \nneeded to investigate the comparative efficacy and safety of edoxaban and VKAs in \nthrombolysis. \nNOACs have demonstrated significant advantages in treating left atrial thrombi, \nwith differences in efficacy influenced by factors such as pharmacokinetics and \ndrug targets. A meta-analysis study indicates that NOACs like rivaroxaban and dabigatran show \npromise in managing non-organized cardiac thrombi early on, potentially as \nstandalone treatments without the need for additional anticoagulants [46]. \nCompared to VKAs, NOACs offer more predictable pharmacokinetics and \npharmacodynamics, ensuring better stability in anticoagulation effects and \nreducing thrombosis or bleeding risks [47]. Moreover, NOACs exhibit limited drug \ninteractions, providing convenience for patients without the risk of reduced \nefficacy or increased side effects due to interactions. With fixed dosages and \nreduced need for frequent laboratory monitoring, NOACs positively impact patient \ncompliance and treatment outcomes [48]. The rapid absorption post-oral \nadministration allows for quick onset of action, especially beneficial in acute \nsituations for timely management of atrial thrombi [28]. The diverse efficacy \namong different NOACs can be explained by their pharmacokinetic variations, \nincluding differences in absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination, \nwhich directly influence their efficacy in anticoagulation. For instance, \nRivaroxaban’s high bioavailability and moderate half-life enable effective \ncoagulation control within a day [45]. NOACs acting on different coagulation \nfactors, such as direct thrombin inhibitors (like Dabigatran) and direct Factor \nXa inhibitors (like Rivaroxaban), have distinct mechanisms impacting their \nclinical outcomes [49]. Individual physiological differences like age, weight, \nand liver or kidney function can also influence NOAC efficacy, potentially \nleading to varied treatment responses among patients [50]. Furthermore, \nvariations in recommended dosages and administration methods among NOACs can \naffect their clinical efficacy and safety.This meta-analysis divided the included studies into subgroups based on the \nfollow-up time and study type. The results showed that NOACs consistently \ndemonstrated better thrombolysis effects than VKAs in different follow-up times \nand study types. Dabigatran and apixaban had higher absolute thrombus resolution \nrates, although significant differences were not observed, likely due to the \nsmall sample sizes. Comparisons between dabigatran and rivaroxaban showed similar \nthrombolytic rates [51]. However, larger clinical trials are needed for further \nconfirmation. During the treatment process, some patients underwent a switch in \nthrombolytic regimens; this led to successful thrombus resolution. Increasing the \ndose of the original drug or switching to another NOAC regimen (such as between \nrivaroxaban and dabigatran) showed good thrombolytic effects [20, 23, 52]. \nHowever, careful monitoring for bleeding risk is crucial when increasing the dose \nof the original thrombolytic agent.Patients with increased left ventricular end-diastolic inner diameter are at \nhigher risk of developing left ventricular thrombosis due to abnormal ventricular \nwall movement and the presence of blood vortex flow in the ventricle. A previous \ncohort study has shown a low risk of LAT [30]. Factors such as an increase in LAD and \ndecreased LVEF, along with persistent AF, are associated with a higher risk of \nthrombus formation in AF patients and can also affect thrombus resolution \n[18, 53]. However, current research on predicting LAT factors is limited. This \nmeta-analysis compared the data from three studies [18, 20, 21] on thrombolysis effectiveness \nand ineffectiveness. The results indicated that patients with ineffective \nthrombolysis had a decrease in LVEDd and an increase in LAD, with statistically \nsignificant differences compared with those with effective thrombolysis. However, \nthe analysis did not reflect the differences in AF subtype and LVEF between the \neffective and ineffective groups due to the limited number of included studies, \nsmall sample sizes, and potential bias. These findings suggest the need for \nfurther investigation into the impact of persistent AF, LVEDd, LAD, and LVEF on \nLAT. Improving these factors may potentially enhance thrombus resolution in \npatients with NVAF and LAT.In this comprehensive meta-analysis evaluating the efficacy and safety of NOACs \nand VKA in thrombolysis for Atrial Fibrillation with LAT/LAAT, minimal \nheterogeneity and high homogeneity were observed. The heterogeneity of each \noutcome index remained stable, unaffected by subgroup analyses or iteratively \nexcluding literature. Despite variations in subject demographics and \ncomorbidities across studies, excluding individual studies showed no significant \nimpact on the consistent and dependable results obtained. However, notable \nheterogeneity was identified in the comparison of LVEF index between effective \nand ineffective thrombolysis groups, with limited data available for subgroup \nanalysis, posing challenges in assessing heterogeneity. In the Nelles et \nal. [21] study, the absence of Left Atrial Appendage closure and alterations in \nanticoagulant therapy due to unresolved atrial thrombus underscore the need for \ncautious interpretation of combined index analysis results.All of the included studies in this analysis used the CHA2DS2-VASc scoring \nsystem to assess the stroke risk in patients with AF. The results indicated that \nthe incidence of embolic events was 3.4% with NOACs compared with 7.7% with \nVKAs, although this difference was not statistically significant (p = \n0.06). Similarly, the incidence of bleeding events during thrombolysis was 8.1% \nwith NOACs and 9.9% with VKAs, and no statistically significant difference was \nobserved (p = 0.77). Only two studies [21, 22] reported on mortality events, and \nthe analysis showed no significant difference in mortality risk between NVAF \npatients with LAT and those treated with VKAs.Limitations of this StudyNumerous limitations in this study warrant acknowledgment. Firstly, the \npredominant inclusion of cohort studies over RCTs poses a limitation, given the \ninherent difficulties in achieving double-blinding and randomization with \nantithrombotic drugs. Secondly, while the efficacy indicators were thorough, the \nabsence of safety indicators and other influencing factors on thrombus resolution \nin the literature may have introduced bias, potentially diminishing result \ncredibility. As a solution, future research should prioritize large-scale \nmulticenter RCTs to mitigate these challenges and strengthen the evidence base. \nAdditionally, exploring concrete research avenues such as comparative dose \nstudies for different NOACs could enhance the understanding of their efficacy in \nresolving atrial fibrillation with left atrial/left atrial appendage thrombus and \nprovide further insights into optimal treatment strategies.5. ConclusionsNOACs have a higher thrombolysis rate in patients with NVAF than VKAs. The use \nof NOACs does not significantly increase the risk of adverse events such as \nembolism, bleeding, and death compared with VKAs.Availability of Data and MaterialsData availability is not applicable to this article as no new data were created \nor analyzed in this study."}

Eligible studies underwent rigorous screening and data extraction to evaluate safety and efficacy outcomes.Results:Four studies met the criteria. The first study reported similar embolic event rates between DOACs (3.9%) and VKAs (2.9%) per 100 patient years, while major bleeding rates were 5.21% and 3.74%, respectively. The second paper found stroke rates of 2% for DOACs and 4% for VKAs, with bleeding complications observed in 10% of DOAC patients compared to 20% in VKA patients. The third cohort demonstrated that DOACs were associated with significantly lower risks of stroke and major bleeding compared to VKAs. The last study reported embolic event rates of 1.6 and 2.0 per 100 patient years for DOACs and VKAs, respectively. In the pooled analysis, DOACs were associated with a reduced risk of thromboembolic events (odds ratio [OR] = 0.52; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.32–0.84), and no difference in major bleeding between the two groups (OR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.25–1.51).Conclusions:Existing studies support the use of DOACs as a non-inferior therapeutic option compared to VKAs for preventing thromboembolism in patients with AF and cardiac amyloidosis. DOACs may also offer practical advantages, including reduced bleeding risks and ease of management, but further high-quality randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings and guide clinical practice.", "body": "1. IntroductionAmyloidosis is a rare group of disorders characterized by the pathological \ndeposition of amyloid fibrils, resulting in from misfolded proteins, within the \nintracellular and/or extracellular compartments of a variety of tissues and \norgans including the heart, kidneys, central nervous system, and digestive system \n[1]. Recent advances in non-invasive diagnostic modalities, such as cardiac \nmagnetic resonance imaging and bone scintigraphy, have revolutionized the \ndetection of cardiac amyloidosis, particularly transthyretin amyloid \ncardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) [2]. These technologies have significantly increased \ndiagnostic accuracy and recognition rates of this previously underdiagnosed \ncondition [3]. Cardiac amyloidosis (CA) encompasses several types, with ATTR-CM and amyloid light-chain (AL) being the most common. ATTR-CM can be further classified into two \nsubtypes, namely wild-type (ATTRwt) and hereditary ATTR (hATTR) amyloidosis [4].CA primarily manifests as restrictive cardiomyopathy [5], characterized by signs \nand symptoms of right ventricular diastolic dysfunction, such as elevated jugular \nvenous pressure, ascites, peripheral edema, and dyspnea. In CA patients, amyloid \ninfiltration of the atrial myocardium leads to complex structural and electrical \nremodeling of the atria, increasing the risk of atrial fibrillation (AF) and \npredisposing patients to thromboembolism due to altered electrophysiological \ncharacteristics [6]. A previous study has reported a high prevalence of AF in CA \npatients, with rates of up to 40% in wtATTR and 11% in hATTR [7]. Therefore, \npreventing the formation of left atrial thrombus is crucial in CA patients with \nAF to reduce the risk of cardioembolic stroke.Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), such as rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran, \nand edoxaban, are newer anticoagulants that have gained recognition as viable \nalternatives to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) such as warfarin. Recent guidelines \nfrom the American Heart Association [8] and the European Society of Cardiology \n[9] have shifted the preference towards DOACs. Currently, anticoagulation therapy \nis recommended for AF patients with CA, regardless of their CHA₂DS₂-VASc \n(Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age ≥75 years, Diabetes mellitus, \nStroke or transient ischemic attack history, Vascular disease, Age 65–74 years, \nand Sex category) score [10]. However, managing anticoagulation in this \npopulation is challenging due to high bleeding risks and frequent renal \nimpairment, complicating clinical decision-making.There is a lack of comprehensive studies that directly compare the \neffectiveness and safety of DOACs with VKAs in AF patients with CA. To address \nthis gap, our current systematic review aimed to comprehensively analyze the \nexisting research on the use of DOACs compared with VKAs in patients with AF and \nCA.2. MethodsOur systematic review followed the guidelines outlined in the Preferred \nReporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA).2.1 Eligibility CriteriaThe following eligibility criteria were applied. Studies were included if they: \n(1) focused on patients with both AF and CA, (2) compared DOACs with VKAs for \nsafety and efficacy, and (3) were published in English. Studies were excluded if \nthey: (1) involved other forms of anticoagulation therapy not relevant to DOACs \nor VKAs, (2) were case reports or reviews rather than observational studies or \nrandomized controlled trials, or (3) did not report on relevant outcomes such as \nthromboembolic or bleeding events.2.2 Literature SearchA systematic independent literature search was performed by 2 reviewers in the \nEMBASE and PubMed databases until January 2024 to identify relevant articles that \nexamined and analyzed the effectiveness and safety of DOACs as compared to VKAs \nin patients with AF and CA. The search employed a combination of the following \nkeywords: (1) “amyloidosis” OR “ATTR-CM” OR “transthyretin amyloid \ncardiomyopathy” OR “ATTR CA” or “light chain amyloid cardiomyopathy”, and \n(2) “anticoagulants” OR “anticoagulation”. We applied the English language \nrestriction in the literature search.2.3 Study SelectionThe initial search was conducted on PubMed and EMBASE databases. Retrieved \nstudies were screened based on their titles and abstracts, and relevant studies \nwere subjected to full-text reading. Studies that fulfilled the eligibility \ncriteria mentioned above were included. Disagreements between the authors were \nresolved by discussion, or by seeking input from a more senior expert.2.4 Data ExtractionThe data extracted from the included studies consisted of the author’s name, \nyear of publication, and baseline characteristics such as age, sex renal \nfunction, CHA2DS2-VASc score, HAS-BLED score (Hypertension, Abnormal \nrenal/liver function, Stroke, Bleeding history, Labile international normalized ratio, Elderly age, \nDrugs/alcohol use), prior disease, study treatment, CA subtypes, study design, \neffectiveness, and safety outcome results.2.5 Statistical AnalysisThe quality of each observational study was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa \nScale (NOS) tool [11]. To evaluate heterogeneity, we conducted a Cochrane Q test \nand calculated the I2 statistic, with results expressed as p-values \nand I2 values. Initially, we conducted a narrative review. For the \nquantitative analysis, we used a Mantel-Haenszel random-effects model to account \nfor potential heterogeneity across the included studies, with analyses performed \nusing Review Manager software (version 5.4, The Cochrane Collaboration, Nordic \nCochrane Center, Copenhagen, Denmark). Effect measures were reported as odds \nratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Subgroup and sensitivity \nanalyses were not conducted due to the limited number of studies included. In \nline with the Cochrane Handbook guidelines [12], publication bias was not \nassessed using a funnel plot, as fewer than 10 studies were included in this \nreview.2.6 Protocol RegistrationThis meta-analysis was not registered in a public database. The authors \nacknowledge the importance of protocol registration for transparency and \nreproducibility.3. Results3.1 Study SelectionThe search and selection process is visually summarized in Fig. 1. Initially, a \ntotal of 790 articles were identified for screening, with 246 articles from the \nPubMed database and 544 articles from the EMBASE database. Following a title and \nabstract screening, 19 studies were selected for full-text review. Of these, 15 \narticles were excluded, leaving a total of 4 studies [13, 14, 15, 16] which met the \ncriteria for our analysis. Detailed information on the study design and baseline \ncharacteristics of the included studies is provided in Table 1 (Ref.

[13]) included \npopulations with only amyloid transthyretin (ATTR), whereas the study by Cariou et al. [15] \nincluded a mixed population of AL, hATTR, and ATTRwt. The study by Mentias \net al. [16] did not stratify participants by amyloidosis subtype.3.2 Narrative Analysis: DOACs versus VKAs in Patients with CAIn the study by Mitrani et al. [14], a cohort of 290 patients diagnosed \nwith ATTR CA between December 2001 and February 2019 were evaluated. Of these, \n217 patients presented with either AF at baseline or were subsequently diagnosed \nwith AF. Treatment included DOACs in 116 patients and warfarin in 78. Embolic \nevents occurred at a rate of 3.9 per 100 patient-years in the DOAC group compared \nto 2.9 per 100 patient-years in the warfarin group (p = 0.74). Major \nbleeding events were observed in 21 patients, with event rates of 5.21 per 100 \npatient-years in the DOAC group and 3.74 per 100 patient-years in the warfarin \ngroup (p = 0.45).In a French single-center trial carried out by Cariou et al. [15], 273 \nCA patients with atrial arrhythmia were enrolled between January 2012 and July \n2020. Patients received anticoagulation with either VKAs (n = 147) or DOACs (n = \n126). The VKA group exhibited poorer renal and cardiac function and included a \nhigher proportion of patients in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV. \nPatients treated with DOAC were predominantly diagnosed with ATTRwt, whereas AL \npatients were more likely to be treated with VKAs. No significant difference was \nfound in stroke rates between DOACs (2%) and VKAs (4%). However, bleeding \ncomplications were more common in the VKA group (20%) than in the DOAC group \n(10%). The VKA group also showed a higher rate of all-cause mortality, but after \nadjusting for age, NYHA class, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels, and renal function, the \nmultivariate analysis found no significant association between anticoagulant type \nand mortality.The retrospective study by Mentias et al. [16] included 551 patients \nwith heart failure and amyloidosis who were newly diagnosed with AF between \nJanuary 2015 and November 2019 and subsequently started on anticoagulation \ntherapy. Of these, 213 received warfarin and 338 received DOACs (with apixaban \naccounting for 70.4% of DOAC prescriptions). Baseline characteristics were \nsimilar between the two groups. Over a median follow-up of 444 days, DOAC-treated \npatients had lower risks of all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = \n0.71, 95% CI: 0.59–0.85), stroke (adjusted HR = 0.44, 95% CI: 0.28–0.70), and \nmajor bleeding (HR = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.36–0.84) compared to those in the warfarin \ngroup.In an international multi-center study by Vilches et al. [13], data \nfrom 1191 patients with ATTR-CM were analyzed across four amyloidosis referral \ncenters in Europe and the United States. Of these, 531 patients with AF received \nanticoagulation therapy with either VKAs (n = 322) or DOACs (n = 239). The \nincidence rates of embolic events were 2.0 per 100 patient-years (95% CI: \n1.2–3.4) in the VKA group and 1.6 per 100 patient-years (95% CI: 0.7–3.9) in the \nDOAC group (p = 0.66). There was no significant difference in the risk \nof major bleeding between the groups (HR = 1.92, 95% CI: 0.94–3.94).3.3 Quantitative Analysis: DOACs versus VKAs in Patients with CAIn the pooled analysis, results from the random-effects model \ndemonstrated that DOACs were associated with a significantly reduced risk of \nthromboembolic events compared to VKAs (odds ratio [OR] = 0.52, 95% CI: \n0.32–0.84). There was no significant difference between DOACs and VKAs in the \nrisk of major bleeding (OR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.25–1.51) or all-cause death (OR = \n0.32, 95% CI: 0.08–1.40) between the two groups (Fig. 2).Fig. 2.\nThromboembolic, bleeding, and all-cause death outcomes: DOACs \nvs. VKAs in patients with AF and cardiac amyloidosis (CA).

DiscussionThe present study investigated the effect of anticoagulation therapy—DOACs \nversus VKAs—in patients with CA and AF. In terms of embolic events, three of \nthe included studies [13, 14, 15] reported no significant difference between DOACs and VKAs, \nwhile one study [16] found that DOACs were associated with a lower risk of stroke. \nRegarding bleeding complications, two studies [13, 14] observed similar rates between the \nDOAC and VKA cohorts, whereas the remaining two studies [15, 16] reported a higher \nfrequency of bleeding events in the VKA group. In the pooled quantitative \nanalysis, DOACs were associated with a reduced risk of thromboembolic events \ncompared to VKAs, with no significant difference observed in the incidence of \nmajor bleeding. These findings support the safe and effective use of DOACs as a \nnon-inferior alternative to VKAs in patients with CA and AF.Renal function emerged as a significant confounding factor influencing outcomes \nin anticoagulation therapy. Patients with impaired renal function were more \nlikely to be prescribed VKAs since DOACs such as edoxaban and dabigatran are \ncontraindicated in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) \nbelow 15 and 30 mL/min respectively [17, 18]. Consequently, the VKA group \ninherently comprised individuals with poorer renal function, which predisposed \nthem to a higher risk of bleeding. Therefore, the increased incidence of bleeding \nevents in the VKA group may not be directly attributed to the drug itself, but \nrather to the confounding effects of reduced renal function. The association was \nunderscored by the findings of Cariou et al. [15], where the apparent \nsuperiority of DOACs over VKAs in reducing all-cause mortality observed in \nunivariate analysis was no longer significant after adjusting to age, cardiac, \nand renal function. Furthermore, in the ATTRwt subpopulation, reduced eGFR was \nidentified as the sole variable significantly associated with all-cause \nmortality.The cohort study by Mitrani et al. [14] included patients diagnosed \nprior to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)’s approval of dabigatran, the first DOAC, in 2010. As a result, \npatients treated before 2010 would have received VKAs regardless of their kidney \nfunction as DOACs were not yet available. In contrast, more recent studies showed \nthat patients with preserved renal function were more likely to be prescribed \nDOACs [13, 15, 16]. Therefore, the VKA arm in Mitrani et al.’s [14] cohort likely \npresented with superior renal function compared to those in newer studies, \npotentially contributing to the more balanced outcomes reported in this study. \nHowever, the study did not report the exact exact average eGFR for either group, \nlimiting further comparisons.In the study by Cariou et al. [15], two additional types of VKAs, \nfluindione and acenocoumarol, were used alongside warfarin. Fluindione is \npredominantly prescribed in France, accounted for 80% of VKA prescriptions in \nthe country [19]. Fluindione is an indanedione derivative contrary to \nwarfarin and acenocoumarol, which are coumarin derivatives [20]. It is regarded \nas an interesting alternative to warfarin due to its longer half-life, which \nmight be a useful attribute in stabilizing the international normalized ratio \n(INR). Acenocoumarol is a drug that has some geographical tendencies, is more \ncommonly used in specific European countries, such as Spain and the Netherlands \n[21], but rarely prescribed in North America or Asia. The half-life of this drug \nis shorter than warfarin, theoretically making adjustments of INR more \nchallenging. A study suggests that warfarin’s longer half-life offers no \nsignificant clinical advantage [22], and acenocoumarol has been associated with \nmore stable anticoagulation effects. Yet, the inclusion of these two less-studied \nVKAs raises the question of whether the findings achieved by Cariou et \nal. [15] could be extrapolated to warfarin or VKAs as a class, given their \npharmacological differences.AL and ATTR amyloidosis are two distinct conditions within the amyloidosis \nspectrum, each exhibiting distinct characteristics, particularly in terms of \nthromboembolic risk [23]. AL amyloidosis results from neoplastic plasma cells \nproducing misfolded unstable free light chains [23] that could deposit in \nvirtually any organ, and are not limited to the heart. Common extracardiac \nmanifestations include renal failure, elevated liver enzymes, gastrointestinal \nsymptoms, macroglossia, and autonomic dysfunction [24]. In AL patients, renal \ndysfunction is often a direct consequence of disease progression rather than \nheart failure. Nephrotic syndrome, associated with urinary loss of anticoagulant \nfactors (e.g., antithrombin, protein S), immunomodulatory drug use, high free \nlight chain levels, and elevated beta-2 microglobulin levels, collectively \nincrease thromboembolic risk. At the same time, renal failure and increased \nvessel fragility caused by amyloid deposition elevate the risk of bleeding [25].On the other hand, ATTR amyloidosis follows a distinct pathogenic pathway, \nprimarily involving cardiac amyloid deposition [26]. Transthyretin, a tetrameric \nprotein produced by the liver, functions as a transporter for thyroxine and \nretinol-binding protein. Mutations in the amyloidogenic genes destabilize the \ntetramer structure, leading to abnormal protein misfolding [27], aggregation, and \nfibril formation. In wild-type ATTR amyloidosis, the misfolded non-mutated \ntransthyretin proteins assemble into soluble oligomers, which are prone to \nforming amyloid fibrils [27]. These insoluble fibrils accumulate in various \norgans, particularly in the elderly, resulting in wild-type amyloidosis [27]. \nUnlike AL amyloidosis, ATTR typically does not involve other vital organs or the \nuse of immunomodulatory drugs, resulting in comparatively lower thrombotic and \nbleeding risks.DOACs are contraindicated in patients receiving chemotherapy regimens containing \ndexamethasone. Both rivaroxaban and apixaban are primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 \nin the liver. Dexamethasone, a known Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inducer, increases the enzyme’s \nexpression, thereby accelerating the metabolism of these DOACs [28]. This reduces \nanticoagulant levels, potentially leading to subtherapeutic anticoagulation [28]. \nIn the study by Cariou et al. [15], 69 patients with AL amyloidosis were \nanticoagulated, and only 15 receiving DOACs, indicating that AL patients were \nmore likely to be on warfarin. While the study did not provide specific \ninformation about chemotherapy in this cohort, the potential drug-drug \ninteraction between DOACs and dexamethasone likely contributed to this treatment \npattern.AL amyloidosis presents with higher prothrombotic and bleeding \nrisks, explaining the greater proportion of AL patients managed with \nwarfarin. However, warfarin is generally considered less effective and more \nchallenging to manage compared to DOACs. In contrast, ATTRwt develops as an \nage-related condition [29], and its diagnosis typically occurs at a significantly \nolder age AL amyloidosis. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is often associated with \nan advanced age [30], results in poorer renal function in the ATTRwt population. \nAlthough AL amyloidosis directly impacts renal function due to amyloid \ndeposition, the overall renal function in ATTRwt patients is often worse due to \nthe higher prevalence of age-related CKD in this group.DOACs offer several advantages over VKAs such as warfarin, including a wider \ntherapeutic window, shorter half-life, and reduced need for frequent INR \nmonitoring [31]. Maintaining a stable and therapeutic INR is a significant \nproblem when administering VKAs in CA patients, which highly depends on the \ncenter and patient’s adherence. In the study by Mitrani et al. [14], 87.5% of \nthe patients in the VKA group had a labile INR during follow-up, and all ischemic \nevents or major bleeding episodes occurred in patients with unstable INR levels. \nSimilarly, in the multicenter study by Vilches et al. [13], labile INR was \nobserved in 18.7% of patients treated with VKAs and was associated with a higher \nrate of embolic events. However, limitations in data, such as missing information \non INR stability and ejection fraction, reduce the credibility and \ngeneralizability of these findings.Once considered incurable, ATTR-CM has seen significant advancements with the \ndevelopment of novel disease-modifying therapies over the past decades. In 2019, \nthe FDA approved the first and only agent for ATTR-CM, tafamidis [32]. As \nadditional promising therapies are anticipated to gain approval and enter the \nmarket, there is a growing need to evaluate potential drug-drug interactions \nbetween these emerging agents and commonly used anticoagulants. However, none of \nthe existing studies have reported data on the use of chemotherapy or targeted \ntherapy agents in their patient populations. Future trials would benefit from \nincluding such details in their population demographics to provide more \ncomprehensive insights into these interactions.4.1 Sub-population of AL PatientsOnly one [15] of the studies included AL patients in their population, whereas \nall the other studies either only focused on ATTR patients [13, 14] or did not \nreport the specific amyloidosis subtypes [16]. In the sub-population analysis of \nAL patients, there was no difference in bleeding events between the two \nanticoagulation treatments, and no association between types of anticoagulants \nand all-cause mortality was found.4.2 Strengths and LimitationsBy critically evaluating the current evidence, our review provides valuable \ninsights for clinicians managing AF in patients with CA. This research holds \nparticular significance as it can assist healthcare providers in making informed \ndecisions regarding the selection and administration of anticoagulant therapy in \nthis complex and high-risk patient population.Several limitations of this review must be considered. First, all four included \nstudies were retrospective in design, which introduces inherent limitations, \nincluding susceptibility to selection bias, confounding variables, poorly \nestablished temporal relationships, and the potential for low-quality data. \nConsequently, our findings should be interpreted with caution. Second, no \nrandomized controlled trials (RCTs) have specifically compared DOACs and VKAs in \nAF patients with CA. High-quality RCTs are needed to provide more definitive \nevidence and to support robust clinical recommendations. Third, limited data \navailability prevented us from performing a subgroup analysis based on individual \nCA subtypes such as ATTR and AL. Fourth, advanced statistical techniques to \naccount for key confounders, such as meta-regression, were not feasible due to \nthe small number of studies included. Finally, due to the limited number of \nstudies, we did not formally assess publication bias in this review. According to \nCochrane guidelines, a funnel plot is generally considered appropriate when at \nleast ten studies are available. The small sample size raises the possibility of \npublication bias, as unpublished studies with null or negative results may have \nbeen omitted from the literature, limiting the robustness and generalizability of \nour findings. Future research should include additional studies to enable formal \npublication bias assessments and enhance the reliability and robustness of the \nevidence on the safety and efficacy of DOACs versus VKAs in AF patients with CA.5. ConclusionsExisting studies support the use of DOACs as a non-inferior therapeutic option \ncompared to VKAs for preventing thromboembolism in patients with AF and CA. DOACs \noffer practical advantages, such as reduced monitoring requirements and a lower \nlikelihood of labile anticoagulation. However, the evidence remains limited by \nthe retrospective nature of current studies and the lack of RCTs. Further \nprospective trials are essential to confirm these findings and to establish \nrobust clinical guidelines tailored to the unique challenges of anticoagulation \nin this high-risk population.Availability of Data and MaterialsThe datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request."}

Study quality was evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Analyses included pairwise meta-analyses via Review Manager 5.4 and network meta-analyses via Stata 14.0.ResultsA total of 32 RCTs involving 2370 participants were included. Dual cognitive task training had the most significant impact on global cognition (SUCRA = 79.2%, mean rank = 1.6) and motor-cognitive dual task training was the only dual task intervention with a notable improvement in executive function (SMD = 1.53, 95% CI 0.06–3.01). For physical function, dual motor task training was most effective, improving gait performance (SMD = 0.34), muscle strength (SMD = 0.28), and balance (SMD = 0.90). Motor-cognitive dual task training demonstrated the greatest effectiveness in enhancing activities of daily living (SMD = 1.50) and quality of life (SMD = 1.20), while reducing depressive symptoms (SMD = − 0.96).ConclusionsDual cognitive task training is the most effective dual task intervention for enhancing global cognition. Motor-cognitive dual task training is the only dual task mode that significantly improves executive cognition.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s40520-025-03016-5.", "body": "IntroductionAs global life expectancy rises and the aging population expands, the incidence of age-related cognitive impairment among older adults is escalating. It is currently estimated that over 55 million people worldwide suffer from dementia, and over 10 million new cases are identified each year [1]. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), dementia significantly impairs cognitive function in older adults, reducing their ability to perform activities of daily living (ADL), and is a major contributor to disability and reliance among this population globally [2]. Progressive cognitive decline contributes to diminished physical abilities, such as slower walking speed and reduced lower-limb muscle strength, which in turn results in gait disturbances and decreased mobility in patients with dementia [3]. Therefore, cognitive decline often coexists with physical frailty. Frailty is characterized by the cumulative decline of multiple physiological systems, manifested by unintentional weight loss, self-reported exhaustion, weakness, slow walking speed, and low physical activity [4]. This combination of cognitive decline and physical frailty is referred to as cognitive frailty [5]. Moreover, cognitive deterioration frequently coincides with impairments in ADL, adversely affecting the quality of life (QOL) for both individuals with dementia and their caregivers, while also placing significant economic and caregiving burdens on families and society [6, 7]. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) constitutes a transitional phase between normal age-related cognitive decline and dementia, marked by significant cognitive deficits that have not yet met the diagnostic threshold for dementia [8]. During this stage, individuals display noticeable cognitive impairments in complex functional tasks, yet they retain the ability to function independently in daily activities [9]. This period is crucial for implementing preventive interventions to halt the progression to dementia.Older adults with MCI and dementia face a broad array of challenges, including cognitive deficits, physical functional impairments, emotional disturbances, etc. Despite this, current pharmacological treatments for dementia, such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors like donepezil and memantine, offer only modest symptomatic relief and do not halt disease progression, with safety concerns and limited efficacy remaining significant challenges [10]. Given the limited high-quality evidence supporting pharmacological treatments for dementia, exploring effective non-drug interventions to slow cognitive deterioration is essential. Evidence suggests that cognitive and motor activity interventions represent effective non-pharmacological approaches to attenuating cognitive decline in individuals with MCI [11]. The study of Küster et al. [12] elucidate that they may impact cognitive functions through distinct biological mechanisms: physical activities elevate brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels which are essential for neuroplasticity, whereas cognitive training is linked to reductions in the neurotoxic metabolite 3-HK, potentially alleviating neuronal stress.Dual tasking consists of combining two different single tasks, involves performing two tasks, either sequentially or concurrently, leveraging concepts of motor skill acquisition or task relevance to efficiently handle multiple tasks. According to Campos-Magdaleno et al. [13], this study considers three distinct dual task pairings: motor-cognitive, dual motor, and dual cognitive. To distinguish ‘dual task’ from the execution of a complex single task, it is imperative that the dual task meets two primary criteria: (1) each component task can be independently performed and quantitatively assessed; and (2) each task possesses distinct objectives [14].Systematic reviews indicate that dual task training offers greater benefits compared to single cognitive or physical task training in reducing age-related cognitive decline [15]. Given the variety of dual task modalities available, it is crucial to discern which specific mode is most effective for improving cognitive and functional aspects in older adults with cognitive impairments. Moreover, cognitive-motor dual task interventions, as a novel approach, raise the question of whether their effects differ from those of traditional interventions that combine two cognitive or physical tasks under the same conditions. Consequently, we conducted this network meta-analysis to synthesize existing evidence and determine the most effective dual task interventions for enhancing cognitive function in older adults with MCI or dementia, thereby supporting evidence-based clinical decision-making.MethodsThis systematic review and network meta-analysis followed the PRISMA Extension for Network Meta-Analyses (PRISMA-NMA) guidelines to ensure a thorough and transparent presentation of the methodology and findings [16]. The study protocol was proactively registered at PROSPERO, registration number CRD42024550565, before the initiation of data extraction and analysis. As this study was a meta-analysis, ethical approval and consent to participate were not applicable.Data sources and search strategySearches were conducted in both English and Chinese databases, including PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, CINAHL, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database and VIP, from their inception to July 28, 2024. Our search strategy incorporated both subject words and free words. For instance, in searching for “Dementia”, we used the subject word “dementia” along with free words like “Cognitive Decline” and “Cognitive Impairment”. To ensure the inclusion of all pertinent studies, we manually searched the reference lists of systematic reviews related to the topic published in the last five years. The detailed search strategy is presented in Supplementary Appendix 1.Selection criteriaInitially, duplicate records were removed using EndNote X9 software (Clarivate Analytics, Philadelphia, PA, USA). Following this, two researchers (YH and YZ) independently screened the titles and abstracts. Studies that met the inclusion criteria were then subjected to a detailed assessment by both reviewers. In cases of disagreement or discrepancies, a third author was consulted to achieve consensus. The specific inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) Participants: Older adults aged 60 and older who have been clinically diagnosed with MCI or dementia. (2) Interventions: Each intervention program must employ one of the following dual task modes: dual cognitive task training (involving two cognitive task interventions), dual motor task training (involving two motor task interventions), or motor-cognitive dual task training (involving one motor and one cognitive task intervention), whether these tasks are performed simultaneously or sequentially. In order to include as many trials as possible, this study did not set limits on the type, dose, duration, intensity or frequency of the intervention. (3) Comparison: Control interventions may include single-task physical or cognitive activity, usual care, waiting lists, health education, placebo training or dual task modes similar to interventions. (4) Outcomes: The primary outcome focused on global cognition, secondary outcomes included executive function, memory function, depressive symptoms, ADL, gait performance, muscle strength, QOL, and balance. Studies were included if they reported either the primary outcome (global cognition) or at least one of the secondary outcomes. (5) Study design: only randomized controlled trials were included. Articles meeting the following criteria will be excluded: (1) Studies published in languages other than English or Chinese. (2) Studies involving additional interventions with potential cognitive therapeutic effects, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy or reminiscence therapy. (3) Conference abstracts, reviews, study protocols, and letters to the editor. (4) Studies were excluded if they had incomplete data that precluded comprehensive analysis or assessment of outcomes. (5) When multiple articles reported results from the same study, only the most recently published article was included.Data extractionData were independently extracted by two reviewers using a predefined standardized form, with discrepancies resolved by consensus. Extracted information included: (1) Country and year of publication; (2) Sample characteristics, including type of disease, sample size, mean age, gender distribution, baseline cognitive function of participants. (3) Intervention details, including components of physical or cognitive interventions, combination forms, duration, frequency, and total intervention length. (4) The control measures used for comparison. (5) Information on outcomes, including global cognition, executive function, memory function, depressive symptoms, activities of daily living, gait performance, muscle strength, QOL and balance performance. We assessed baseline comparability across included studies and excluded any studies that did not clearly report baseline characteristics. If data were not reported in the articles, efforts were made to contact the original authors to obtain the missing information. When standard deviations (SDs) were not reported, they were derived from available standard errors (SEs), confidence intervals (CIs), t or p values. We also reached out to the authors via email to obtain any missing data. Additionally, when data were presented only graphically but not reported numerically, we utilized GetData Graph Digitizer version 2.20 to extract the necessary information from the graphs. In instances where both unadjusted and adjusted data were provided, the analysis incorporated the adjusted data to ensure the accuracy and relevance of our findings.Risk of biasThe risk of bias in the included studies was evaluated by two independent reviewers using the Cochrane Collaboration’s risk of bias tool. Given that it was not possible to blind participants during the implementation of the motor or cognitive interventions, we assessed only the other 6 categories of risk bias included in the study, which included random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of the outcome assessor, incomplete data, selective reporting, and other sources of bias (such as baseline imbalance and funding bias) [17].Data analysisPairwise meta-analyses were conducted using Review Manager 5.4 provided by the Cochrane Collaboration. Network meta-analyses were carried out using the Network package in STATA (Version 14.0; StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA), employing a random-effects model based on a frequency-domain framework [18]. The mean difference and standard deviation of the required data were extracted or calculated from the included studies, and the standardized mean difference (SMD) along with the 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to summarize the effect size [19]. For studies using multiple neuropsychological tests to assess the same outcomes, we selected the most commonly utilized test as the representative measure to ensure consistency and comparability across studies. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Q test and I2, with a Q test of p < 0.1 or I2 ≥ 50%. In such cases, a random-effects model was employed; otherwise, a fixed-effects model was used.Network diagrams were employed to assess the structure of the intervention network and potential biases. In these diagrams, each node represents an intervention, with the node size reflecting the sample size. Lines connecting the nodes, with thickness representing the number of studies, illustrate direct comparisons between interventions [20]. Inconsistency within the network was assessed using a global inconsistency test. A nonsignificant result (p > 0.05) indicated that the direct and indirect evidence were coherent, thereby justifying the use of a consistency model for further analysis [21]. Local inconsistency was further evaluated using the node-splitting method, which compares direct and indirect estimates for specific comparisons within the network [22]. The network geometry is depicted in a network graph, and the relative effect estimates of pairwise comparisons are summarized in a league table. Loop inconsistency tests were performed to verify the consistency of direct and indirect evidence across various loops [23]. Using the Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking Curve (SUCRA), we quantified the impact of various interventions on cognitive function in elderly patients with mild cognitive impairment or dementia. Values on the SUCRA scale range from 0 to 100%, with higher percentages indicating a higher probability that an intervention is the most effective. Funnel plots were employed to assess publication bias, visualizing the symmetry of effect sizes relative to their standard errors across studies [22].ResultsStudy selectionDatabase searches initially identified 11,746 records, with an additional 34 articles obtained from the reference lists of systematic reviews related to the topic published in the last five years. After deduplication, 10,622 records remained. Subsequent screening of titles and abstracts excluded 10,551 records, leaving 71 articles for full-text review. Of these, 39 records were further excluded due to various reasons: ineligible participants (n = 2), inappropriate interventions (n = 7), lack of relevant outcome indicators (n = 23), non-RCTs (n = 4), and absence of full text (n = 3). Ultimately, 32 RCTs were included in the study. The specific PRISMA-NMA flow diagram is shown in Fig. 1.Fig. 1The specific PRISMA-NMA flow diagramThe overview of all included studiesTable 1 presents the characteristics of the included studies. All dual task intervention combinations included in the study included a cognitive-motor dual task intervention (n = 16, primarily a combination of aerobic and memory tasks), a dual motor task intervention (n = 11, primarily a combination of aerobic and strength training), and a dual cognitive task intervention (n = 5, primarily a combination of memory training and executive function training). Intervention durations varied from 4 to 26 weeks; most studies (n = 20, 62.5%) conducted interventions that lasted no less than 12 months, with the most common duration being 12 weeks (n = 9, 28.13%). Session lengths ranged from 10 to 100 min, with 30 min sessions being the most frequent (n = 15, 46.9%). The interventions were conducted between once and seven times per week, with biweekly sessions being the most common frequency (n = 12, 37.5%).

The remaining 9 studies [47–55] were evaluated and classified as low concern. The overall risk of bias assessment across all included studies is summarized in Supplementary Appendix 3, and the detailed risk of bias assessments for each individual study are provided in Supplementary Appendix 4.Traditional pairwise meta-analysisIn traditional pairwise meta-analyses, motor-cognitive dual task training, dual motor task training, and dual cognitive task training all showed significant effects in global cognition and memory function in older adults with MCI or dementia compared with control interventions. Dual cognitive task training emerged as the most potent, enhancing global cognition significantly (n = 3, sample sizes 37 vs 36, SMD = 1.15, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.66). Motor-cognitive dual task training was also significant in improving executive function (SMD = 1.40, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.36) and depressive symptoms (SMD = − 0.95, 95% CI − 1.44 to − 0.46), whereas there were no significant differences from controls in ADL (SMD = 1.47, 95% CI − 0.05 to 2.99), gait performance (SMD = − 0.15, 95% CI − 0.43 to 0.14) and balance (SMD = 0.23, 95% CI − 0.08 to 0.54). Dual motor task training had significantly more benefits in improving physical function, with significant effects in improving ADL (SMD = 0.42, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.55), gait performance (SMD = 0.35, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.67), muscle strength (SMD = 0.72, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.07) and balance (SMD = 0.47, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.62) in older adults with cognitive impairments. More details are shown in Supplementary Appendix 5.Network meta-analysisWe conducted a network meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of various dual task intervention methods on eight outcome measures. These measures span 4 domains: cognitive domains (including global cognition, executive function, and memory function), physical function (encompassing ADL, gait performance, muscle strength, and balance), depressive symptoms and QOL. The network diagram for cognitive domains is presented in Fig. 2, while the diagrams for the remaining eight outcomes are in Supplementary Appendix 6. Of all the studies, the control group had the largest sample size (890 participants), followed by dual motor task training (738 participants), motor-cognitive dual task training (392 participants), and dual cognitive task training (37 participants). Loop inconsistency tests supported the overall consistency of the network, confirming coherent results across key cognitive outcomes such as global cognition, memory function, and executive function.Fig. 2The network diagram for cognitive function: A global cognition, B executive function, and C memory function. The node size correlates with the number of participants randomly assigned to each intervention, and the line thickness between two nodes reflects the quantity of RCTs comparing those interventionsCognitive domainsFigure 2 displays the network diagram for cognitive domains, including outcomes for global cognition, executive function, and memory function. The instruments used for measuring global cognition included the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog), Computerized Assessment of Mild Cognitive Impairment (CAMCI), 7 Minute Screening, Neurobehavioral Cognitive Status Examination (NCSE) and Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Examination-Revised (ACE-R). Table 2 presents the estimated effects of each intervention on cognitive function as derived from the network meta-analysis. The network meta-analysis revealed that motor-cognitive dual task training (SMD = 0.73, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.16), dual motor task training (SMD = 0.86, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.35), and dual cognitive task training (SMD = 1.09, 95% CI 0.12 to 2.06) all significantly improve global cognition compared to the control group. Figure 3 illustrates the SUCRA for each intervention type in enhancing cognitive function. Results highlight that dual cognitive task training is the most effective intervention for improving global cognition in elderly patients with MCI and dementia (SUCRA = 79.2%, mean rank = 1.6), followed by dual motor task training (SUCRA = 67.4%, mean rank = 2.0), motor-cognitive dual task training (SUCRA = 52.8%, mean rank = 2.4), and the control group (SUCRA = 0.6%, mean rank = 4). Inconsistency within the network meta-analysis was evaluated using loop-specific tests, revealing minimal inconsistency in the assessment of global cognition with an inconsistency factor of 0.21 (95% CI 0.00 to 2.03) and heterogeneity (τ2) of 0.376, suggesting coherent direct and indirect comparisons. Funnel plot analysis for publication bias showed no significant asymmetry, indicating the findings are robust and free from publication bias. Further details on these analyses are provided in Supplementary Appendices 9 and 10.Table 2Results of the comparative effectiveness for (A) global cognition, (B) executive function, and (C) memory function are presentedADual cognitive task training0.23 (− 0.86, 1.32)Dual motor task training0.36 (− 0.70, 1.42)0.13 (− 0.48, 0.74)Motor-cognitive dual task training1.09 (0.12, 2.06)0.86 (0.38, 1.35)0.73 (0.31, 1.16)ControlBDual motor task training0.19 (− 2.11, 2.49)Motor-cognitive dual task training0.05 (− 4.57, 4.67)− 0.14 (− 4.41, 4.13)Dual cognitive task training1.72 (− 0.57, 4.02)1.53 (0.06, 3.01)1.67 (− 2.33, 5.68)ControlCDual cognitive task training0.35 (− 1.78, 2.49)Motor-cognitive dual task training0.88 (− 1.36, 3.12)0.53 (− 0.98, 2.03)Dual motor task training1.44 (− 0.36, 3.24)1.08 (− 0.07, 2.23)0.56 (−0.78, 1.89)ControlLeague table showing the relative effect estimates of different dual task interventions on A: global cognition; B: executive cognition; C: memory function.

Abbreviations: Dual cognitive, dual cognitive task training; Dual motor, dual motor task training; Motor-cognitive, motor-cognitive dual task trainingRegarding executive function, motor-cognitive task training significantly outperformed the control group (SMD = 1.53, 95% CI 0.06 to 3.01), while dual motor task training (SMD = 1.72, 95% CI − 0.57 to 4.02) and dual cognitive task training (SMD = 1.67, 95% CI − 2.33 to 5.68) did not show significant differences compared to the control group. Moreover, the result showed that, no significant differences were observed in any pairwise comparisons for memory cognition.Physical functionDual motor task training demonstrates considerable efficacy within the sphere of physical function. Dual motor task training demonstrated superior improvements in gait performance compared to both the control group (SMD = 0.34, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.56) and motor-cognitive dual task training (SMD = 0.48, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.78), and achieved the highest probability of ranking best (SUCRA = 63.8%, mean rank = 1.7). Dual motor task training also emerged as the only intervention to manifest a significant improvement in muscle strength over the control group (SMD = 0.28, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.45). Furthermore, it was the only intervention that exhibited an improvement in balance compared to the control group (SMD = 0.90, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.71). Notably, studies on dual cognitive task training were excluded from the analysis above as they did not report on these specific physical function outcomes. For ADL, motor-cognitive dual task training was the only intervention that demonstrated a significant improvement compared to the control group, with a substantial effect size (SMD = 1.50, 95% CI 0.50 to 2.50).Depressive symptoms and quality of lifeThe network for depressive symptoms consisted of nine studies comparing 4 treatments. In addressing depressive symptoms, motor-cognitive dual task training significantly surpassed the control group, achieving a notable reduction in symptom severity (SMD = − 0.96, 95% CI − 1.51 to − 0.41), which suggests its potential utility in managing depressive conditions among the elderly. Regarding QOL, motor-cognitive dual task training also demonstrated more pronounced improvements compared to both the control and dual motor task training (SMD = 1.20 and 1.31, respectively). Forest plots of the pairwise network meta-analysis results for all outcome measures are detailed in Supplementary Appendix 7, with the SUCRAs and the league tables presented in Supplementary Appendix 8.DiscussionMain findings and interpretationOur findings reveal that all evaluated dual task interventions are promising for improving global cognition relative to the control group. Consistent with previous research, dual task training has been demonstrated to confer benefits on cognitive functions in populations with dementia or MCI, particularly in attention [56]. The results suggest that dual cognitive task training is potentially the most effective for improving global cognition, followed by dual motor task training and motor-cognitive dual task training. Dual cognitive task training typically involves memory training combined with other training such as arithmetic calculation, attention, executive function, and language exercises, using both digital tools like RehaCom Cognitive Therapy Software and traditional methods like paper and pencil exercises. It is hypothesized that such training fosters cognitive and brain reserves, which confer increased resilience against neuropathological impacts [57]. Dual cognitive task training, characterized by repetitive and targeted cognitive exercises, is likely to induce more profound neuroplastic changes compared to dual motor tasks and motor-cognitive dual tasks. These neuroplastic changes enhance neural efficiency, thereby more directly influencing global cognition [41]. Given these findings, healthcare providers can implement dual cognitive task interventions for older adults with MCI or dementia to improve their global cognition. In community settings, healthcare providers can offer flexible and accessible interventions by integrating dual cognitive training into daily activities. For example, community centers could facilitate activities that combine memory exercises with group storytelling or collaborative puzzles, which can be easily implemented by community health nurses or caregivers. These activities not only enhance cognitive function but also promote social interaction and mental well-being among older adults. On the other hand, in long-term care settings, where residents often have more severe cognitive impairments and limited mobility, structured and guided interventions may be more appropriate. Digital dual cognitive training programs can be introduced to guide patients through structured exercises, providing a standardized and scalable approach to dual cognitive task interventions.Furthermore, only motor-cognitive dual task training showed significant improvements in executive functions, as verified by previous systematic review [15]. This effect can be attributed to the fact that motor-cognitive dual task training necessitates the simultaneous execution of cognitive tasks and physical activities. This dual engagement likely activates both motor and cognitive control networks within the brain, stimulating regions involved in task coordination and problem-solving, including the prefrontal cortex, which is pivotal for executive functions. In terms of enhancing memory function, our analysis did not detect significant differences between any dual task intervention and the control group. However, a systematic review has pointed out that computerized cognitive training (CCT) can improve specific memory domains in MCI participants, such as verbal, visual, and working memory [58]. This study employed a variety of cognitive tasks targeting multiple cognitive domains, which did not meet our inclusion criteria since we only accepted studies explicitly involving two cognitive tasks and excluded those with three or more. This highlights that interventions incorporating a broader range of cognitive tasks may be more beneficial for managing and improving memory functions. Future research should explore the effectiveness of multifaceted cognitive task interventions in enhancing memory performance.Psychological symptoms and functional status are also recognized as critical goals in dementia care [59]. Consequently, it is also essential to examine the effects of dual task interventions on these important non-cognitive outcomes. Our study demonstrates that dual motor task training significantly improves physical function in older adults with cognitive impairments, evidenced by marked improvements in gait performance, muscle strength, and balance compared to control conditions. Dual motor tasks may be particularly effective in improving physical function due to their emphasis on repetitive functional movements [60]. Such movements directly target specific motor patterns, reinforcing neuromuscular coordination and enhancing muscle memory. By repeatedly practicing functional tasks, such as walking or balancing exercises, dual motor tasks strengthen the neural pathways associated with these activities, leading to more efficient motor control and better physical performance. Furthermore, consistent with recent research [61], our findings did not observe significant improvements in physical function such as gait performance and balance from motor-cognitive dual task training. This may be due to the fact that improvements in balance primarily depend on specific motor exercises designed to enhance sensorimotor integration and neuromuscular coordination. However, another systematic review [62] reported that motor-cognitive dual task training led to improvements in gait performance among older adults with cognitive impairment. This could be attributed to their exclusive focus on simultaneous tasks, in contrast to our study which included both simultaneous and sequential tasks. Furthermore, our results suggest that motor-cognitive dual task training may be particularly effective in improving ADL and quality of life. This could be attributed to the inherent requirements of ADLs, which typically necessitate the simultaneous execution of multiple tasks demanding both high motor and cognitive resources, and motor-cognitive dual task training could enhance the neural and motor coordination needed for these multitasking demands [63].While dual motor task training or motor-cognitive dual task training may not match the efficacy of dual cognitive task training in improving global cognition, they significantly enhance overall functional abilities, especially in terms of non-cognitive outcomes. Integrating physical exercises into dual task training regimes not only supports cognitive rehabilitation but also substantially increases functional capacity through the enhancement of strength and balance. These benefits are critical in mitigating the risk of falls and combating other age-related deteriorations in functional abilities, thereby extending considerable health advantages to the elderly population.Strengths and limitationsThis study is the first network meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of various dual task mode interventions on cognitive functions in older adults with mild cognitive impairment or dementia, employing a rigorous and comprehensive search strategy limited to randomized controlled trials for the highest level of evidence. Compared to previous systematic reviews on the effectiveness of dual task training for cognitively impaired older adults, our study further categorized dual task types, applied more stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria, and analyzed the comparative effects between different dual task combined interventions. However, some limitations should be noted. Firstly, the study’s scope was restricted to articles published in English and Chinese, potentially introducing selection bias due to the exclusion of studies in other languages, additional sources, and grey literature. Secondly, variations in intervention intensity, duration, and frequency across included studies may have introduced heterogeneity and potential confounding, limiting the ability to precisely compare effectiveness across intervention types. Additionally, for certain outcome categories (global cognition, QOL, and ADLs), the sample size in one study [52] may have dominated the network meta-analysis, necessitating a cautious interpretation of these results. Finally, the limited sample sizes in original studies on dual cognitive task training precluded further subgroup analysis to identify optimal intervention frequencies and durations.This study is the first network meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of various dual task mode interventions on cognitive functions in older adults with mild cognitive impairment or dementia, employing a rigorous and comprehensive search strategy limited to randomized controlled trials for the highest level of evidence.

Dual motor tasks are particularly effective in improving physical function, whereas motor-cognitive dual tasks are most beneficial for enhancing quality of life, ADL, as well as alleviating depression symptoms. Healthcare providers should, therefore, tailor these approaches based on specific patient needs to promote overall health in individuals at preclinical and clinical stages of dementia. To support the effective implementation and dissemination of the relevant interventions, the next step could be to consider the establishment of multidisciplinary teams comprising, for example, neurologists, physiotherapists and geriatric specialist nurses. Pilot projects funded by health policymakers could evaluate the feasibility of these interventions across different community settings, thereby providing crucial data to refine and optimize care programs. In addition, health authorities could consider incorporating dual task training into health guidelines for dementia care to ensure that these beneficial interventions receive the attention and funding needed for widespread adoption. Such strategic integration is expected to greatly enhance the management of dementia and potentially aid its development in community settings.Supplementary InformationBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material.Supplementary file1 (DOCX 2498 KB)"}
{"PMCID": "12111995", "title": "Meta-Analytic Review of Coronary Angiography in Peri-Procedural Myocardial Injury and Infarction After Cardiac Surgery", "abstract": "Introduction: Peri-procedural myocardial infarction (PMI) after cardiac surgery is a significant yet often under-recognised complication, sometimes necessitating urgent coronary angiography (PMI-rCA). This meta-analysis evaluates its prevalence, angiographic findings, management strategies, and associated mortality. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. Data from nine studies comprising 104,445 post-cardiac surgery patients were analysed. Among them, those undergoing PMI-rCA were categorised by treatment strategy: conservative management, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), or reperform surgery. A network meta-analysis compared mortality risks across these groups, with findings visualised using forest plots, network diagrams, and SUCRA rankings. Results: PMI-rCA was performed in 1205 patients (2%). Of these, 34.3% had no significant angiographic abnormalities, 53.7% exhibited graft failure, and 10.4% had native vessel ischemia. Management strategies included conservative treatment (55.5%), PCI (23.5%), and reperforming surgery (21%). Network meta-analysis indicated that conservative management was associated with the lowest mortality risk, followed by PCI, while reperforming surgery had the highest risk. Discussion: These findings highlight the complexity of PMI diagnosis and treatment. The high proportion of patients without significant angiographic abnormalities raises concerns about potential overuse of invasive procedures. Meanwhile, PCI appears to be a more favourable interventional strategy than reperforming surgery in terms of mortality outcomes. Conclusions: PMI requiring coronary angiography is uncommon but clinically significant, with a 16% mortality rate. A tailored, risk-based approach is essential to optimise management, balancing conservative therapy, PCI, and reperforming surgery based on individual patient profiles.", "body": "1. IntroductionInvasive coronary angiography is not uncommon after cardiac surgery; it is estimated that 1–5% of patients may require an urgent/emergent coronary angiography in the first 30 days after surgery [1]. The clinical indications are different (graft failure, injury or peri-operative infarction, coronary obstruction after valve surgery, ischemia-triggered arrhythmias) and ICA remains the diagnostic gold standard, especially when intervention is needed in the context of PMI/type 5 infarction. Type 5 myocardial infarction (PMI) following cardiac surgery remains a poorly understood and under-recognised condition despite its prognostic significance. Unlike type 1 (spontaneous MI) or type 2 (supply–demand imbalance MI), PMI lacks a standardised diagnostic and therapeutic approach and is a key secondary outcome in comparisons between surgical and percutaneous revascularisation strategies [2]. The definition of Type 5 myocardial infarction varies among different classification systems used for defining PMI, as each criterion uses different biomarker thresholds (cTn or CK-MB) within 48 h post-procedure. The variability between high-sensitivity troponin assays (hs-cTnT and hs-cTnI) and arbitrarily set reference limits makes uniform classification challenging. Therefore, a revision of the peri-procedural myocardial infarction (PMI) definition has been proposed, incorporating more standardised thresholds, imaging evidence, and greater clinical context [3].The definitions of myocardial injury, type 5 myocardial infarction, and ischemia are inherently overlapping, with subtle interpretative nuances. While myocardial injury is identified by isolated troponin elevation, type 5 MI requires substantial biomarker increase and definitive ischemic evidence; ischemia itself reflects impaired perfusion, not necessarily necrosis. In peri-operative settings, procedural trauma and hemodynamic variability further obscure these boundaries, introducing bias and complicating outcome assessment in clinical research.Beyond definitions, PMI presents a complex clinical scenario influenced by both patient-specific factors and procedural complications. Etiologies range from ischemia, plaque rupture, and graft failure to thrombus formation, coronary spasm, or extrinsic compression by a prosthetic valve [4]. Clinical presentation often overlaps with other cardiac conditions, manifesting as chest pain, ECG changes, echocardiographic abnormalities, arrhythmias, or hemodynamic instability. Many patients have complex coronary anatomies, multiple comorbidities (e.g., renal dysfunction, diabetes, heart failure), and delayed biomarker detection due to peri-operative factors [5]. Management remains controversial, balancing conservative and interventional strategies, often in hemodynamically unstable patients requiring inotropes or mechanical support [6]. Coronary angiography is crucial but lacks clear indications, varying by institutional protocols and clinical status. Paradoxically, coronary angiography fails to identify a culprit lesion in one-third of cases but guides revascularisation (PCI or redo surgery) in nearly half of patients. Given its impact on outcomes, PMI demands a multidisciplinary approach integrating serial ECGs, biomarkers, non-invasive imaging (e.g., coronary CT), and advanced circulatory support [7]. The arbitrary definition of PMI, increasingly sensitive cardiac markers with increased risk of false positives, the limitations of instrumental diagnostics in the postoperative context, the lack of studies, and the absence of specific guidelines, make PMI a controversial research area of modern cardiology. The purpose of this meta-analysis is to fill, with all the limitations of our study, this clinically relevant knowledge gap [8].2. Methods2.1. AimsThis study aimed to estimate the prevalence of patients with post-procedural myocardial infarction (PMI) requiring coronary angiography (PMI-rCA) and assess the estimated mortality rate reported in the included observational studies. Additionally, it sought to compare mortality rates based on treatment modality, including conservative management, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), or reperforming surgery, and to identify study-level variables associated with PMI prevalence and mortality.2.2. MethodologyThe meta-analysis and its preliminary methodology were registered on PROSPERO (ID: 646120).This study followed the PICO framework as follows:Population (P): Patients with PMI.Intervention (I): Undergoing coronary angiography.Comparator (C): Treatment strategy (conservative vs. interventional/surgical therapy).Outcome (O): Mortality.Observational studies were identified using a predefined key search strategy. A total of 13,084 records were identified through database and registry searches. Following the PRISMA 2020 guidelines, after screening and full-text assessment, 9 studies were included in the review. No randomised controlled trials were identified, as illustrated in Figure A1 (Appendix A).The identification, screening, and inclusion process is reported in Appendix A, Table A1. Patients undergoing coronary angiography after cardiac surgery were included; the distinction between injury and myocardial infarction is beyond the scope of this meta-analysis. Two authors (AC and MR) independently performed the study selection process. Any discrepancies were resolved with the assistance of a third reviewer (AF). The literature search was conducted in PubMed and Google Scholar. Data extraction was performed using Excel 365, and only studies that reported mortality stratified by treatment type were included. While most studies exhibited a low overall risk of bias, Hultgren et al. (2016), Rupprecht et al. (2019), and Sharma et al. (2021) showed a higher risk profile, with moderate concerns in multiple domains, particularly regarding intervention classification and outcome measurement. Risk of bias was assessed using the ROBINS-E tool, which evaluates potential biases across seven domains: bias due to confounding, bias in the selection of participants, bias in the classification of exposures, bias due to deviations from intended exposures, bias due to missing data, bias in the measurement of outcomes, and bias in the selection of the reported result (Appendix A, Figure A2). See clinical profile of patients included in Table 1 [9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17].The population analysed in this meta-analysis consisted of patients with peri-operative myocardial infarction after cardiac surgery who underwent coronary angiography. This population, defined by the acronym PMI-rCA (peri-operative myocardial infarction requiring coronary angiography), represents a subset of the broader PMI population. The present meta-analytic analysis specifically refers to the PMI-rCA population.2.3. Statistical AnalysisAt the study level, demographic data, clinical profiles, and types of cardiac surgery were collected (see Table 1). Coronary angiography findings were categorised as either non-pathological (“Normal Angiography”) or pathological. Patients with abnormal findings were further classified based on their treatment strategy, which included conservative management, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), or reperforming surgery. An overview of treatment pathways is provided in Figure 1, while the clinical characteristics of the meta-analytic population are detailed in Table 1 and Table A1 (Appendix A). Mortality was assessed for each subgroup and compared using a network meta-analysis.Qualitative data were expressed as percentages, while quantitative data were presented as means with standard deviations (SD). The effect size for PMI prevalence and mortality was estimated using the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) model, and heterogeneity was assessed through the I2 and the Q test. A random effects model was used for the meta-analysis, with results visualised through forest plots, normalised Q–Q plots for normal distribution assessment, and funnel plots to evaluate publication bias.Mortality analysis was conducted using a network meta-analysis, where conservative therapy served as the reference group in comparison with PCI and reperforming surgery. Binary mortality outcomes were reported as odds ratios (ORs) within a random-effects model. Results were further illustrated using network plots: the Litmus Rank-O-Gram and the Radial SUCRA plot [18]. Network meta-analysis results were summarized using the Litmus Rank-O-Gram and Radial SUCRA plot, graphical tools designed to improve the readability and interpretation of complex ranking data compared with traditional numerical tables. Meta-regression analyses were conducted for prevalence and mortality in the PMI-rCA population. In the network meta-analysis, the regression curves were all parallel/flat due to the limited power of the analysis at the study level; therefore, they were not reported. Statistical analyses were primarily conducted using STATA, while online tools such as metaHUN were employed for prevalence and mortality estimation, while MetaInsight was used for network meta-analysis visualiation.3. ResultsIn this meta-analysis, we included 104,445 patients who underwent cardiac surgery across nine studies. Among them, 1205 patients experienced post-procedural myocardial infarction (PMI-rCA) severe enough to require urgent coronary angiography. Of these, 413 patients showed no significant pathological findings, while 792 had abnormalities, and nearly 45% required some interventional or surgical treatment.When looking at overall survival, we found that 83% of these patients were alive at one year. The prevalence of PMI-rCA in this population was estimated at 2%, with a mortality rate of 16% among those requiring coronary angiography. Smaller studies tended to report higher prevalence and mortality rates compared with those with larger patient populations, suggesting a potential overestimation in smaller datasets (Figure 2, Figure 3 and Figure 4).Looking deeper into the clinical profiles, we found that the average age was 67 years with a female prevalence of 30%; 32.5% of patients were diabetic, and COPD comorbidity was present in 10% of cases. Overall, 36% of patients had a history of previous acute coronary syndrome, 25% of patients had already undergone PCI, and only 5% of patients had already undergone cardiac surgery. It was not possible to analyse the surgical risk in terms of standardised scores (see Table 1).One-third of patients had a reduced ejection fraction, and half underwent isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), while almost 7% had isolated valve surgery. A large proportion, 46% of the patients, had combined CABG and valve surgery, making this a significant subgroup. When looking at clinical presentation, ischemic ECG changes were more common than ventricular arrhythmias or instability, and a quarter of patients required circulatory support, primarily an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP).Coronary angiography revealed that more than half of the patients (53.7%) had graft failure, while in 10.4%, the issue lay in the native coronary arteries rather than the bypass grafts. Interestingly, one in three patients (34%) had no significant abnormalities on angiography despite their clinical presentation.We observed some notable trends in mortality outcomes when we analysed treatment strategies. Patients who underwent PCI tended to have higher mortality than those managed conservatively, and those who required surgery to be reperformed had the highest mortality of all. However, PCI still appeared to be a better option than reperforming surgery in terms of survival. The network meta-analysis confirmed these trends, showing that conservative management had the lowest mortality risk, followed by PCI, with reperforming surgery carrying the highest risk (Figure 5 and Figure A3 in the Appendix A).Using statistical models, including Litmus Rank-O-Gram and Radial SUCRA plots, we ranked treatment strategies based on cumulative survival probabilities. The results placed conservative treatment as the best-performing option, followed by PCI, and then reperforming surgery (Figure 6). These findings reinforce the idea that in this particular patient population more invasive interventions do not always translate into better outcomes.Finally, we explored what factors might predict PMI-rCA prevalence and mortality. Female sex did not seem to influence outcomes. However, CABG surgery was linked to higher PMI prevalence, while combined CABG and valve surgery was associated with increased mortality. Interestingly, having a reduced ejection fraction did not increase the likelihood of developing PMI, but it did correlate with a higher risk of death. The strongest predictor of mortality, however, was hemodynamic instability, which profoundly impacted patient outcomes. Additionally, arrhythmic events and hemodynamic instability often occurred together and were frequently seen in patients who had normal angiographic findings despite their symptoms (Figure A4 in the Appendix A) The meta-regression data within the network meta-analysis were not statistically significant due to the limited statistical power of the analysis. Therefore, it is currently not possible to determine whether clinical presentation variables (such as ST elevation, arrhythmias, or hemodynamic instability) influence the results of the network meta-analysis.4. DiscussionPost-procedural myocardial infarction (PMI) is often under-recognised and misunderstood in clinical practice. The distinction between myocardial injury and infarction remains unclear, but that does not make it any less significant from a prognostic standpoint. PMI is treated as an inevitable side effect of life-saving procedures, but ignoring PMI does not change the fact that even subclinical myocardial injury is increasingly linked to higher mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Rather than being overlooked “collateral damage”, PMI should be seen as an opportunity to better understand myocardial damage and improve outcomes [19].In the context of PMI, the difference between myocardial injury and infarction can be unclear. Myocardial injury is defined as an isolated rise in cardiac biomarkers above the upper reference limit, without evidence of myocardial ischemia. It may be due to procedural trauma, embolisation, or microvascular dysfunction but does not meet the criteria for infarction. The definition of myocardial infarction (PMI, Type 5 MI) requires biomarker elevation beyond a defined threshold plus at least one additional criterion of myocardial ischemia, such as ECG changes, imaging evidence of new myocardial loss, angiographic documentation of a coronary occlusion, or symptoms consistent with infarction. The distinction can be unclear and coronary angiography can be an invasive diagnostic test [20].The topic is an “elephant in the room” and there are few comprehensive, retrospective, single-centre studies. The results are sometimes heterogeneous with different interpretative biasesIn the study by Toselli et al. (the most recent study included in the meta-analysis), 6505 cardiac surgeries performed between 2016 and 2021 were analysed; they found that 1.83% (119 patients) required urgent coronary angiography during the same hospitalisation. The incidence was higher for post-coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) at 2.62% compared with 1.35% for non-CABG procedures. Graft failure was detected in 31.1% of cases, and native vessel complications in 36.1% [17].The study by Thielmann et al. found that urgent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was associated with lower myocardial injury compared to emergency reperformance of surgery and suggests that the early identification and rapid intervention were crucial for improving survival and preserving myocardial function [9].The study by Litwinowicz et al. analysed 11,537 cardiac surgeries performed over five years, identifying 115 patients (1.19%) who underwent emergency coronary angiography within 24 h post-operation due to hemodynamic instability or suspected myocardial ischemia. Findings from coronary angiography included graft failure (31.3%), native coronary artery occlusion (7.8%), coronary artery embolism (7.0%), coronary artery spasm (4.3%), diffuse atherosclerosis (1.7%), and subclavian artery stenosis (0.9%). No pathological findings were observed in 43.5% of cases. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed in 40% of patients, while 2.6% underwent surgical revascularisation. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 36.5%, with no significant differences between groups, unlike the Toselli and Thielmann studies [15].The study by Davierwala et al. (2013) is the most comprehensive to date, with the longest follow-up, and addresses potential interpretative biases in managing peri-operative myocardial ischemia (PMI). Patients were categorised into four groups based on postoperative angiography and treatment: reperform surgery, PCI, conservative treatment, and normal angiogram. Reperform surgery patients had more frequent multiple graft failures, PCI patients often had incomplete revascularisation, and conservative treatment was reserved for clinically stable or high-risk patients. Those with normal angiograms showed no graft-related issues. Preoperative profiles were generally comparable, aside from higher COPD in the PCI group and greater incidence of diabetes in the conservative group. Minimally invasive surgery was more common in PCI patients, and revascularisation occurred more rapidly with PCI than with reperforming surgery. Reperforming surgery was associated with the highest complication and in-hospital mortality rate (10.8%), while PCI had the lowest mortality among patients with graft failure (5.9%). Although conservative treatment showed reduced 5-year survival compared to normal angiogram patients, in-hospital mortality was similar.In our meta-analysis, we focused specifically on PMI cases severe enough to require invasive coronary angiography after cardiac surgery. The findings reinforce that PMI is not rare, with a 2% prevalence and a 16% mortality rate. To put this into perspective: in a tertiary centre performing 2000 cardiac surgeries per year, that translates to around 40 cases of PMI annually, potentially contributing to a 0.3% post-surgical mortality rate. On a global scale, where 1–2 million cardiac surgeries are performed each year, PMI is far from an insignificant issue (Figure 4).Interestingly, our meta-regression analysis did not reveal any strong study-level predictors of PMI risk or mortality. Patients with hemodynamic instability and a reduced ejection fraction also had a trend toward higher mortality, though no definitive risk profile for PMI could be established. Even clinical signs such as ST elevation, malignant arrhythmias, or documented graft failure did not correlate with significant differences in mortality. A particularly intriguing finding was that patients who presented with arrhythmias and hemodynamic instability were more likely to have a normal coronary angiography, suggesting a complex interplay between ischemia, electrical instability, and hemodynamic stress rather than just anatomical occlusion [21].One of the most striking findings of the study was that 34.3% of patients who underwent coronary angiography showed no significant pathology, raising concerns about the potential overuse of invasive angiography in the postoperative setting.It is important to note that a ‘normal’ coronary angiography in the context of peri-operative myocardial infarction (PMI) after cardiac surgery can be explained by several mechanisms. These include non-atherothrombotic causes of PMI such as oxygen supply–demand imbalance (type 2 MI), transient coronary vasospasm, microembolic events, or myocardial injury related to surgical manipulation or cardiopulmonary bypass. In addition, coronary angiography may fail to detect distal or microvascular obstructions, and the definition of ‘normal’ coronary arteries may include minor, non-critical irregularities. Therefore, a normal angiographic finding does not exclude a peri-operative ischemic event, and this observation highlights the complexity of PMI diagnosis and management in this population.While coronary angiography remains critical, especially given that 23.5% of patients ultimately required PCI—there is an increasing interest in alternative imaging modalities such as coronary CT angiography (CTA). These non-invasive approaches could help refine diagnostic strategies and potentially reduce unnecessary invasive procedures. However, the role of coronary CTA in the postoperative period remains poorly defined, and further research is needed before it can be incorporated into routine clinical practice [22].Another key finding was that conservative treatment was the most commonly used strategy (55.5%) and appeared to be associated with lower mortality compared to PCI and redo surgery. Our network meta-analysis was not conclusive enough to establish definitive superiority, but when ranking treatments in terms of survival, conservative therapy consistently came out on top, followed by PCI, with reperforming surgery associated with the highest mortality risk. These results should not be misinterpreted as a reason to avoid intervention—but rather as a call for a more nuanced, patient-specific approach. Instead of defaulting to PCI or reperforming surgery, a more thoughtful risk–benefit discussion is necessary, particularly when handling high-risk, post-cardiac surgery patients [23].One of the biggest challenges in PMI-rCA management is that it often occurs during off-hours, in the context of urgency/emergency. The decision-making process is further complicated by the need for rapid action in critically ill patients in the absence of strong management evidence. To address this, we have developed a management algorithm for PMI cases requiring coronary angiography, providing a structured approach to decision making. (See proposed algorithm in Figure 7).Clinical decision making in the postoperative setting should begin with a comprehensive clinical interpretation, assessing ischemic symptoms, ECG changes, echocardiographic findings, and biomarkers. A heart team approach is essential, involving interventional cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, intensivists, and clinical cardiologists to guide decisions regarding coronary angiography. In ambiguous cases, coronary CT may be considered when expertise is available to help reduce unnecessary invasive procedures [24]. Before proceeding with angiography, it is crucial to review prior imaging and surgical details, ensuring a thorough understanding of the original surgical strategy. Finally, post-angiography findings should be discussed within the heart team before deciding on PCI or surgery, prioritising optimal patient outcomes rather than solely focusing on treating detected lesions [25].The therapeutic strategy can also be used stepwise with hybrid solutions, such as PCI, to treat the culprit lesion and then the surgical revascularisation can be proposed again at a later time, or repeat CABG/cardiac surgery and the complete revascularisation of a secondary vessel with PCI [26].Another notable point from our analysis was the frequent use of an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) for hemodynamic support. While IABP was historically a mainstay, its use is now declining in favour of more advanced mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices like Impella and ECMO. The fact that our study population had such high IABP usage reflects the limitations of historical data, and future research should explore how modern MCS strategies affect PMI outcomes [27,28]. In this meta-analysis, we identified five key clinical takeaways regarding peri-operative myocardial infarction requiring coronary angiography (PMI-rCA) after cardiac surgery. First, although PMI-rCA is relatively uncommon (2% prevalence), it carries a significant 16% mortality risk, underscoring its clinical relevance. Second, nearly one-third of patients undergoing urgent coronary angiography show no critical lesions, raising concerns about potential overuse of invasive diagnostics. Third, conservative management was associated with the lowest mortality rates, suggesting it should be the preferred initial strategy when clinically appropriate. Fourth, reperforming surgical revascularisation was linked to the highest mortality, supporting a cautious, highly selective use of this intervention. Finally, given the absence of clear predictors and the complex clinical presentations, a multidisciplinary, individualised approach remains essential to optimise decision making and outcomes in this high-risk population.Limitations of the ResearchThis meta-analysis is limited by its reliance on observational studies, which, while providing valuable real-world data, lack the control of randomised trials. Nevertheless, the inclusion of multiple studies strengthens the overall findings.This study is based on observational data, as no randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were available on this topic. PMI itself remains a heterogeneous entity, with definitions still evolving, making standardisation difficult. Additionally, since we specifically analysed PMI cases requiring coronary angiography, there is a deliberate selection bias in this dataset. The time range across the included studies is wide, extending from the study by Thielmann published in 2006 to the most recent by Toselli in 2024; moreover, as all studies were retrospective, temporal variability may have influenced clinical practices and may not fully reflect the contemporary management of peri-operative ischemia.Analysing the available data on mechanical circulatory support in our study, the relatively low use of ECMO and the higher reliance on IABP, compared with more contemporary cohorts, may be attributed to the evolution of clinical practices and the progressive availability of advanced circulatory support technologies over time.The interpretation of our study findings must be contextualised in light of a potential time-related bias, encompassing both historical and technological components; the generalisability of our results is inevitably influenced by these biases.That said, the goal of this study is not to provide absolute answers, but rather to highlight the complexity of PMI and encourage further investigation. Future large-scale registries and multicentre studies will be necessary to provide clearer guidance.The approach must be tailored to the patient, individualised to their coronary anatomy, the territory of ischemia distribution, and surgical/procedural risk. Furthermore, the therapeutic choice must be shared in a multidisciplinary team without therapeutic prevarications. In the case of non-critical ischemia without arrhythmias, and hemodynamic instability, medical therapy will be chosen. In the case of occlusion of a venous graft, it is perhaps better to resort to PCI rather than surgery. The therapeutic choice can also be sequential and resort to surgery in the case of PCI failure. In the case of cardiogenic shock, the choice of PCI/re-surgery will also depend on the hemodynamic support used, in favour of PCI in the case of IABP/Impella and surgery if ECMO is used in patients with arterial graft failure or residual valvular dysfunction.Future research perspectives: Although the present meta-analysis helps to fill an important knowledge gap regarding PMI-rCA, many unresolved issues remain. We consider this study a starting point for future prospective research, and it is our intention that this meta-analysis may at least serve as a reference point for the development of a dedicated registry.5. ConclusionsPMI requiring invasive coronary angiography is not a rare occurrence (2%), and its impact on mortality is significant (16%). Despite analysing multiple variables, no clear study-level predictors emerged that could help better phenotype this complication. However, within the limitations of this meta-analysis, we observed a trend favouring conservative therapy over PCI and reperforming surgery in terms of lower mortality risk. These findings should serve as a starting point for further research, rather than a definitive guideline. Ultimately, PMI-rCA management should be multidisciplinary, with decisions tailored to each patient’s risk profile and clinical presentation. The best approach is likely a combination of optimal medical therapy, advanced imaging, and a thoughtful heart team discussion before proceeding with PCI or surgery. With more research and better-defined protocols, we can move towards minimising the impact of PMI-rCA and improving outcomes for post-cardiac surgery patients."}

In patients with severe ventricular remodeling after TAVR, RAS inhibitors (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers) have been used as an effective treatment to mitigate the adverse effects.3 RAS inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in limiting adverse ventricular remodeling, reducing left ventricular hypertrophy, and preventing myocardial fibrosis.4 Previous analyses on the role of RAS inhibitors after TAVR are mostly based on observational studies, limiting their generalizability. However, the evidence has become more robust with the addition of the recent RASTAVI trial.5 This has allowed a more comprehensive reassessment of the effectiveness of RAS inhibitors after TAVR.The guidelines by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses and Cochrane Handbook were used to report this systematic review and meta-analysis.6,7 A comprehensive and systematic search was formulated and conducted across PubMed, EMBASE, and the COCHRANE Library, with all relevant articles searched from database inception till October 2024 (see Table, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/AJT/A210). We included those studies that compared the use of RAS inhibitors after TAVR with those that did not use RAS inhibitors. We included randomized controlled trials and cohort studies and applied no restrictions on language, follow-up duration, or sample size. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. The secondary outcomes were cardiovascular mortality, heart failure, major bleeding, aortic and mitral regurgitation, acute kidney injury, and stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA). We used the Risk of Bias in Nonrandomized Studies of Interventions tool to appraise the quality of included nonrandomized studies.8 The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool (RoB 2.0) was used to assess the quality of randomized controlled trials.9 Statistical analysis was performed using R Studio's meta and dmetar packages. The dichotomous variables were pooled using odds ratio (OR) and its 95% confidence interval (95% CI) using the random-effects model. Heterogeneity was calculated using Higgins I2 statistic and visualized using a forest plot.10 Leave-one-out sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the effect of each study on I2 and effect size. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were performed to explain heterogeneity across studies. Publication bias was visualized using a funnel plot, and Egger linear regression test was performed for quantitative assessment of outcomes reported by more than 10 studies. A P value of less than 0.05 was considered significant for all analyses.A total of 13 studies5,11–22 were included in our systematic review, and only 1 study, which did not report the required outcomes, was not pooled in our meta-analysis.11 All the studies were cohort studies except one5 randomized controlled trial. A detailed study selection process is summarized in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses flowchart (see Figure, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/AJT/A210). Thirty-six thousand five hundred thirteen patients were pooled in our analysis, from which 17,229 patients were in the RAS inhibitor group, and 19,284 patients were in the control group. Details regarding the baseline characteristics are provided in Table 1. Moderate risk of bias was observed in 5 studies11,16,17,19,20 primarily because of possible selective reporting of results (see Figures 2, 3, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/AJT/A210) The use of RAS inhibitors was significantly associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality (OR 0.67; 95% CI, 0.59–0.77; P < 0.001; I2 = 67%) (Figure 1A) as compared to the control group, which was reported by 11 studies. Leave-one-out sensitivity analysis showed that no study significantly affected the pooled effect size and heterogeneity (see Figure 4, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/AJT/A210) The subgroup analysis was performed based on follow-up duration in years, which was insignificant (P = 0.18) (see Figure 5, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/AJT/A210). Univariate meta-regression analysis of included studies showed that publication year (z = −0.9, P = 0.3), age (z = −0.3, P = 0.74), female sex (z = 0.9, P = 0.3), baseline mean hypertensive patients (z = −0.3, P = 0.8), baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (z = −0.1, P = 0.9), and baseline mean diabetic patients (z = 1.7, P = 0.09) had no moderating effect on all-cause mortality for presence/absence of RAS inhibitors (see Table 2, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/AJT/A210). Visual inspection of the funnel plot showed no visible asymmetry supported by Eggers' linear regression (t = −1.89, P = 0.09) (see Figure 6, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/AJT/A210).Table 1.Characteristics of included studies.Study, yearStudy designSample sizeAge*Female (%)LVEF*DM (%)HTN (%)HF (%)MI (%)Follow-up (year)RASIControlRASIControlAmat-Santos et al5RCT949282.583.358.160.421.2558.0538.77.51Basile et al11C†10510583.5183.4829.5554.130.45—35.7—2Chen et al12C1736224381.782.940.454.736.559383.419.052Cubeddu et al13C3172584079.380.446.85—46.295.1549.2517.13Fischer-Rasokat et al14C†62662682.181.954.3561.3532.6584.2579.110.953Inohara et al15C†7948794882.482.448.0551.9538.793.3579.724.11Kaewkes et al16C34941581.482.941.5592990949.52Klinkhammer et al17C719877.880.141.557.141.586.54601Ledwoch et al18C2259880.779.84552.0522.487.648.113.953Ochiai et al19C37118984.284.872.963.126.0572.650.557.352Phuong et al20C30842777.979.345.555.940.589.6—23.95—Rodriguez-Gabella et al21C†69569580.880.653.7558.334.478.267.3515.651Tomii et al22C163461381.881.950552684.768.313.751*Mean.†Matched.C, cohort; DM, diabetes mellitus; HF, heart failure; HTN, hypertension; MI, myocardial infarction; RASI, renin-angiotensin aystem inhibitor; RCT, randomized controlled trial.FIGURE 1.Forest plots of (A) all-cause mortality and (B) cardiovascular mortality.Cardiovascular mortality was significantly lower in RAS inhibitors (OR 0.64; 95% CI, 0.56–0.74; P < 0.001; I2 = 0) compared to Control (Figure 1B). Risk of heart failure (OR 0.80; 95% CI, 0.62–1.04; P = 0.091), major bleeding (OR 0.88; 95% CI, 0.73–1.07; P = 0.21), aortic regurgitation (OR 1.09; 95% CI, 0.93–1.28; P = 0.27), mitral regurgitation (OR 0.99; 95% CI, 0.88–1.13; P = 0.92), acute kidney injury (OR 0.71; 95% CI, 0.47–1.07; P = 0.104), and stroke/TIA (OR 0.79; 95% CI, 0.49–1.28; P = 0.34) were comparable between the 2 groups (see Figure 7, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/AJT/A210).In this review, the findings provide important evidence for the beneficial effects of RAS inhibitors in improving long-term clinical outcomes after TAVR. An observed reduction in cardiovascular mortality was noted, which can be attributed to the multifaceted cardioprotective mechanism of RAS inhibitors. By blocking the RAS, they can reduce the stress on the heart by lowering the left ventricular afterload, preventing fibrosis, and supporting myocardial remodeling.23 In addition, RAS inhibitors have anti-inflammatory effects that reduce aortic valve inflammation and calcification through pharmacologic inhibition of the angiotensin II pathway. This mechanism counteracts the systemic inflammation caused by TAVR, ultimately leading to improved survival rates and reduced risk of cardiovascular mortality.24 These results align with the results of the Bhat et al meta-analysis, supporting the beneficial role of RAS inhibitors after TAVR.25 A notable dose-dependent relationship between RAS inhibitor use and reduced mortality was reported in 2 studies,14,18 highlighting their critical role in post-TAVR management. These findings underscore the need for future studies on optimizing dosage strategies.Despite a significant increase in survival benefit, no major improvements were found in other clinical outcomes, including heart failure, acute kidney injury, major bleeding, stroke/TIA, and aortic or mitral regurgitation. This discrepancy suggests that the benefits of RAS inhibitors in these clinical outcomes may be influenced by factors such as comorbidities, disease severity, and patient-specific factors. For example, the absence of its effect on bleeding or stroke signifies the selective mechanism of action of RAS inhibitors, which may not extend to these outcomes.Despite the promising findings, some study limitations need to be considered. One major limitation is potential bias because of the predominance of observational studies with only 1 RCT part of the review. Further RCTs are warranted to assess and understand the precise impact of RAS inhibitors after TAVR.In conclusion, this review provides strong evidence supporting the use of RAS inhibitors as a safe and effective strategy to improve clinical outcomes in patients undergoing TAVR. The strength of the study was due to the rigorous methodology and large, pooled sample size. Future studies should focus on dose optimization, timing, patient selection criteria, and combining RAS inhibitors with other treatments to maximize the benefits with limited risks and optimize outcomes in this patient population.Supplementary Material"}

However, there is no evidence‐based evidence that abnormal lncRNA expression is strongly associated with the pathological characteristics and prognosis of EC patients. In this meta‐analysis, we systematically evaluated the relationship between upregulated lncRNA expression levels and clinicopathological features, five‐year survival rate, and progression‐free survival (PFS).MethodsA systematic search was performed across seven reputable databases, namely the China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, Wipu, PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Embase, encompassing the period from the inception of each database until November 27, 2022. Heterogeneity among the studies was assessed through the application of Cochran's Q and I\n2 statistics. All statistical analyses were conducted using Stata 14.0 software.ResultsThis study encompassed 30 clinical studies, involving a total of 2469 EC patients, and examined the expression of 24 lncRNAs, which were upregulated in EC samples. EC patients with higher expression of lncRNAs showed a later FIGO stage (OR = 1.94, 95% CI: 1.29 ~ 2.91), a poorer histological grade (OR = 3.40, 95% CI: 2.51 ~ 4.60), earlier deep myometrial invasion (OR = 2.57, 95% CI: 1.94 ~ 3.41), a higher likelihood of lymphatic vascular space infiltration (OR = 2.86, 95% CI: 1.15 ~ 7.14), an increased propensity for lymph node metastasis (OR = 2.89, 95% CI: 1.82 ~ 4.60), and a greater likelihood of distant metastasis (OR = 2.39, 95% CI: 1.33 ~ 4.30). All of these were statistically significant (p < 0.05). Furthermore, EC patients with a higher expression level of lncRNAs were significantly associated with five‐year survival (p < 0.05) and PFS (p < 0.05).ConclusionsHigh expression levels of upregulated lncRNAs in EC patients are associated with unfavorable clinicopathological features, a poor five‐year survival rate, and PFS. It serves as a detrimental prognostic factor and might be a biomarker and therapeutic target for EC.", "body": "1IntroductionIn recent years, there has been a notable rise in the prevalence of endometrial carcinoma (EC), positioning it as one of the prevailing malignancies within the female reproductive system. This surge in cases may be primarily attributed to the diminishing fertility rates and the escalating rates of obesity [1]. A majority of EC patients are typically diagnosed during the initial stages, and early intervention can significantly enhance the prognosis for these individuals. Nevertheless, a subset of patients continues to experience delayed diagnosis of their condition due to the presence of atypical clinical symptoms, leading to the proliferation of cancer cells within the local area or their dissemination to distant sites. In the context of poor prognosis for advanced‐stage or recurrent EC, there is an urgent need to develop breakthrough therapeutic strategies based on genomics. With the advent of precision oncology, the prognostic information provided by the molecular classification of EC has driven the personalization of clinical management [2]. However, biomarkers have been detected in an endless stream, and there is an increasing emphasis on the integration of molecular signatures in EC [3].Long non‐coding RNA (lncRNA) denotes a subclass of non‐coding RNA molecules surpassing a length of 200 bp. They are characterized by the absence of an open reading coding frame and demonstrate pronounced tissue specificity [4]. LncRNAs are not only crucial in facilitating cell differentiation, apoptosis, and cycle regulation, but they also actively contribute to tumor initiation, progression, invasion, metastasis, and resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs, employing intricate mechanisms. A large number of specific up‐ or down‐regulated lncRNAs were detected in EC. H19 exhibits heightened expression in EC, thereby facilitating the proliferation, invasion, and migration of EC cells [5]. In contrast, the aberrantly reduced expression of Gas5 correlates with tumor staging and unfavorable prognosis in EC [6]. HOTAIR has been found to modulate the cisplatin resistance of EC cells through its impact on the expression of becklin‐1, multidrug resistance, and P‐glycoprotein, as well as its ability to enhance autophagy activity [7]. Therefore, it is difficult for some specific lncRNA to explain the complex molecular mechanism network during the occurrence and development of EC. We need to integrate the regulatory role of lncRNAs in EC through bioinformatics and other methods to better guide clinical diagnosis, treatment, and prognostic value.The association between abnormal lncRNA expression and the prognostic value of EC remains a topic of debate currently. LncRNAs with different characteristics have the same or different prognostic values. A study screened out 13 immune‐related lncRNAs in the TCGA database, which can accurately predict 1‐, 2‐, 3‐, and 5‐year disease‐free survival of EC patients [8]. Based on this feature, the immune status and tumor mutation burden of EC samples can be distinguished [8]. Another study developed a genomic instability‐related lncRNA signature to evaluate the prognosis, influence immune status, and chemotherapeutic drug sensitivity in EC [9]. Six pyroptosis‐related lncRNAs also provided good prediction of EC survival, which was associated with the level of immune infiltration and T cell exhaustion [10]. It can be seen that the majority of studies in this field are characterized by a single‐center nature, small sample sizes, and limited availability of high‐quality evidence‐based medicine. In order to explore the potential of lncRNA as a prognostic biomarker for EC, we undertook a systematic evaluation through meta‐analysis to investigate the association between clinicopathological features and the expression of lncRNA, as well as its prognostic significance.2Materials and Methods2.1Search StrategyWe prospectively registered the systematic review and meta‐analysis with PROSPERO(CRD42023461550). This systematic review and meta‐analysis was conducted in accordance with PRISMA (Pre‐ferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses) guidelines [11].The papers were obtained from widely used literature databases, such as China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang, Wipu, PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Embase, until November 27, 2022. The following search terms were used: “Endometrial Neoplasms or Endometrial Neoplasm or Neoplasm, Endometrial or Neoplasms, Endometrial or Endometrial Carcinoma or Carcinoma, Endometrial or Carcinomas, Endometrial or Endometrial Carcinomas or Endometrial Cancer or Cancer, Endometrial or Cancers, Endometrial or Endometrial Cancers or Endometrium Cancer or Cancer, Endometrium or Cancers, Endometrium or Cancer of the Endometrium or Carcinoma of Endometrium or Endometrium Carcinoma or Endometrium Carcinomas or Cancer of Endometrium or Endometrium Cancers” and “RNA, Long Noncoding or Noncoding RNA, Long or lncRNA or Long ncRNA or ncRNA, Long or RNA, Long Non‐Translated or Long Non‐Translated RNA or Non‐Translated RNA, Long or RNA, Long Non Translated or Long Non‐Coding RNA or Long Non Coding RNA or Non‐Coding RNA, Long or RNA, Long Non‐Coding or Long Non‐Protein‐Coding RNA or Long Non Protein Coding RNA or Non‐Protein‐Coding RNA, Long or RNA, Long Non‐Protein‐Coding or Long Noncoding RNA or RNA, Long Untranslated or Long Untranslated RNA or Untranslated RNA, Long or Long ncRNAs or ncRNAs, Long or Long Intergenic Non‐Protein Coding RNA or Long Intergenic Non Protein Coding RNA or LincRNA or LINC RNA or LincRNAs”. To ensure comprehensive coverage, relevant references in the literature were manually searched to minimize the risk of overlooking any relevant studies. The document type was restricted to English and Chinese.2.2Selection CriteriaThe inclusion criteria were as follows: (1)This study aims to investigate the association between elevated expression of lncRNAs and clinicopathological characteristics as well as the prognosis of EC through a cohort design; (2) Patients diagnosed with EC were excluded if they had received preoperative radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or endocrine therapy; (3) The participants were categorized into high and low expression groups based on the levels of lncRNAs; (4) Outcome indicators encompass various clinical features such as age, FIGO stage, histological grade, myometrial invasion, lymphatic vascular space invasion, lymph node metastasis, and distant metastasis. Additionally, prognosis is evaluated through parameters such as the five‐year survival rate, progression‐free survival (PFS), hazard risk ratio (HR) or odds ratio (OR), and their corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI); (5) The literature included in this study comprises publications in both Chinese and English languages.The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) A study involving experimentation on cells or animals; (2) Correspondence in the form of letters, case reports, reviews, meeting minutes, and comments; (3) The necessary data could not be extracted from the original article due to the unavailability of the full text or duplication of publication; (4) A study that reported the presence of multiple lncRNAs; (5) Investigation focused on reprocessing data obtained from publicly accessible databases, such as the GEO database and TCGA database; (6) In the case of multiple publications reporting the same subset of data, only the most recent publications are considered.2.3Data Extraction and Quality AssessmentThe process of data extraction was conducted by two researchers in an independent manner, with any disagreements being resolved by a third researcher. The extracted information encompasses various aspects, including the first author, year of publication, country of origin, specimen type, type of lncRNAs, method of detection, sample size (categorized as high or low), cutoff value for lncRNAs expression, indices related to outcomes (such as age, FIGO stage, histological grade, myometrial invasion, lymphatic vascular space invasion, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, five‐year survival rate, and PFS), follow‐up duration, and survival analysis. The HR and its corresponding 95% CI of the five‐year survival rate or PFS period can be obtained by directly extracting the relevant data from the survival data presented in this paper. Alternatively, they can be indirectly calculated from the survival curve using Engauge Digitizer software. The quality of the literature included in the study was assessed using the Newcastle‐Ottawa scale (NOS). A NOS score of ≥ 6 indicates a high‐quality study.2.4Statistical AnalysisThe Stata14.0 software was utilized to conduct a quantitative synthesis and comprehensive analysis of Meta. The clinicopathological features were examined using the OR value and corresponding 95% CI, while the impact of lncRNA on the prognosis of patients with EC was assessed by combining HR and 95% CI. The evaluation criteria consisted of the five‐year survival rate and PFS. The heterogeneity of the included studies was evaluated through the utilization of the Q test and I2 test. When the heterogeneity of each study is small (I\n2 < 50%; p > 0.05), the fixed effect model is employed for Meta‐analysis. Conversely, if there is substantial heterogeneity (I\n2 > 50%; p ≤ 0.05), the random effect model is utilized for meta‐analysis. In the event of significant heterogeneity, sensitivity analysis is employed to assess the stability of the merged results. Additionally, subgroup analysis can be employed to investigate the impact of heterogeneity sources and grouping factors on the outcomes. The funnel plot and Egger test were employed to assess publication bias.3Results3.1Study SelectionAs shown in Figure 1, a total of 1400 papers were obtained from 7 databases. Out of these, 754 papers were eliminated due to duplication, employing both automated and manual methods. Additionally, 583 papers were excluded based on a preliminary assessment of their titles or abstracts. The complete texts of the remaining 63 papers were meticulously examined, resulting in the exclusion of 33 studies due to insufficient expression of lncRNAs or inadequate data. Ultimately, a final selection of 30 clinical cohort studies was included in the systematic review and meta‐analysis (Figure 1) [6, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40].FIGURE 1The flowchart of the selection.3.2Characteristics of Included StudiesWe conducted a comprehensive review of 30 studies [6, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40] presented in Table 1, comprising 13 Chinese papers and 17 English papers. These studies encompassed 24 distinct lncRNAs, namely ZNFX1‐AS1, ZFASI, UCA1, SNHG1, PCAT1, NNT‐AS1, NEAT1, MCM3AP‐AS1, MALAT1, LINPI, LINC00958, LINC00565, LINC00393, HOTAIR, H19, DLEU1, DCST1‐AS1, CASC9, CARLo‐5, BANCR, AFAP1‐AS1, AFAP1‐AS, LINC01123, and HOXB‐AS1. The collective sample size across these studies amounted to 2469 patients diagnosed with EC, spanning the period from 2013 to 2022. With the exception of one study, the samples originated from Poland, while the remaining studies were conducted in China. One sample was derived from serum, while the remaining samples were obtained from tissue. There is no universally accepted criterion for determining the diagnostic expression level cutoff currently. These lncRNAs, which showed an up‐regulated trend in EC, were divided into high and low expression groups. A total of 21 studies furnished data on clinicopathological features, while 17 studies examined the correlation between lncRNA and five‐year survival. Additionally, 2 studies evaluated the association between lncRNA and PFS. All studies obtained a minimum Newcastle‐Ottawa Scale (NOS) score of six, as indicated in Table 2.TABLE 1Characteristics of studies included in this meta‐analysis.Author (particular year)CountrySpecimen typeLncRNAs typologyInspection methodsSample size (max/min)Truncation valueOutcome indicatorOutcome indicatorFollow‐up time (months)He (2013) [6]ChinaOrganizationHOTAIRISH63/24NA①②③④⑤⑥NANAHuang (2014) [12]ChinaOrganizationHOTAIRqRT‐PCR61/202.6①②③④⑤⑥NANAHan (2016) [14]ChinaOrganizationMALAT1qRT‐PCR104Average value⑨Univariate analysis48Zhao XW (2016) [15]ChinaOrganizationCARLo‐5qRT‐PCR54/54Upper quartile①②③④⑤⑥NANALu (2016) [16]ChinaOrganizationUCA1qRT‐PCR12/33Upper quartile①②⑥⑦⑧Univariate analysis60Wang D (2016) [17]ChinaOrganizationBANCRqRT‐PCR15/15Upper quartile②④⑥NANAŁuczak (2016) [18]PolandOrganizationHOTAIRqRT‐PCR56/100Upper quartile②NANAShen (2017) [19]ChinaOrganizationNEAT1ISH19/39Upper quartile①②③⑥⑦⑧Univariate analysis60Guan (2019) [20]ChinaOrganizationCARLo⁃5qRT‐PCR79NA⑧Multivariate statistics60Yang L (2019) [21]ChinaOrganizationAFAP1‐AS1qRT‐PCR64/56Average value③④⑥⑧Multivariate statistics60Wu (2019) [22]ChinaOrganizationH19qRT‐PCR56/34NA①②③④⑥NANAMai (2019) [23]ChinaOrganizationLINC00393qRT‐PCR117/33NA②⑥NANAZhao XH (2019) [25]ChinaOrganizationPCAT1qRT‐PCR50/39Upper quartile①②④⑤⑥⑧Multivariate statistics60Wang F (2020) [24]ChinaOrganizationZFASIqRT‐PCR45/311.72⑧Multivariate statistics60Wang S (2020) [26]ChinaOrganizationAFAP1‐ASqRT‐PCR62/50Average value②③④⑥⑧Multivariate statisticsShan (2020) [27]ChinaPlasmaDLEU1qRT‐PCR128Upper quartile⑧Multivariate statistics60Yang YG (2020) [28]ChinaOrganizationLINC01123qRT‐PCR52/54Upper quartile②③④⑥⑧Multivariate statistics60Sun (2021) [29]ChinaOrganizationZNFX1‐AS1qRT‐PCR41/23Upper quartile①②④⑥⑧Multivariate statistics60Yin (2020) [30]ChinaOrganizationLINC00565qRT‐PCR26/26Upper quartile⑥⑦NANAKe (2020) [31]ChinaOrganizationDCST1‐AS1qRT‐PCR31/31Upper quartile⑧Univariate analysis60Wang GF (2020) [32]ChinaOrganizationSNHG1qRT‐PCR26/26NA⑥⑦NANAGuo (2021) [39]ChinaOrganizationLINPIqRT‐PCR41/41Upper quartile③⑤⑥NANALi (2021) [33]ChinaOrganizationLINC00958qRT‐PCR50/50NA⑧Univariate analysis60Yu (2021) [34]ChinaOrganizationMCM3AP‐AS1qRT‐PCR30/30Upper quartile⑥⑧⑨Univariate analysis60Ma (2021) [36]ChinaOrganizationNNT‐AS1qRT‐PCR24/341.7⑧Multivariate statistics60Wang TT (2021) [37]ChinaOrganizationCASC9qRT‐PCR46/341.42⑧Multivariate statistics60Gong (2022) [35]ChinaOrganizationAFAP1‐ASqRT‐PCR62/50Average value②③④⑥⑧Multivariate statistics60Liu D (2020) [40]ChinaOrganizationHOXB‐AS1qRT‐PCR32/32NA②⑥NANALuo (2022) [13]ChinaOrganizationNEAT1qRT‐PCR18/18Upper quartile①②③④⑤⑥NANALiu YJ (2022) [38]ChinaOrganizationSNHG1qRT‐PCR27/271.61⑧Univariate analysis60\nNote: ① Age; ② FIGO stage; ③ Histological grade; ④ Myometrial invasion; ⑤ Lymphovascular space invasion; ⑥ Lymph node metastasis; ⑦ Distant metastasis; ⑧ Five‐year survival rate; ⑨ progression‐free survival.Abbreviations: ISH, in situ hybridization; qRT‐PCR: quantitative reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction.TABLE 2Quality assessment of the individual study.Study cohortCohort selection criteriaComparabilityStudy assessmentScoreRepresentativeness of exposed cohortSelection of nonexposed cohortAscertainment of exposureOutcome not present at the startAssessment of outcomeFollow‐up lengthFollow‐up adequacyGong (2022) [35]********—8Guan (2019) [20]********8Guo (2021) [39]*******—*8Han (2016) [14]******——6Luo (2022) [13]********8Ma (2021) [36]*********9Mai (2019) [23]******——6Wang S (2020) [26]********—8Wu (2019) [22]********—8Liu YJ (2022) [38]*********9Wang F (2020) [24]*********9Wang TT (2021) [37]*********9Yang L (2019) [21]*********9Lu (2016) [16]****—***7Shan (2020) [27]********—8Shen (2017) [19]****—***7Wang D (2016) [17]*******——7Yin (2020) [30]*******—7Zhao XH (2019) [25]********—8Zhao XW (2016) [15]*******—7Li (2021) [33]********8Yu (2021) [34]********8He (2013) [6]******——6Huang (2014) [12]******——6Ke (2020) [31]********8Liu D (2020) [40]******——6Łuczak (2016) [18]*******—7Sun (2021) [29]********8Wang GF (2020) [32]*******—7Yang YG (2020) [28]*******—7\nNote: For comparability, two asterisks are obtained if the multivariate analysis is used to correct age‐mixed factors.

This analysis included data from 1754 patients, and the appropriate effect model was selected based on I\n2 and p values (Table 3). EC patients with higher expression of lncRNAs showed a later FIGO stage (OR = 1.94, 95% CI: 1.29 ~ 2.91) (Figure 2A), a poorer histological grade (OR = 3.40, 95% CI: 2.51 ~ 4.60) (Figure 2B), earlier deep myometrial invasion (OR = 2.57, 95% CI: 1.94 ~ 3.41) (Figure 2C), a higher likelihood of lymphatic vascular space infiltration (OR = 2.86, 95% CI: 1.15 ~ 7.14) (Figure 2D), an increased propensity for lymph node metastasis (OR = 2.89, 95% CI: 1.82 ~ 4.60) (Figure 2E), and a greater likelihood of distant metastasis (OR = 2.39, 95% CI: 1.33 ~ 4.30) (Figure 2F). The observed differences were found to be statistically significant (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in age between the high and low lncRNA expression groups (p = 0.746 > 0.05) (Figure 3).TABLE 3Summary of high lncRNAs expressed related to clinicopathological features of EC.Clinicopathological featureNo. of studiesNo. of patientsMeta analysisHeterogeneityEffect modelOR (95% CI)\np\n\nI\n2 (%)\np\nAge (≥ 55/< 55)96521.06 (0.76, 1.46)0.7460.00%0.512FixedFIGO stage (III + IV/I + II)1613851.94 (1.29, 2.91)0.00251.90%0.008RandomHistological grade (G3/G1 + G2)1110573.40 (2.51, 4.60)034.10%0.126FixedMyometrial invasion (≥ 1/2/< 1/2)1210352.57 (1.94, 3.41)00.00%0.461FixedLymphovascular space invasion (YES/NO)64832.86 (1.15, 7.14)0.02463.00%0.019RandomLymph node metastasis (YES/NO)2015982.89 (1.82, 4.60)067.60%0RandomDistant metastasis (YES/NO)42072.39 (1.33, 4.30)0.00439.50%0.175FixedFIGURE 2Forest plot for the association between the high expression of lncRNAs and clinical features.

The heterogeneity analysis revealed a low level of heterogeneity among the studies (I\n2, 35.2%, p = 0.076 > 0.05), leading to the adoption of a fixed effect model. There was a significant correlation between high expression levels of lncRNAs and the five‐year survival rate (HR = 2.71, 95% CI: 2.48–2.97) (p = 0.000 < 0.05) (Figure 4). Based on various survival analysis methods (univariate analysis or multivariate analysis), the examination of sample size (sample size ≥ 100 or < 100), and the determination of the cutoff value for lncRNA expression level (median, mean or NA), the findings indicate a significant disparity between high expression of lncRNAs and the five‐year survival rate. The potential sources of heterogeneity include multi‐factor analysis (I\n2 = 54.8%, p = 0.015), sample size < 100 (I\n2 = 58.2%, p = 0.08), and NA (I\n2 = 59.1%, p = 0.032) in relation to the cutoff value (Table 4).FIGURE 4Forest plot for the association between high lncRNAs expression and five‐year survival rate.TABLE 4Subgroup analysis of high lncRNA expression and five‐year survival rate in EC.SubgroupNumber of studies (n)Number of sample (n)Meta analyze heterogeneityHR (95% CI)\np\n\nI\n2\n\np\nSurvival analysisMultivariate1110242.63 (2.21, 3.13)0.00054.8%0.015Univariate63792.24 (1.50, 3.35)0.0000.0%0.893Sample size≥ 10066782.72 (2.19, 3.37)0.0000.0%0.979< 100117252.71 (2.45, 2.99)0.00058.2%0.008Truncation valueUpper quartile86122.50 (1.95, 3.21)0.00031.6%0.176Average value33442.69 (2.09, 3.45)0.0000.0%0.775NA64472.62 (1.90, 3.62)0.00059.1%0.032Abbreviation: NA, not mentioned.The relationship between high expression of lncRNAs and PFS in patients with EC was investigated in two studies. Heterogeneity analysis revealed no significant heterogeneity among the studies (I\n2 = 0.0%, p = 0.712 > 0.05), the fixed effect model was employed. The findings from the Meta‐analysis indicate that patients with high expression of lncRNAs had a significantly shorter PFS compared to those with low expression (HR = 2.39, 95% CI: 1.45–3.92) (Figure 5). This difference was statistically significant, as evidenced by (z = 3.428, p = 0.001).FIGURE 5Sensitivity analysis of five‐year survival rate.3.5Sensitivity AnalysisIn order to assess the influence of individual studies on the overall hazard ratio (HR), a sensitivity analysis was conducted by excluding each study from the aggregate analysis. The results indicate that the overall HR remains stable, suggesting that the meta‐analysis results are robust (Figure 6).FIGURE 6Forest plot for the association between high lncRNAs expression and PFS.3.6Publication BiasThe published offset assessment was conducted by employing the funnel chart to qualitatively assess the publication offset of the Meta‐analysis. The analysis of the funnel chart distribution of the five‐year survival rate exhibited symmetrical patterns on both the left and right sides (Figure 7A). In addition, the Egger test showed that there was no substantial evidence to support the existence of publication bias (p > 0.420) (Figure 7B).FIGURE 7Publication bias. (A) Funnel plot analysis. (B) Begg's funnel plot.4DiscussionDue to the unfavorable prognosis linked to advanced and metastatic EC, it has become crucial to explore tumor markers that can facilitate early detection and intervention. Extensive investigation has revealed the important role of lncRNAs in regulating EC development, progression and prognosis [5, 6, 7, 22, 25, 41]. However, there is no consensus on the prognostic significance of aberrant expression of different types of lncRNAs in EC. Moreover, the regulatory mechanism of a large number of lncRNAs involved in the occurrence, development, and prognosis of EC cannot be explained by one of them. With the advancements in high‐throughput sequencing technology and the emergence of targeted therapy in recent years, research on aberrant lncRNA expression has become more diverse and precise. In the past 5 years, no studies have explored the relationship between elevated lncRNA expression and clinicopathological features and prognosis in EC patients. A previous study focused only on overall survival time and did not explore the association between high lncRNA expression and other survival outcomes [42]. Therefore, in order to conduct a wider range of investigation, our meta‐analysis incorporates a substantial quantity of high‐quality studies and employs a broader range of outcome indicators to enhance the dependability of the findings.Age, FIGO stage, myometrial invasion, histological grade, lymphatic vascular space invasion, lymph node metastasis, and distant metastasis serve as crucial benchmarks for assessing patient prognosis. So we incorporated these projects as discernible indicators of clinicopathologic characteristics in order to evaluate the association between elevated expression of lncRNAs and the prognosis of EC. The results showed that worse clinicopathologic features in EC patients, except for age, were associated with higher levels of upregulated lncRNAs expression. In addition, we used five‐year survival and PFS as prognostic survival indicators compared to previous studies. In EC patients, upregulated lncRNAs expression was higher, with lower five‐year survival rates and PFS. Consequently, elevated expression levels of upregulated lncRNAs may serve as an indicator of survival rate and poor overall prognosis in EC patients.The results imply that for EC patients with upregulated lncRNAs expression, molecular targeted inhibition of lncRNAs can be achieved to reduce the pathological grade, alleviate drug resistance, and prolong the prognosis. The lncRNAs, like H19, NEAT1, and ZEB1‐AS1, included in our study have been shown to be involved in various signaling pathways related to EC. The increased expression of H19 has been shown to enhance the mobility and invasiveness of EC cells by modulating metastatic genes (Hmga2, c‐Myc, and Imp3) through let‐7‐mediated mechanisms [43]. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in the role of exosome‐associated lncRNAs in cancer diagnosis and treatment. The exocrine NEAT1, originating from cancer‐associated fibroblasts, can be transferred to EC cells. Then, NEAT1 played a role in promoting the carcinogenicity of EC by modulating the miR‐26a/b‐5p‐STAT3‐YKL‐40 axis [44]. In terms of EC cells chemodrug resistance, one study showed that the upregulation of ZEB1‐AS1 promoted the proliferation and lymph node metastasis of EC cells while reducing sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents such as 5‐fluorouracil and cisplatin [45].The above articles reflect a strong correlation between high expression levels of upregulated lncRNA and the development, progression, and poor prognosis of EC, which is consistent with the conclusions of this study. At the same time, it also enlightens us to think about how to apply the controllability of lncRNAs to the clinical diagnosis and treatment of EC patients. Due to the predictability of the lncRNA model on the immune microenvironment of EC patients, it holds great promise in immunotherapy [8, 9, 10]. In addition, lncRNAs can achieve signal transduction between tumor cells through exosomes, and engineering exosomes carrying lncRNAs can achieve precise regulation that reduces cytotoxicity and significantly inhibits tumor growth [46, 47]. It really helps us develop drugs that specifically target these lncRNAs and inhibit their role in tumor progression. On the other hand, we can incorporate the identified lncRNAs associated with poor prognosis into diagnostic protocols for endometrial cancer, allowing clinicians to better stratify patients according to their risk profile and thus develop more precise and personalized treatment strategies. Additionally, we can include patients with high expression of these lncRNAs in a more rigorous follow‐up program, improving the efficiency of early detection and intervention in the disease and thus improving overall survival.Although our meta‐analysis included as many high‐quality studies as possible, there were some limitations. Since the majority of participants were of Chinese descent and the samples relied on pathological tissue specimens, this limited the generality of the findings and conclusions to a certain extent. Furthermore, some of the studies included in this analysis did not explicitly provide the necessary prognostic indicator data, so the above information needed to be manually extracted from the Kaplan–Meier survival curve. In the future, there is a need to expand the sample size as much as possible and update the content by supplementing multi‐region and multi‐species lncRNA studies.In summary, our study synthesized multiple small samples into a large sample for statistical analysis, first showing that the high expression of lncRNAs is significantly associated with poor clinicopathological characteristics and unfavorable prognosis (five‐year survival rate and PFS) in EC patients. The reliability of lncRNAs as potential prognostic biomarkers is greatly enhanced. Our study provides evidence to support the future application of lncRNAs in the diagnosis, monitoring, and follow‐up strategies of EC patients, as well as the development of targeted therapies.Author Contributions\nXiaotong Zhao: conceptualization (lead), data curation (lead), formal analysis (lead), writing – original draft (equal).

{"PMCID": "12226365", "title": "Effect of Frailty on Cardiovascular Clinical Trials", "abstract": "BackgroundPatients with cardiovascular (CV) diseases are increasingly frail but rarely represented in trials. Understanding effect modification by frailty on CV trials is critical as it could help define treatment strategies in frail patients.ObjectivesThis meta-analysis aims to assess the implications of frailty on CV outcomes in clinical trials.MethodsRandomized controlled trials examining the effects of frailty in the context of CV trials were included (CRD42024528279). Outcomes included a composite of major adverse cardiac events (MACE), all-cause mortality, CV mortality, hospitalizations, and frailty-specific outcomes (physical, quality of life, and frailty scores). HRs and 95% CIs were pooled for clinical endpoints, and standardized mean differences (SMDs) were calculated for frailty-specific outcomes.ResultsThirty unique randomized controlled trials were included with a pooled total of 87,711 participants. Frail patients had a significantly increased risk of MACE (HR: 2.33 [95% CI: 1.87-2.91], P < 0.001, I2 = 83%), all-cause mortality (HR: 2.34 [95% CI: 1.80-3.05], P < 0.01, I2 = 75%), CV mortality (HR: 1.76 [95% CI: 1.60-1.93], P < 0.001, I2 = 0%), and hospitalizations (HR: 2.38 [95% CI: 1.65-3.43], P < 0.001, I2 = 92%) compared to nonfrail patients. In the frailest group, trial interventions decreased MACE (HR: 0.81 [95% CI: 0.74-0.88], P < 0.001, I2 = 0%) and hospitalization (HR: 0.81 [95% CI: 0.72-0.90], P < 0.001, I2 = 0%) risks with no significant difference in mortality risk (P > 0.05) compared with the control group. Trial interventions significantly improved physical (SMD: 0.15, 0.04-0.26) and quality of life (SMD: 0.15, 0.09-0.21) but not frailty scores (P > 0.05).ConclusionsWhile frailty prognosticated a higher risk of CV events and mortality, frailty did not reduce treatment efficacy. CV trial interventions appear beneficial even in the frailest group.", "body": "Frailty is a syndrome of increased vulnerability resulting from age-related decrease in physiological reserve such that the body's ability to deal with acute stress is compromised1 and can be defined by frailty indices.2 It is associated with a significantly increased risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE), hospitalization, and other adverse outcomes in cardiovascular disease (CVD).3 As both frailty and CVD are linked to age, up to 62% of patients with frailty have CVD.4Traditionally, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have excluded patients beyond a certain age and, by extension, a significant proportion of the frail population.5, 6, 7, 8 Even when RCTs include the oldest old, there is often a lack of data granularity on the frailty status of trial participants.9 This makes it difficult to apply findings of RCTs to frail patients, who are at high risk of adverse cardiovascular (CV) outcomes and have potential to benefit from intervention.10 There may be a misperception among physicians about reduced treatment efficacy in frail patients given its associations with poor outcomes,11 which is not supported by available RCTs.In the past decade, an increasing number of trials have included older patients >80 years of age to ensure commensurate representation of this important subgroup.9,12 However, the use of frailty assessment tools in trials has been unstandardized and remains underutilized.12,13 Even if frailty assessment had been reported in RCTs, it is often as part of a post hoc analysis rather than as a predefined outcome.14In this study, we aim to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis investigating the effect of frailty as a risk and effect modifier on outcomes and interventions, respectively, in RCTs on CV interventions.MethodsSearch strategy and selection criteriaThree investigators (H.J., J.J.W., and A.S.K.) performed a literature search of PubMed and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) databases for articles on RCTs published between January 1, 2014, and March 30, 2024, in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses recommendations.15 Database-specific search terms are detailed in Supplemental Table 1. Articles that involved nonhuman subjects or were written in non-English language or without full text available were excluded. Letters that reported RCTs were included if there was sufficient detail on the methodology and results. In addition, relevant citations in the articles were also identified and reviewed for inclusion in the analysis. This review has been registered at PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews) (CRD42024528279). Ethics review was not required for this study.Data collection and assessment of qualityDouble literature searching was conducted during the literature searching phase by 2 investigators (H.J. and J.J.W.), and results were verified, and discrepancies (if any) were evaluated by a third investigator (A.S.K.). Once all papers were identified for both topics, study characteristics such as name of the first author, country of study conduction, numbers of participants, mean age, race/ethnicity, years of follow-up, frailty definitions, assessment of CVD outcomes, effect size, and adjustments model were tabulated.Two investigators (H.J. and J.J.W.) performed the quality assessments for all papers based on the Cochrane risk of bias assessment, and a third investigator (A.S.K.) assessed the findings independently.Data synthesis and analysisData analysis was conducted by H.J. and G.F. When different measurement tools were used, adjusted standardized mean differences (SMDs) were calculated by dividing SMD by the average baseline scores. The adjusted SMDs were then pooled together for analysis using a random effects model. For clinical outcomes, HRs and their 95% CI were pooled together using a random effects model. The main clinical outcomes of interest are 1) composite of MACE as defined by each trial; 2) all-cause mortality; 3) CV mortality; and 4) all-cause hospitalizations. In cases where all-cause hospitalization was not available, heart failure or CV hospitalizations were used as a surrogate. In studies where frailty status was subdivided into 3 or more groups, the group with the least frailty score was classified as “not frail” and the group with the highest frailty score was classified as “frail.” All groups in between were classified as “prefrail.” Subgroup analysis of pharmacological, procedural, or rehabilitative interventions was also performed.Statistical heterogeneity was assessed with the Cochrane Q-test16 and I2 statistic, defining levels as mild, moderate, substantial, and considerable heterogeneity based on I2 values falling within the ranges of 0% to 40%, 30% to 60%, 50% to 90%, and 75% to 100%, respectively.17 Publication bias was assessed visually with funnel plots and with the Egger (linear regression method) test,18 and a P value <0.05 was considered representative of statistically significant publication bias. All analyses were conducted with RStudio (version 4.3.1). All P values were from 2-sided tests, and the results were deemed statistically significant at P < 0.05 unless stated otherwise.ResultsBaseline characteristicsOf 335 studies screened, 30 unique RCTs with a pooled total of 87,711 participants were included in the analysis.

This table demonstrates the large variability in the frailty classification used across trials.ADHF = acute decompensated heart failure; CABG = coronary artery bypass graft; CR = cardiac rehabilitation; DAOH = days alive and out of hospital; EMS = electrical muscle stimulation; ET = exercise therapy; FI = frailty index; GDMT = guideline-directed medical therapy; HBCR = home-based cardiac rehabilitation; HFpEF = heart failure with preserved ejection fraction; HFrEF = heart failure with reduced ejection fraction; ICT = information and communication technology; IHD = ischemic heart disease; MI = myocardial infarction; NOAC = novel oral anticoagulant; NSTEMI = non-ST elevation myocardial infarction; SAVR = surgical aortic valve replacement; TAVR = transcatheter aortic valve replacement; VKA = vitamin K antagonist.The 30 RCTs encompassed diverse prespecified CVDs, including heart failure,24, 25, 26, 27, 28,31,32,35, 36, 37,42,43,45 ischemic heart disease (IHD)/acute coronary syndromes,11,14,22,29,33,46 valvular heart diseases,30,38,41 atrial fibrillation,34,40,47 and other acute CV conditions.19,20 The trials also included a wide range of interventions, including pharmacological11,14,31,33, 34, 35,37,39,40,42, 43, 44, 45,47 (n = 15, 50.0%), rehabilitative19,20,22, 23, 24, 25,27, 28, 29, 30,32,36 (n = 10, 33.3%), procedural21,38,41,46 (n = 4, 13.3%), and nutritional26 (n = 1, 3.3%) interventions. The follow-up periods ranged from 1 to 60 months across trials, with a median of 12 months. Most RCTs were classified as having low risk of bias;11,14,19, 20, 21,24,26,27,31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45,47 and a small proportion had medium risk of bias.22,23,25,29,30,46 (Supplemental Figure 2).Effect of frailty on clinical endpointsEleven RCTs reported clinical outcomes in frail and prefrail patients compared to nonfrail patients.11,31,33,34,36, 37, 38,41,45 Of these 11 RCTs, 6 included patients with heart failure,31,36,37,43,45 2 included patients with IHD,11,33 2 included patients with aortic stenosis,38,41 and 1 included patients with atrial fibrillation.34 All trials included were judged to be at low risk of bias.Frail and prefrail patients involved in CV trials have an increased risk of MACE (frail: HR: 2.33, 95% CI: 1.87-2.91, P < 0.001; prefrail: HR: 1.56, 95% CI: 1.30-1.88, P < 0.001), all-cause mortality (frail: HR: 2.34, 95% CI: 1.80-3.05, P < 0.001; prefrail: HR: 1.57, 95% CI: 1.23-2.01, P < 0.001), CV mortality (frail: HR: 1.76, 95% CI: 1.60-1.93, P < 0.001; prefrail: HR: 1.28, 95% CI: 1.18-1.39, P < 0.001), and hospitalizations (frail: HR: 2.38, 95% CI: 1.65-3.43, P < 0.001; prefrail: HR: 1.48, 95% CI: 1.21-1.82, P < 0.001). The magnitude of the effect size was numerically larger in frail than prefrail patients across all clinical outcomes (Figure 1).Figure 1Overview of Clinical Outcomes in Frail and Prefrail PatientsComparison of rates of MACE, all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and hospitalizations between (A) frail and (B) prefrail with nonfrail patients. CV = cardiovascular; MACE = major adverse cardiac events.Effect of treatment interventions stratified by frailty statusNine RCTs examined the impact of various interventions on MACE across frailty subgroups: 4 RCTs on heart failure;28,32,35,42 2, IHD;14,46 2, hypertension;39,44 and 1, atrial fibrillation.40 All trials included were judged to be at low risk of bias except for 1 trial.46Compared with standard care (control), intervention resulted in significant reductions in MACE in patients who were frail (HR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.74-0.88, P < 0.001) and nonfrail (HR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.72-0.97, P = 0.02), but not in patients who were prefrail (HR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.69-1.01, P = 0.06). There was no significant interaction between frailty status and MACE outcomes (P = 0.90) (Figure 2).Figure 2Major Adverse Cardiac Events Stratified by Frailty StatusHRs for major adverse cardiac events for trial interventions compared to controlled group, stratified by frailty status.Across all 3 frailty categories, there were no significant differences in rates of all-cause mortality (nonfrail: HR: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.73-1.07, P = 0.11; pefrail: HR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.78-1.02, P = 0.11; frail: HR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.79-1.02, P = 0.11) or CV mortality (nonfrail: HR: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.46-1.14, P = 0.17; prefrail: HR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.71-1.04, P = 0.12; frail: HR: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.82-1.10, P = 0.49) between the intervention and control groups. There was no significant interaction between frailty status with all-cause mortality (P = 0.99) or CV mortality outcomes (P = 0.44) (Figures 3 and 4).Figure 3All-Cause Mortality Outcomes Stratified by Frailty StatusHRs for all-cause mortality for trial interventions compared to the controlled group, stratified by frailty status.Figure 4Cardiovascular Mortality Outcomes Stratified by Frailty StatusHRs for cardiovascular mortality for interventions compared to the controlled group, stratified by frailty status.Four RCTs, all involving patients with heart failure, examined the effects on hospitalization outcomes across frailty status;27,32,35,42 RCTs examining other CV conditions did not report hospitalization as an outcome. Two trials examined the use of pharmacological interventions,35,42 and 2 trials examined rehabilitative interventions.27,32 With intervention, there were no significant differences in the rates of hospitalizations in the nonfrail group (HR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.72-1.18, P = 0.53) or prefrail group (HR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.81-1.06, P = 0.25), but there was significantly reduced rate of hospitalizations in the frail group (HR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.72-0.90, P < 0.001). There was no significant interaction between frailty status with hospitalization outcomes (P = 0.25) (Figure 5).Figure 5Hospitalization Outcomes Stratified by Frailty StatusHRs for hospitalizations for interventions compared to the controlled group, stratified by frailty status.Subgroup analysis including only RCTs examining pharmacological interventions showed similar outcomes for MACE, all-cause mortality, CV mortality, and hospitalizations (Supplemental Figures 3 to 7). The limited number of studies with rehabilitative and procedural interventions precluded separate analysis.Effect of trial interventions on quality of life, physical function, and frailty scoresTen RCTs—5 on acute or chronic heart failure;21,24, 25, 26, 27 3 on IHD or acute coronary syndrome22,23,29; 1 on valvular heart diseases30; and 1 on acute CV conditions19,20—reported on the effect of trial interventions on physical scores, quality of life, and frailty scores. Eight RCTs focused on rehabilitation exercises;19,20,22, 23, 24, 25,27,29,30 1 on nutritional support;26 and 1 on electrical muscle stimulation.21 The trials varied widely in the reporting of outcomes, which necessitated the conversion of outcomes to a standardized format as described in the methods. Eight trials reported on changes in physical scores;19,21, 22, 23, 24, 25,27,30 5 on Short Physical Performance Battery score; 2 on gait speed; and 1 on six-minute walk distance. Among the 10 trials, 4 were judged to be at moderate risk of bias.21,22,29,30Pooling together changes in physical scores, frailty-specific cardiac rehabilitation programs significantly improved physical scores (SMD: 0.15, 95% CI: 0.04-0.26, P = 0.001). However, the degree of heterogeneity was large (I2 = 76%, P < 0.001), likely attributed to the wide range of physical scores used across trials. Three RCTs reported on changes in quality of life, all assessed using the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire.20,26,27 There was a significant increase in quality of life reported by patients who underwent frailty-specific rehabilitation compared to usual care (SMD: 0.15, 95% CI: 0.09-0.21, P = 0.001), which is consistent across studies with minimal heterogeneity (I2 = 0%, P = 0.97). Four RCTs (all rehabilitation-based trials) reported changes in frailty scores using different measures of frailty.22,25,27,30 After adjustment and pooling of outcomes, there was a nonsignificant trend toward improvement in frailty scores (SMD: 0.09, 95% CI: −0.04 to 0.22, P = 0.27) (Figure 6).Figure 6Frailty-Specific OutcomesEffect of rehabilitation and nutritional interventions on (A) changes in physical scores, (B) quality of life, and (C) frailty scores in frail patients with cardiovascular disease. SMD = standardized mean difference.Central IllustrationEffect of Frailty on Cardiovascular Clinical Trials: A Systematic Review and Meta-AnalysisSummary of the main aim, methodology, results, and conclusion of the present study. Overview of main findings of (A) clinical outcomes in frail and prefrail patients, (B) clinical outcomes of trial interventions stratified by frailty status, and (C) frailty-specific outcomes of rehabilitative and nutritional studies. CV = cardiovascular; MACE = major adverse cardiac events; RCT = randomized controlled trial; SMD = standardized mean difference.Publication biasVisual assessment of funnel plots suggests potential publication bias for SMDs of physical scores and quality of life scores but not other outcome measures, although this is limited by the small sample size (n<10 studies) (Supplemental Figures 7 to 13). Egger test did not demonstrate significant publication bias in any outcome measure (P > 0.05 for all outcomes) (Supplemental Table 3).DiscussionThe main findings of this meta-analysis are: 1) frailty is associated with an increased risk of CV events and mortality; 2) a significant proportion of CV interventions remain efficacious regardless of frailty status; and 3) CV interventions potentially improve physical function and quality of life (Central Illustration), but the trials varied widely in their reported frailty indices and outcome measures, and most analyses had been performed post hoc, which are prone to bias. There is a significant degree of heterogeneity in most outcomes reported, and the results should be interpreted and applied in context. The above findings should be considered hypothesis generating until dedicated large-scale RCTs are performed.Patients with frailty are historically underrepresented in RCTs, as suggested by the limited number of trials for each CV intervention and condition in the current analysis. This may be due to comorbidities, economic constraints, communication difficulties, and physical immobility,48 which reduce their participation rate in trials. For instance, in the case of heart failure, the uncertainty surrounding the side effects and tolerance of heart failure treatment in frail patients—as a result of their underrepresentation in RCTs—may deter clinicians from initiating optimal medical therapy.49,50 In the GUIDE-IT (Guiding Evidence Based Therapy Using Biomarker Intensified Treatment in Heart Failure) trial, patients with heart failure and a higher frailty burden were less likely to be uptitrated to an optimal guideline-directed medical therapy regimen.37 This is being increasingly recognized, and contemporary trials are attempting to include this underrepresented group of patients.22,24,46 Despite this, frailty analysis in most trials involves post hoc analysis rather than formal frailty assessment at trial inclusion.14,31,35,44 While this allows for comparison of frailty/prefrail vs nonfrail participants within individual RCTs, it has been shown to be inaccurate when comparing frailty levels between RCTs due to differing measures of frailty.12 This is exemplified in the current meta-analysis, where variable nonstandardized frailty indices and scoring systems were used across studies, which complicates definitive conclusions. The majority of studies measured frailty based on Rockwood cumulative deficit model.51 Although well-validated, the number and type of variables used to calculate the Rockwood Frailty Index varied widely among the studies with the number ranging from 30 to 60 items, which precludes direct comparisons of trial findings. Further, it is time-consuming to calculate the index, which limits clinical applicability outside of academic research. Notably, more recent trials, for example, REHAB-HF (Rehabilitation Therapy in Older Acute Heart Failure Patients) and MOSCA-FRAIL (Multicenter, Open-label, Study comparing Conservative vs Agressive treatment in FRAIL elderly patients with NSTEMI), have adopted simpler methods, including the Clinical Frailty Score and Fried Frailty Criteria,27,46 which augurs well for future downstream clinical translation.Our findings of frailty as a predictor of increased risk of adverse clinical outcomes across a range of CV conditions are consistent with prior reports.11,31,33,34,37,45 Frailty is associated with increased mortality and hospitalizations in patients with heart failure with either reduced or preserved ejection fractions.37,45 In patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarctions, frailty is associated with increased risks of adverse CV outcomes, independent of cardiovascular risk score and other significant covariates.11,33,52 In patients with atrial fibrillation, frailty is associated with increased risks of major bleeding and CV events, as well as with high residual risk even after treatment.34 Change in frailty status is also a prognostic marker.53 Change in physical function after transcatheter aortic valve replacement, more than baseline function itself, was associated with increased risk of mortality and hospitalizations.38 Our meta-analysis, in conjunction with these multiple streams of evidence, supports frailty as a prognostic factor in CV patients.The belief that frailty is associated with reduced treatment efficacy and increased harm may deter physicians from providing appropriate treatment, especially intensive pharmacological or high-risk procedures.49,50,54,55 Across all trial interventions across the frailty spectrum, our meta-analysis suggests a trend toward greater MACE (HR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.74-0.88, P < 0.001) and hospitalization benefit (HR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.72-0.90, P < 0.001) with increasing frailty status, although these interactions were nonsignificant (frailty × MACE: P = 0.90; frailty × hospitalizations: P = 0.25). Subgroup analyses of pharmacological interventions (in heart failure or hypertension trials) also suggest efficacy without increased mortality risks. Despite this, an individualized approach should be adopted, as intensive hypertension treatment may be associated with an increased risk of side effects. Interestingly, heart failure hospitalization rates were not significantly reduced with pharmacological intervention in nonfrail patients despite strong existing evidence of the benefits of pharmacological therapy in reducing heart failure hospitalization. We hypothesize that the observed benefit of reduced heart failure hospitalization may be more profound in frailer patients, driving overall results. This observation emphasizes the value of frailty assessment in heart failure trials in amplifying the importance of guideline-directed medical therapy in heart failure. On the other hand, MACE outcomes were significantly better in nonfrail and frail patients but not in prefrail patients (HR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.69-1.01, P = 0.06) with pharmacological and rehabilitative interventions. This may be due to fewer trials that have reported MACE outcomes in prefrail patients (n = 5), resulting in a larger CI and nonsignificant P value. Compared with frailty, a prefrail definition is less well-defined, which may lead to ambiguity in its classification.The trend of improved MACE and hospitalization outcomes appears to be driven mainly by trials of heart failure.28,32,35,42 The key endpoints in many heart failure trials encompass composite outcomes that include hospitalizations in addition to all-cause or CV mortality,31,32,42 and the efficacy benefits observed among frail participants are largely driven by hospitalization events.28,31,32,42 This was consistent across a range of heart failure interventions (both pharmacological and rehabilitative) and in both heart failure with preserved and reduced ejection fractions.31,42,43 In a separate, more robust analysis of frailty index as a continuous variable, sacubitril/valsartan seemed to be more effective in frailer patients.42 In contrast, the MOSCA-FRAIL,46 CANTOS (Canakinumab Anti-inflammatory Thrombosis Outcomes Study),14 and ELDERCARE-AF (Edoxaban Low-Dose for Elder Care Atrial Fibrillation Patients)40 trials—which involve myocardial infarction and atrial fibrillation participants, respectively—were neutral for composite key MACE outcomes. The latter often include ischemic outcomes such as myocardial infarction and stroke but not hospitalization events,14,46 unlike in heart failure trials. The mechanisms for this preferential reduction in hospitalizations in frail patients with heart failure medications are not well elucidated,42 and the presence of selection bias cannot be excluded as well. If substantiated in further trials, these findings might be clinically significant given the current reluctance of physicians to introduce medications in this group of patients.31,42 Clearly, there is a need for dedicated subgroup analysis for frail individuals in future RCTs.Beyond hard clinical endpoints, an increasing number of trials have begun exploring frailty-specific outcomes such as physical function, quality of life, cognitive impairment, and psychiatric outcomes such as depression.19,20,27,28,30 However, a common limitation among these trials is the significant heterogeneity in outcome measures, which limits the ability to directly compare outcomes between studies. This is not only seen in CV trials but also in trials involving frail patients across a range of disciplines.56 Similar to the International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement standardized reporting outcomes for other CV conditions,57, 58, 59 inclusion of patients with frailty into trials warrants a need for a standardized set of outcome measures for frailty-specific outcomes, including physical function, quality of life, cognition, depression, and standardized frailty assessments.The use of nonpharmacological interventions, such as cardiac rehabilitation and nutritional support with CV trials, is a key feature for patients with frailty. Cardiac rehabilitation with or without nutritional interventions has a role in tackling physical deconditioning, reduced quality of life, and depression, which are common among heart failure patients with prolonged hospitalization.20,27 In our analysis, cardiac rehabilitation and nutritional support significantly improved physical functioning (SMD: 0.15, 95% CI: 0.04-0.26) and quality of life (SMD: 0.15, 95% CI: 0.09-0.21) but not overall frailty (SMD: 0.09, 95% CI: −0.04 to 0.22). Frailty scores embody a variety of different domains (eg, social and cognitive) that may not all respond to these interventions. While frailty score may define the phenotype, intervention efficacy may be better assessed via specific frailty-related domains rather than the overall score. Of note, 4 of the 10 trials were judged to be at moderate risk of bias, which may be a limitation of the relatively small sample size of these trials and inability to blind participants, and results should be interpreted in light of this.Unsurprisingly, the magnitude of benefit of these interventions appeared to be greater in patients who were most frail.27,28 Frail patients with heart failure responded better to physical rehabilitation, with a greater improvement in physical scores and functional status compared to prefrail patients.28,32 The REHAB-HF trial demonstrated that in a group of predominantly frail or prefrail patients with heart failure, a frailty-specific rehabilitation program resulted in greater improvements in physical function than usual care, with similar rates of rehospitalization and death in both groups.27 The reasons for this apparent benefit are multifactorial. Aerobic exercise therapies have been associated with downregulation of proinflammatory pathways and improvements in sarcopenia, endothelial function, mitochondrial function, and skeletal muscle use, which are thought to be pathophysiological mechanisms of frailty in heart failure.28,32 Furthermore, the possibility of frail patients having a greater rehabilitation potential given their worse baseline function cannot be excluded as well.28 The above benefits were not only seen in other cohorts of heart failure patients24, 25, 26 but also seen in other CV trials examining frail patients after myocardial infarction22,29 and valve replacement.30 Despite the benefits of cardiac rehabilitation, referral rates of patients remain low, with an estimated 1 in 4 patients referred to cardiac rehabilitation.60Within the present meta-analysis, we did not find any aggregate evidence of increased adverse clinical outcomes in frail patients, although individual studies might have reported evidence of harm in specific clinical contexts. In frail older adults, despite evidence of novel oral anticoagulants having a generally lower bleeding risk, switching to a novel oral anticoagulant from warfarin was associated with an increased risk of bleeding compared to those remaining on warfarin.47 Edoxaban was also associated with higher rates of bleeding than warfarin in patients who were most frail.34 In the CANTOS trial, canakinumab was observed to paradoxically increase the risk of frailty in patients who have persistently high inflammatory markers. There is also ambiguity regarding the role of a routine invasive treatment for acute coronary syndromes. Previous RCTs on older adults support an invasive strategy for patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, as it lowers rates of repeat myocardial infarction or urgent revascularization; however, these trials did not specifically account for frailty status.61 The recent MOSCA-FRAIL trial did not find a significant impact on days alive and out of hospital for a routine invasive strategy in frail patients, suggesting the need for further, frailty-specific clinical trials.46 More insights from trials that study the impact of cardiac defibrillators on frail vs nonfrail patients would also be important. There is also evidence that implantable cardiac defibrillators show a mortality benefit in nonfrail individuals with heart failure but not frail individuals.62 Beyond CV trials, prior reviews have demonstrated varying degrees of benefit of clinical interventions along the frailty spectrum for a range of clinical conditions.56 Certain interventions demonstrated greater benefits in patients with higher (eg, physical rehabilitation) or lower (eg, intensive lifestyle interventions) frailty status; others demonstrated consistent benefits across the frailty spectrum (eg, vaccinations and antihypertensives).56 The present study supports the above findings in the context of CV trials, providing additional quantitative evidence of the effect of frailty as an effect modifier. An understanding of the nuances of the effects of different interventions in patients with frailty, in addition to clinical contextualization in CV trials, may be necessary.Strengths and limitationsTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis pooling RCT outcomes in CV patients across a range of interventions across the frailty spectrum. Furthermore, the pooling of HRs is the most appropriate method for analysis of time-to-event data. Despite these merits, our study has several limitations. Due to the wide range of frailty tools and assessment tools used in these trials, there is significant heterogeneity in the pooled data, and results should be interpreted accordingly. Ideally, assignment of frail, prefrail, and nonfrail groups could be based on standardized phenotypic observations and/or frailty scores, which was not possible due to heterogeneity of methods. For RCTs that had multiple categories of frailty severity, we arbitrarily regrouped them into 3 predefined groups to simplify analysis. There is significant heterogeneity regarding the type of CV condition and trial interventions tested, limiting the generalizability of the results. The limited number of studies of each condition and intervention precluded further subgroup analysis stratified by CV condition and interventions. While our meta-analysis included the major categories of CVDs, other minor CV conditions could still have been excluded.Nonetheless, this meta-analysis provides evidence for the benefit of intervention even in the frailest groups of participants, which addresses certain gaps and concerns among physicians regarding participation of patients with frailty in RCTs.ConclusionsFrailty is associated with worse outcomes, but certain CV interventions, especially rehabilitative interventions, remain beneficial across the frailty spectrum and should not be withheld solely on the basis of frailty status. There is a need for further large-scale clinical trials on a range of CV interventions dedicated to the frail population along with the use of a standardized set of outcome measures specific to frailty.PerspectivesCOMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: Frailty and CVD frequently co-exist. Frailty acts as a prognosticating factor in these patients, independent of their inherent cardiovascular risk. Frailty status itself does not necessarily reduce the efficacy of intervention, even in the frailest patients.COMPETENCY IN PATIENT CARE: In frail patients with an indication for cardiovascular interventions, the decision to pursue interventions should be made after a combined decision with the patient with discussion of the risks and benefits, and not solely based on frailty status alone.TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK 1: The significant heterogeneity and nonstandardized use of frailty assessment tools are major limitations to the applicability of results. There is a need for purposeful inclusion of patients with frailty in future randomized trials and the use of standardized assessment and reporting outcomes for frailty.TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK 2: While we observe a suggested benefit of cardiovascular interventions in the frailest population for selected outcomes, the mechanisms remain unknown. Additional research is needed to understand the mechanisms and interactions between frailty and cardiovascular interventions.Funding support and author disclosuresDr Koh has received grant funding from the 10.13039/501100001349National Medical Research Council of Singapore (MOH-001200, MOH-000153, MOH-000762, and MOH-001193).

{"PMCID": "11887560", "title": "Comparison of Endovascular Interventions for the Treatment of Superficial Femoral Artery Disease: A Network Meta-analysis", "abstract": "BackgroundTo understand the relative safety and efficacy of endovascular treatment modalities used for superficial femoral artery (SFA) disease, we performed a network meta-analysis to compare outcomes between percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), atherectomy (A), bare metal stent (BMS), brachytherapy/radiotherapy, covered stent graft (CSG), cutting balloon angioplasty (CBA), drug-coated balloon (DCB), drug-eluting stent (DES), and intravascular lithotripsy (L).MethodsWe performed a systematic literature search of PubMed from January 2000 to January 2023 to identify randomized trials comparing endovascular interventions for the treatment of SFA disease. The primary end points were technical success and 12-month primary patency.ResultsIn total, 57 studies (9089 patients) were included. The mean age of the included patients was 68.4 years, 41.4% had diabetes, 18.3% had critical limb ischemia, and 81.3% had de novo lesions. A mean of 1.2 lesions were treated per patient. Technical success was superior for CSG, BMS, and A+DCB compared with PTA, while A+DCB and CSG were superior to DCB. All interventions except brachytherapy alone had superior primary patency compared with PTA. There were no significant differences in 12-month mortality or major amputation. All interventions except L+DCB, PTA+A, and CBA were superior to PTA regarding target lesion revascularization, while only DCB, DES, and BMS were better than PTA at improving Rutherford classification.ConclusionsIn SFA disease, PTA alone is mostly inferior to other endovascular techniques. This comparison of other endovascular techniques will be valuable for endovascular device selection in the treatment of SFA disease.", "body": "IntroductionPeripheral arterial disease (PAD) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with increasing prevalence and associated health care costs.1,2 Chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI), the most severe form of PAD, is associated with a significant risk of amputation and death.3 Disease of the superficial femoral artery (SFA) is the leading cause of both intermittent claudication (IC) and CLTI.4 Treatment of PAD often includes revascularization of the lower extremities, either by endovascular intervention or surgical bypass. Currently there is conflicting randomized evidence on whether surgical bypass or modern endovascular therapy is superior for various cohorts of CLTI patients.5,6 Regardless, endovascular revascularization of the lower extremities is indicated in many patients with SFA disease, including patients needing revascularization for IC resistant to medical management, those without adequate venous grafts, poor surgical candidates, or those who prefer a less invasive endovascular approach.7, 8, 9The rapid growth of new endovascular therapies and new randomized controlled trials (RCTs) testing their effects in PAD patients has led to a significant amount of new data over the past decade10, 11, 12, 13; however, it remains unclear how each novel therapy should fit into real-world practice. Both the American and European guidelines highlight the lack of high quality and comprehensive evidence in this space and call for further data to be gathered.14,15 Thus, understanding the relative safety and efficacy of each intervention will help guide decision making in treating patients and may inform future guidelines. Thus, we conducted a network meta-analysis of RCTs to compare the safety and efficacy of endovascular treatment modalities for SFA disease.MethodsSearch strategyWe performed a network meta-analysis following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.16 The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42022377373). A systematic literature search of PubMed was completed including studies from January 2000 to January 2023 to identify RCTs comparing ≥2 endovascular interventions for the treatment of SFA disease that were published in the English language. The specific search terms used were (“femoral” or “femoropopliteal” or “peripheral artery”) AND (“endovascular” OR “angioplasty” OR “balloon” OR “stent” OR “atherectomy” OR “lithotripsy”). The bibliographies of relevant studies were also examined to identify other potentially relevant studies.Inclusion/exclusion criteriaThe studies were screened by 2 independent authors (A.S. and T.S.) and were included if they were RCTs that compared ≥2 endovascular interventions for the treatment of SFA disease (IC and/or CLTI) in patients aged >18 years. Studies were excluded if they did not report any of the primary or secondary outcomes of this meta-analysis or if they did not have independent core laboratory adjudication of angiographic and/or ultrasound outcomes. Studies that reported on the same trial were included and searched for relevant data and were counted as one study in total. Any discrepancy was resolved by a third reviewer (Y.S.). Endovascular interventions and their combinations included in the study were percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), percutaneous transluminal angioplasty + atherectomy (PTA+A); drug-coated balloon (DCB), lithotripsy + drug-coated balloon (L+DCB), atherectomy + drug-coated balloon (A+DCB), drug-coated balloon + bare metal stent (DCB+BMS), drug-eluting stent (DES), bare metal stent (BMS), brachytherapy/radiation therapy (brachy), bare metal stent + brachytherapy/radiation therapy (BMS+brachy), covered stent graft (CSG), and cutting balloon angioplasty (CBA).Data extractionFor every selected study, 2 authors (A.S., T.S, and/or Y.S.) read the text and extracted study details, sample size, patient demographics and comorbidities, lesion characteristics, and procedural characteristics. Discrepancies were reviewed by the 2 reviewers to reach consensus. Claude-3-Opus (Anthropic) was used to verify data extraction, and any discrepancies were verified and corrected.OutcomesThe primary efficacy outcome was 12-month primary patency, defined as freedom from >50% restenosis (peak systolic velocity ratio <2.5 on duplex ultrasound) of the treated lesion and freedom from target lesion revascularization (TLR). The primary procedural outcome was technical success, defined as <30% residual stenosis on immediate postintervention angiogram.The secondary 12-month safety outcomes were major amputation, defined as any leg amputation proximal to the ankle, all-cause death, and TLR, defined as revascularization of the treated arterial segment. The secondary efficacy outcomes included primary patency at 6 months, 12-month improvement in Rutherford category by ≥1, mean change of Walking Impairment Questionnaire score, and mean change of EuroQol-5 Dimension score, which is a standardized questionnaire to measure health-related quality of life. One-month TLR, 6-month and 12-month late lumen loss, and 1-month all-cause death were prespecified secondary end points, but they were not reported due to the limited number of studies available to include in the network.Statistical analysisCategorical variables, such as patient demographics, are reported as percentages whereas continuous variables are reported as mean ± SD. A network meta-analysis was conducted through simultaneous analysis of direct comparisons of interventions within RCTs and indirect comparison across trials using common comparators. Heterogeneity between studies was assessed using I2. Random effect models were used, given the intermediate heterogeneity across trials. When available, PTA was used as a control comparator. The effect estimate for each of the outcomes is presented as an odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI. Prediction intervals were also calculated for each primary outcome. P-scores, which measure the certainty that a treatment is better than other treatments, were calculated based on meta-analytic point estimates and standard errors and used to rank order different interventions.17Meta-regression was used to identify if effect sizes of various interventions varied by proportion of various subgroups included in the trials. Subgroups tested included age, female sex, diabetes, current smoking status, chronic kidney disease, end-stage renal disease, CLTI, total occlusions, severe calcification, and de novo lesions. Only results of DCB vs PTA meta-regressions are shown, given the limited number of studies available for other comparisons to conduct meta-regression. We did not account for multiple testing in the primary analysis because the comparisons were only hypothesis-generating and we did not expect to find significant results for most tested subgroups. As a sensitivity analysis we used the Bonferroni method to account for multiple testing.Risk of biasA risk of bias assessment was completed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool.18 Each study was evaluated in 5 different categories to determine an overall risk of bias, including randomization process, deviation from the intended intervention, missing outcome data, measurement of the outcome, and selection of reported results. Publication bias was assessed by funnel plots and asymmetry tests (Egger’s test).ResultsStudy selectionThe search identified 555 total studies with 81 references encompassing 57 studies (9089 total patients) included in the final analysis (Figure 1).10,13,19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73 Details of all included studies are presented in Supplemental Table S1. Four of the included studies reported only on secondary outcomes for which there was not enough data to develop a network.19,34,44,45 The studies were found to generally be at low risk of bias (Supplemental Table S2) and there was no evidence of publication bias (Supplemental Figures S1 and S2).Figure 1PRISMA flow diagram of the networkmeta-analysis.Cohort characteristicsThe baseline characteristics of the population are outlined in Table 1.

A total of 41.4% had diabetes mellitus, 41.2% were current smokers, 68.1% had dyslipidemia, 79.3% had hypertension, and 12.8% had renal insufficiency. The mean target leg ankle–brachial index was 0.6, most patients had Rutherford Class 3 (63.1%), and 18.3% had CLTI before intervention. A mean of 1.2 lesions were treated per patient with 81.3% being de novo lesions (Table 2).

When ranked, DCB+BMS had the highest P-score (0.99) (Table 3).A limited number of trials assessed 12-month changes in EuroQol-5 Dimension and Walking Impairment Questionnaire scores. Although point estimates favored DCB over PTA, they were not significant.Meta-regression analysisBased on meta-regression, trials comparing DCB vs PTA with a higher proportion of de novo lesions (P < .0001), female patients (P = .04), and severely calcified lesions (P = .03) had greater effect size for DCBs improving Rutherford category. Trials with a higher proportion of de novo lesions (P = .014) had greater effect size favoring DCBs for 12-month TLR. Trials with a higher proportion of chronic total occlusions (P = .008) had greater 12-month mortality in the DCB arms (Supplementary Table S5). When accounting for multiple testing, only effect modification of de novo lesions remained significant.DiscussionThis network meta-analysis, based on rigorously conducted contemporary RCTs with independent and core laboratory adjudication of end points, provides up to date, comprehensive and clinically relevant insights into the relative safety and efficacy of the numerous endovascular devices available to treat SFA disease in primarily IC patients. Technical success was highest for CSG, BMS, and A+DCB, and 12-month primary patency was superior for virtually all newer endovascular interventions compared with PTA (Central Illustration). Therapies with improved primary patency compared to PTA were also associated with more frequent improvement in symptoms, with DCB+BMS being particularly highly ranked for 12-month improvement in Rutherford classification. The 12-month mortality and major amputation rates were similar between treatments, although these comparisons were limited by the small number of studies included and low event rates (considering most were IC patients who generally have lower rates of these events than CLTI patients). Comparisons of changes in Walking Impairment Questionnaire and EuroQol-5 Dimension were also limited by number of studies, although their point estimates favored DCB over PTA.Central IllustrationPrimary end points network plots of (A) technical success and (B) 12-month primary patency.

It also showed that PTA was inferior to other interventions, including DCBs, in symptom improvement. This is not surprising because negative remodeling and neointimal hyperplasia following PTA are mitigated by therapies such as stents and DCBs.76, 77, 78 This adds to the growing evidence that a PTA-alone strategy for SFA disease is insufficient79 for most lesions despite it being used in up to 30% of cases.5,80 Although PTA alone may have been overused in the past due to the now discredited link between paclitaxel and increased mortality,81, 82, 83 these results highlight the benefit of drug-eluting therapy.This study addresses, in part, the gap in knowledge regarding device selection in femoropopliteal disease identified by previous guidelines.9,15 Both documents give relatively little guidance on device selection and only give weak recommendations for newer therapies relative to PTA and only when PTA gives a suboptimal result. Our study shows that technical success is superior with the use of newer endovascular therapies as a first-line strategy. Additionally, 12-month primary patency and even more importantly, patient symptoms, are also improved when newer endovascular therapies are used as a first-line strategy. As drug-eluting therapies including DCBs continue to become standard of care for these patients, the comparisons presented here using DCB as the comparator will provide valuable insight for device selection in modern practice.Highly calcified SFA lesions are difficult to treat due to decreased vessel compliance, increased risk of dissection with balloon expansion, and decreased delivery of drug therapy.84 Currently, the mainstay therapy for highly calcified lesions includes vessel preparation strategies with intravascular L and A, often followed by PTA or DCB.30,85,86 Our analysis suggests both are viable options, particularly when paired with DCBs, given that L+DCB and A+DCB were highly ranked for 12-month primary patency. However, given the limited number of studies including these interventions, this result should be interpreted with caution.Subgroup analyses by meta-regression suggested that patients with de novo lesions had greater benefit from DCB for symptom improvement and TLR compared with those with in-stent restenosis. It is well established that DCBs are superior to PTA alone in patients with in-stent restenosis49,50,52; however, this study demonstrates that the benefit is less strong than in de novo lesions. There is abundant evidence that DCBs are superior for heavily calcified lesions59,87 and for women,88 which are both supported by our meta-regression analysis as well. Although our meta-regression analysis suggested there may be increased mortality with DCBs in trials that enrolled more patients with total occlusions, this does not have a physiologic basis and, as mentioned above, this association has been repeatedly debunked. More likely this finding was the result of type I error from multiple testing as evidenced by all meta-regressions, besides those looking at de novo lesions, no longer being significant after adjusting P values for multiple testing.LimitationsThis study has several limitations. First, this is a post hoc analysis of trial-level data; therefore, these results are only hypothesis-generating. For many comparisons there was significant heterogeneity across trials, likely reflecting the varying patient/lesion selection in the trials for different devices, which may affect the interpretability of the results, particularly for interventions used in vastly different patient populations. However, in most cases, heterogeneity was at most moderate89 and was explained by differences in baseline characteristics identified by meta-regression including lesion calcification and in-stent restenosis lesions. Additionally, many outcomes and interventions had few, if any, studies contributing to the network, limiting many comparisons and making the results susceptible to selection bias based on which studies reported which outcomes. Finally, the cohort had a male predominance, which limits the generalizability of the results to the broader population, although this is a limitation in trial enrollment and not one specifically of this meta-analysis.ConclusionThis network meta-analysis supports the benefit of new endovascular therapies, including drug-eluting therapy, for the treatment of SFA disease compared with PTA alone. Future studies focused on device selection in SFA disease are warranted."}

Previous studies have reported silent cerebral lesions (SCLs) detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after different CA techniques; however, the results were controversial. Therefore, we performed this network meta-analysis (NMA) to assess the incidence of SCLs after cryoballoon, hotballoon, laserballoon, and radiofrequency ablation (RFA).MethodsDatabases such as PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched systematically. Both pairwise meta-analysis (PMA) and NMA were conducted. The primary outcome was the incidence of new SCLs on MRI after CA procedures.ResultsNine studies were analyzed and 1,057 patients were enrolled. Laserballoon ablation (LBA) had a higher incidence of SCLs than cryoballoon ablation (CBA) [odds ratio [OR] = 1.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06–3.27, p = 0.032] in the PMA, while no significant difference was detected between the CA techniques according to the NMA. The surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) values indicated that CBA may be the best therapeutic option (SUCRA = 81.1%). The NMA results demonstrated similar procedure-related complication rates and mean activated clotting time between CBA (SUCRA = 53.7%, 66.3%), hotballoon ablation (HBA) (SUCRA = 81.5%, 43.6%), LBA (SUCRA = 3.39%, 42.8%) and RFA (SUCRA = 61.3%, 47.3%). LBA therapy required significantly more procedure time than CBA [weighted mean difference (WMD) = 24.36 min, 95% CI 12.51–36.21 min, p = 0.00].ConclusionsCBA treatment had lower incidence of post-procedural SCLs and took less procedure time compared with LBA for patients with AF. The procedure-related complications were comparable between CBA, LBA, HBA and RFA.Systematic Review RegistrationPROSPERO, identifier (CRD42024511110).", "body": "1IntroductionAtrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac arrhythmia in clinical practice, and can lead to increased risk of cognitive decline and ischemic stroke (1, 2). Many guidelines have recommended catheter ablation (CA) as first-line treatment for the purpose of restoring and maintaining sinus rhythm in patients with symptomatic AF (3). Several previous studies have evaluated neurocognitive outcomes and reported the incidence of silent cerebral lesions (SCLs) detected by cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) following CA for AF, ranging from 1.7 to 38% (4, 5). SCLs, also known as asymptomatic cerebral lesions, are defined as cerebral lesions that display radiological evidence of focal ischemia without resulting in acute symptoms (6, 7). SCLs were reported to be associated with progressive neurocognitive decline and an increased risk of developing dementia (8). Different ablation techniques for AF have been compared with regard to the rates of SCLs; However, the results are controversial and most of the studies included small patient numbers (6). We conducted the present systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) to fully assess and compare the incidence and characteristics of SCLs following cryoballoon ablation (CBA), laser balloon ablation (LBA), hot balloon ablation (HBA) and irrigated radiofrequency ablation (RFA) therapy for patients with AF.2Materials and methods2.1Literature search strategy and study selectionWe searched scientific databases and websites, such as PubMed (MEDLINE), Embase, the Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov up to June 2024. The following keywords and their variants were used: “atrial fibrillation”, “catheter ablation” and “silent cerebral lesions”. The reference lists of the relevant articles were further browsed. Clinical trials that met the following criteria were included: (1) article in English, (2) original data comparing cryoballoon, hotballoon, laserballoon and irrigated radiofrequency catheter ablation for AF, (3) cerebral MRI examination was performed after CA treatment and (4) adequate data regarding the outcomes of interest.2.2Data collection and quality assessmentTwo authors (TTZ and YJK) extracted the data of interest and assessed the qualities independently. The Cochrane Collaboration tool was used to assess the methodological qualities of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (9), while the ROBINS-I tool (10) was applied for the non-randomized trials. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion or by referral to a third assessor where necessary. The following data from the included trials were extracted: the features of the studies, the baseline characteristics of the participants, CA strategies, and outcomes of interest.2.3Primary and secondary outcomesThe primary outcome was the occurrence of new SCLs on MRI examination following CBA, HBA, LBA, and RFA treatments. Secondary outcomes of interest included total procedure-related complications, CA procedure time and mean activated clotting time (ACT) during the procedure.2.4Statistical analysisCategorical variables were represented as percentages, while continuous variables were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Data analysis for pairwise meta-analysis (PMA) was conducted using the STATA software (v15.1). The estimated weighted mean difference (WMD) and odds ratio (OR) with their 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. For Bayesian network meta-analysis, the R software (version 3.6.2) was applied to calculate the mean difference (MD)/OR and the 95% credible interval (CrI). We performed Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for sampling the posterior probabilities from 100,000 iterations via Gibbs sampling. We used the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) probabilities to rank each CA therapy type for certain outcomes. Pairwise heterogeneity was evaluated with the chi-squared test. If moderate to significant heterogeneity was observed, additional subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed. The node-splitting method was used to test the consistency (11). Publication bias was evaluated by funnel plots. Egger's and Begg's tests were also applied to statistically assess the bias. The protocol of this network meta-analysis was registered in the PROSPERO (CRD42024511110).3Results3.1Eligible studies and characteristicsA total of 282 clinical trials were identified after electronic database searching, and 9 studies (12–20) with a total of 1,057 participants were eventually enrolled. (Figure 1) The features and baseline characteristics of these studies and participants are exhibited in Table 1. Briefly, across the trials, one study compared HBA with CBA (15), five trials compared CBA with RFA (12–14, 16, 19), two studies compared LBA, CBA and RFA (17, 20), and one study compared these four CA therapies concurrently (18). (Figure 2) Three studies only included patients with paroxysmal AF (PAF) (12, 17, 18), while the remaining studies enrolled mixed cohort of patients with AF, including both persistent AF (PerAF) and PAF patients. The CBA group contained 419 patients, the HBA group had 108 patients, the LBA group contained 128 patients, and the RFA group had 402 patients. The mean age across studies was 61.0 years, and the median CHA2DS2-VASc score was 1.8. Oral anticoagulant (OAC) treatments during the procedure were uninterrupted in four studies (13, 15, 18, 19), while discontinued in four studies (12, 14, 16, 17). According to the quality assessment results via the Cochrane Collaboration tool (9) and ROBINS-I tool (10), all the studies included in the analysis were of relatively good qualities. There was no significant publication bias according to the results of funnel plot (Supplementary Figure S1) and Egger's and Begg's tests (Egger's: p = 0.395; Begg's: p = 0.343), based on the primary outcome.Figure 1Flow chart of the systematic literature research.Table 1Baseline characteristics of the included studies.StudyYearStudy type\nN\nTreatmentPAF (%)Mean age (years)Male (%)Mean LVEF (%)Mean LAd (mm)DM (%)Hypertention (%)Stroke/TIA (%)Median CHA2DS2-VAScOAC during the procedureNakamura2019Prospective123HBA vs. CBA95.16568.3633817.146.36.51.9UninterruptedGlowniak2019Prospective48CBA vs. RFA89.6597564.942.820.8758.31.7Uninterruptedvon Bary2015Prospective28CBA vs. RFA73.163NR5843NR61.5NRNRUninterruptedHerrera Siklody2011Prospective50CBA vs. RFA566170NR41.1NR60NR1.7DiscontinuedGaita2011Prospective72CBA vs. RFA1005668.163.542NR54.2NRNRDiscontinuedNeumann2011Prospective89CBA vs. RFA80.95762.960524.555.1NRNRDiscontinuedWissner2014Prospective86LBA vs. CBA vs. RFA776363644296682NRSchmidt2013RCT99LBA vs. CBA vs. RFA10065NR594067372DiscontinuedTokuda2022Prospective462HBA vs. LBA vs. CBA vs. RFA10059.779.464.436.97.841.14.31.3UninterruptedPAF, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, LVEF, left ventricular ejection fraction, LAd, left atrial diameter, DM, diabetes mellitus, TIA, transient ischemia attack, OAC, oral anticoagulant, NR, not reported, HBA, hot balloon ablation, LBA, laser balloon ablation, CBA, cryoballoon ablation, RFA, radiofrequency ablation, RCT, randomized controlled trial.Figure 2Network of comparisons included in the analyses.

The PMA analysis exhibited that, LBA had significantly higher SCL occurrence than CBA after AF procedure (25.0% vs. 20.8%, OR = 1.86, p = 0.032) (Figure 3). No significant heterogeneity was detected (I2 = 0%). No significant differences were found regarding to SCL occurrence between CBA vs. RFA (OR = 0.70, p = 0.075), LBA vs. RFA (OR = 1.15, p = 0.605), HBA vs. RFA (OR = 1.20, p = 0.590), HBA vs. CBA (OR = 1.05, p = 0.926), and HBA vs. LBA (OR = 0.87, p = 0.733) (Figure 3).Figure 3Forest plot for the outcome of SCLs from pairwise meta-analysis. HBA, hot balloon ablation; LBA, laser balloon ablation; CBA, cryoballoon ablation; RFA, radiofrequency ablation; OR, odds ratio.Results from the NMA demonstrated that, compared with RFA, CBA (OR = 0.72), HBA (OR = 0.82) and LBA (OR = 1.1) showed similar occurrence rates of SCLs after AF procedure. (Figure 4) No significant differences in SCLs recurrence was found between these four CA treatments for AF (Supplementary Table S1). The SUCRA results indicated that, CBA may be the optimal therapeutic option (SUCRA = 81.1%), followed by HBA (SUCRA = 61.4%), RFA (SUCRA = 35.1%) and LBA (SUCRA = 22.4%) (Figure 5). Good consistency was detected, as the deviance information criterion (DIC) values were similar regarding to the primary endpoint (DIC 33.73, I2 = 0% vs. DIC 33.70, I2 = 0%).Figure 4Forest plots of network meta-analysis for the primary and secondary outcomes.

PMA demonstrated similar SCL numbers between CBA vs. RFA (OR = 0.67, p = 0.075) and LBA vs. CBA (OR = 2.16, p = 0.143). LBA treatment was found to have less total SCL numbers than RFA (OR = 0.46, p = 0.046). (Supplementary Figure S2). We found significant heterogeneity in the comparison between CBA and RFA (I2 = 74.3%), while this was not detected for the comparisons between LBA vs. RFA (I2 = 0%) and LBA vs. CBA (I2 = 0%). NMA was not conducted due to the lack of sufficient comparisons.3.3Secondary endpoints3.3.1Procedure-related complicationsFive of the included trials (13–15, 17, 20) provided data on procedure-related complications. According to the results of the PMA, the CBA (6.6%), HBA (5.1%), LBA (2.6%) and RFA groups (4.9%) had comparable complication rates (CBA vs. RFA: OR = 1.09, p = 0.896; LBA vs. RFA: OR = 2.65, p = 0.535; HBA vs. CBA: OR = 0.54, p = 0.394; LBA vs. CBA: OR = 2.41, p = 0.576). No significant heterogeneities were found for these comparisons (Supplementary Figure S3).The NMA analysis demonstrated comparable results regarding to the procedure-related complications between CBA (SUCRA = 53.7%), HBA (SUCRA = 81.5%), LBA (SUCRA = 3.39%) and RFA groups (SUCRA = 61.3%) (Figures 4, 5). Good consistency was detected with similar DIC values. (DIC 13.95, I2 = 0% vs. DIC 13.97, I2 = 0%).3.3.2Procedure timeEight studies (12–17, 19, 20) reported comparison data concerning procedure time. The results of the PMA indicated that, LBA required remarkably longer procedure time during CA compared to CBA (WMD = 24.36 min, p = 0.00). Similar procedure times were seen between CBA vs. RFA (WMD = −16.10 min, p = 0.237), LBA vs. RFA (WMD = 18.18 min, p = 0.537) and HBA vs. CBA (WMD = 10.00 min, p = 0.061). The moderate to significant heterogeneities for these comparisons should be noted (I2 = 93.9%, 90.4%, and 94.7%, respectively). (Supplementary Figure S4).The results of NMA exhibited that, CBA (WMD = −16. 0 min, SUCRA = 79.1%), HBA (WMD = −5.9 min, SUCRA = 54.6%) and LBA therapies (WMD = 14.0, SUCRA = 22.9%) had comparable procedure time, compared with RFA therapy (SUCRA = 43.4%). There was no significant difference regarding to the procedure time between the four CA treatments (Figures 4, 5).3.3.3Mean ACT during procedureFive studies (12, 15–17, 20) reported on the mean ACT during the procedure. The PMA demonstrated comparable mean ACT during CA for AF between CBA vs. RFA (WMD = 1.3 s, p = 0.892), LBA vs. RFA (WMD = −10.75 s, p = 0.257), HBA vs. CBA (WMD = −6.0 s, p = 0.542) and LBA vs. CBA (WMD = 1.15 s, p = 0.917) (Supplementary Figure S5). The NMA results also showed no significant differences regarding to the mean ACT during the procedure between CBA (SUCRA = 66.3%), HBA (SUCRA = 43.6%), LBA (SUCRA = 42.8%), and RFA (SUCRA = 47.3%) (Figures 4, 5).4DiscussionTo our knowledge, this is the first network meta-analysis that comprehensively compared the incidence of SCLs after CBA, HBA, LBA and RFA treatments for AF. The main findings were: (1) CBA therapy was associated with a significantly lower incidence of SCLs compared with LBA for patients with AF in the PMA, (2) no significant difference was detected regarding the incidence of SCLs between CBA, HBA, LBA and RFA for AF in the NMA, (3) LBA had less total SCLs numbers on MRI than RFA, (4) the four CA techniques showed comparable procedure related complications, and (5) LBA treatment required longer procedure time compared with CBA.CA has been the recommended therapy for symptomatic and drug-refectory patients with AF, to restore and maintain sinus rhythm (3); however, CA within the left atrium may lead to the formation of SCLs, which could be detected via MRI (6). While symptomatic embolism events, such as stroke and transient ischemic attack after CA for patients with AF are rare (21), increasing evidence suggests that the incidence of SCLs detected by cerebral MRI is relatively high, and has been reported to range from 1.7% to 42% (22, 23). Various factors could contribute to formation of SCLs during CA, such as air or thrombus, coagulum on the catheter, gas bubble formation, patient-related factors, electrical cardioversion during the procedure and certain types of ablation device (6, 18).Though many previous studies have investigated the influence of these factors on the incidence of post-procedural SCLs, no congruent result has been reached. Several studies have also compared the occurrence of SCLs after different ablation techniques, whereas results are also controversial (6). The RFA therapy for AF has been widely applied, and in recent years, many balloon-based ablation techniques, such as CBA, HBA and LBA, have also been developed, which have demonstrated comparable clinical efficacy and safety compared with RFA (24–26). In the present study, CBA was found to have a significantly lower incidence of SCLs than LBA in the PMA, but not in the NMA; this was consistent with the previous prospective, multicenter studies that investigated the incidence of SCLs after CBA and LBA respectively (20). Balloon-based techniques have been introduced and emerged as valuable alternatives to the traditional RFA procedure (27). Previous histological studies have reported that conventional RFA resulted in more extensive endothelial cell destruction, which may lead to the release of endothelial inflammatory cytokines and the activation of platelets, and increase the risk of thrombus formation (28). However, CBA has a lower thrombogenic nature, due to its well-delineated, discrete lesions that preserve the tissue ultrastructure (29).Compared with CBA, LBA has the advantage of direct endocardial visualization during the procedure (30); however, the residual blood between the balloon and left atrial wall during procedure may cause thrombus formation (18). In addition, the risk of SCLs after the procedure is associated with prolonged procedural times (31). In the present study, the procedure time was much longer with LBA than that with CBA. This was also consistent with the recent study by Wu et al., which demonstrated that LBA needed the most procedural time compared with CBA and HBA (27). LBA has the advantage of enabling a more precise titration of ablation lesions, whereas this would take up more procedure time, in contrast to the “single shot” techniques, such as HBA and CBA. Moreover, LBA lacks a specific mapping catheter within its system for the real-time recording of PV potential, which can further extend the procedural time, as another mapping catheter is required to verify PVI (27). These risk factors may in part explain the higher occurrence of SCLs found in the LBA treatment compared with CBA.Although LBA had a higher incidence of SCLs than CBA, it comprised less of the total SCL numbers than RFA in the PMA. As mentioned above, RFA tends to have a higher risk of thrombus formation due to the extensive endothelial cell destruction. Substantially more frequent occurrence of SCLs was also reported when using duty-cycled phased pulmonary vein ablation catheter (PVAC) and the NMARQ multielectrode catheter (22, 32). The newly introduced technology, high-power, short-duration ablation (HPSD) was also shown to be associated with an increased risk of SCLs (33, 34).However, notably, comparable occurrences and total numbers of SCLs were seen between the four techniques in the NMA, which used direct and indirect evidence. Possible explanations may be as follows: First, the total trial number and the studies included in the comparison between LBA and CBA were relatively small, which may inevitably cause bias. However, the studies included in the PMA for the outcome of SCLs between LBA vs. CBA and LBA vs. RFA were of good quality, and according to the GRADE approach (35), the results may still have a solid foundation of evidence. Second, the exact definitions of SCLs and the modalities of MRI scanning differed between studies, which may have affected the results. As it was reported that, a higher incidence of SCLs was seen with the technique of high-resolution diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) (7). Third, not all the included studies assessed the incidence of SCLs before the CA procedure. Previously, the MEDAFI study reported a rate of 12%, who had chronic SCLs prior to ablation (16). Thus it may be difficult to determine whether the SCLs were procedure-related. Therefore, these findings should be interpreted with caution.In the present study, the procedure-related complications were similar between CBA, HBA, LBA and RFA, and these were consistent with the previously published studies (36). However, occurrence of SCLs after CA for patients with AF remains a cogent cause of concern, as they may be associated with neurocognitive decline (6). Many previous studies have investigated the relationships between SCLs and neurocognitive outcomes. For example, the study by Vermeer et al. (8) and Sun et al. (37) showed that, SCLs led to an increased risk of dementia. However, as the study by Vermeer et al. (8) was almost 20 years ago, the risk relationship might have been changed due to the advances in treatment regimens and better control of risk factors (6). For example, the MEDAFI-trial found that, the incidence of SCLs was 8%, but no neurological effects occurred (16). Similarly, even in the MACPAF study, which found post-procedural SCLs in over 40% of patients, no abnormal result of neuropsychiatric assessment was detected (38). The most recent AXAFA-AFNET 5 trial also found similar cognitive function between those with and without SCLs (39).These studies also demonstrated that, the majority of acute SCLs (up to 94%) were relatively small, and may resolve spontaneously within a short period of time (40). In addition, SCLs were also found in various cardiovascular interventions, including coronary angiography, valve surgery and coronary artery bypass grafting (41, 42). Therefore, SCLs may occur in various diagnostic and interventional cardiac catheterizations procedures, and the incidence and characteristics of SCLs may differ between different CA techniques, although no significant SCL-related cognitive adverse consequences were reported according to the recent evidence.However, prevention is better than cure. It is crucial that electrophysiologists have an awareness of the factors that increase the risk of SCLs formation and the corresponding techniques for minimizing this risk (6). As mentioned above, the incidence of SCLs may be related to many other factors, such as pre-procedural anticoagulation, mean ACT during the procedure, exchange of catheters, and electrical cardioversion during the procedure. Intraprocedural ACT monitoring is recommended for AF ablation (6). Notably, an ACT level above 300 s during the procedure was associated with a reduced risk of left atrial thrombus detected by intracardiac echocardiography compared with 250–300 s (43). However, in the study using multivariate regression analysis by Wissner et al. (20), an ACT level over 250 s was not a predictor of SCLs on post-procedural MRI. In the present study, the mean ACT during the procedure was 296.4 s for CBA, 349.0 s for HBA, 262.0 s for LBA and 284.5 s for RFA. The mean ACT was comparable between CBA, HBA, LBA and RFA according to NMA and PMA, the relatively longer ACT time during CBA may contribute to its lower risk of SCLs and the highest rank to some extent.Pre-procedural anticoagulation also seems to be an important factor in reducing the risk of SCLs (44). Increasing evidence has showed that continued oral anticoagulation leads to lower incidence of SCLs (22), and the protocol of anticoagulation (rivaroxaban) on the day of the ablation procedure was shown to reduce the incidence of SCLs compared with 24 h-pre-ablation bridging with heparin strategy (22). However, in the present study, it was not possible to compare uninterrupted with discontinued oral anticoagulant strategies due to lack of sufficient evidence. In addition, electrical cardioversion during CA procedure was also reported to increase the risk of SCLs (45). However, results remain controversial, as the study by Gaita et al. (46) found that pharmacologic or electrical cardioversion during the procedure could increase the risk of SCLs to 26%, compared with 9% in the patients who remained in sinus rhythm. In contrast, the study by Wissner et al. (20) failed to detect a significant relationship between SCLs and electrical cardioversion. In the most recent study that investigated the predicting factors of post-procedural SCLs using univariate and multivariate analyses, several patient-related characteristics, such as age and CHA2DS2-VASc score were implicated, whereas, the oral anticoagulant strategy, mean ACT after heparin injection, electrical cardioversion during the procedure and total procedure time were shown not to be positive risk factors (18).Thus, based on the evidence of the present study, SCLs may occur after CA for patients with AF, and may be related to the different ablation techniques used. Though many risk factors for SCLs have been investigated, no consensus has been reached to date. Importantly, a universally accepted definition for SCLs and standard cerebral MRI diagnostic criteria are needed (7).There are several limitations in this study. First, the total number of studies and the sample size included were relatively small; particularly, large-scale clinical trials were rare, which might influence the reliability of our results. Second, the analyses included both PAF and PerAF patients, and also mixed OAC protocols; however, further subgroup analysis could not be performed due to the lack of sufficient data. Third, considerable heterogeneities were detected when analyzing the outcomes such as procedure time; although further sensitive analyses were conducted, the interpretation of these results should still be taken with caution. In addition, the long time interval among the included studies might lead to certain bias, considering that the anticoagulation regimens have undergone changes. Finally, the protocols of the pre- and post-procedure cerebral MRI examinations varied across studies, which may lead to some bias when diagnosing the new SCLs. Nevertheless, our study is the first to provide a comprehensive analysis of SCL occurrence after different balloon-based ablation and RFA techniques for AF, with a scrutiny of all available trials. The results of the present study may provide new evidence, but further multicenter RCTs are still needed to confirm the findings.6ConclusionsCBA treatment was associated with a lower incidence of SCLs on MRI after AF procedure than LBA. Similar post-procedural SCL incidence was found between other ablation techniques, with CBA ranking highest. Total procedure-related complications were also similar between CBA, HBA, LBA and RFA. CBA needed shorter procedure time than LBA. Potential confounders like the scarcity of trials, a heterogeneous AF population, diverse OAC protocols, a lengthy time interval between studies, and varied MRI examination protocols could have affected the observed outcomes to some extent. Thus, further large-scale studies are still needed to improve the robustness of the conclusions."}

However, the long‐term durability of PVI and reconnection patterns following PFA are not as well‐characterized compared to those associated with thermal energy sources such as cryoballoon ablation (CBA) or radiofrequency ablation (RFA). The objective of this study is to compare the durability of lesions resulting from repeat ablation after index PVI using PFA versus thermal ablation (TA).MethodsWe conducted a comprehensive search of multiple databases to identify relevant studies published before January 2025. PVI durability was assessed on a per patient and per vein level.ResultsThis study included 14 trials involving a total of 7,367 patients. PFA demonstrated a trend toward reduced rates of repeat ablation in comparison to TA (OR 0.77; 95% CI, 0.59–1.00). Durability of PVI per patient (OR 1.42; 95% CI, 0.92–2.19) or per vein (OR 1.42; 95% CI, 0.92–2.19) were similar after PFA and TA. The most common site of reconnection was the right inferior PV for both PFA and TA (39.7% and 38.1%, respectively). Subgroup analyses demonstrated that PVI durability per vein was significantly higher with PFA compared to RFA (OR 1.32; 95% CI, 1.03–1.70).ConclusionAt the time of repeat ablation, PFA exhibited a trend toward a reduced incidence of repeat procedures compared to CBA or RFA. PFA is comparable to CBA in achieving durable isolation of all veins but demonstrates superiority over RFA.", "body": "AbbreviationsAFatrial fibrillationATaatrial tachyarrhythmiaCBAcryoballoon ablationLCPVleft common PVLIPVleft inferior PVLSPVleft superior PVPAFparoxysmal AFPFApulsed field ablationPVIpulmonary vein isolationRCTrandomized controlled trialRFAradiofrequency ablationRIPVright inferior PVRSPVright superior PVTAthermal ablation1IntroductionPulmonary vein isolation (PVI) remains the primary objective in atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation [1]. Emerging evidence supporting the efficacy of rhythm control strategies in improving outcomes for AF patients [2], along with recent guideline updates, has resulted in a growing number of patients being referred for this procedure [3]. In recent years, technological advancements have concurrently enabled a comprehensive comparison between established techniques, such as cryoballoon ablation (CBA) [4] single‐shot devices and contact force‐sensing irrigated radiofrequency ablation (RFA) [5] catheters, and novel technologies that are highly effective and well‐tolerated, as recently highlighted in the literature. Pulsed field ablation (PFA) represents an innovative energy modality that induces electroporation with minimal thermal alterations in tissue compared to CBA or RFA, thereby positioning it as a highly promising technique for PVI [6]. Initial safety studies suggest a reduced complication rate associated with PV stenosis, atrioesophageal fistula, and phrenic nerve palsy compared to RFA [7]. The efficacy of this approach is comparable to thermal ablation (TA) strategies for PVI, as demonstrated in the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) examining this issue using time to first recurrence of AF as the primary endpoint [8]. Consistent findings were reported in a recent meta‐analysis encompassing 1880 patients [9].Electrical reconnection of previously isolated PVs remains the most frequently observed phenomenon following PVI procedures, whether conducted using TA or PFA [10, 11]. During repeat procedures, the durability of PVI exhibits considerable variability, with reported estimates ranging from 3% to 53% following TA (Table S1). Incomplete lesion formation during TA is often linked to several factors, including suboptimal low nadir and mean temperatures [12], mismatches between balloon size and patient anatomy [13], insufficient contact force [14], and changes in tissue impedance [15]. For lesion formation using PFA, tissue contact remains crucial, and lesion size is influenced by contact force [16]. However, these patient‐ and application‐specific factors may not be as pertinent to PFA, given that the technology's selective targeting of cardiomyocytes suggests a broader therapeutic window for energy delivery. Therefore, PVI durability may be significantly enhanced during the repeat procedures after PFA compared with TA. However, the available data concerning the durability of PVI are limited, especially when compared to TA. Thus, this study aims to compare the lesion durability on a per vein and per patient level during the repeat procedure after index PFA and TA.2Methods2.1Database Search and Selection CriteriaA systematic search was conducted across the EMBASE, PubMed, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases to identify relevant trials comparing PFA and TA for repeat procedures following an initial ablation for AF, from the inception of these databases until January 2025. The following keywords were utilized: “pulsed field ablation,” “PVI durability,” “cryoballoon ablation,” “radiofrequency ablation,” “thermal ablation,” and “atrial fibrillation.” Furthermore, we conducted a manual review of the references cited in the retrieved articles and examined proceedings from recent major cardiovascular conferences to ensure the inclusion of any relevant studies that might have been overlooked during the initial literature search.The inclusion criteria for eligible studies were as follows: (1) Studies comparing outcomes between patients who underwent a subsequent repeat procedure for recurrent atrial tachyarrhythmia (ATa) after their first PFA and TA (CBA or RFA); (2) Studies that reported relevant results; and (3) Research published in full in the English language. Case reports, case series, nonhuman studies, reviews, and editorials were excluded from this analysis.2.2Data Extraction and Quality AssessmentThe authors independently extracted pertinent data from the eligible studies and achieved consensus on all aspects. Any discrepancies were addressed through discussion and resolved amicably. Extract the following information from each trial: participant characteristics (mean age, proportion of males, coronary artery disease, body mass index, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, transient ischemic attack/stroke, and left ventricular ejection fraction and left atrium diameter) as well as study characteristics (study author, publication year, study population, sample size, intervention strategy, assessment methods, and follow‐up period).The Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool was applied for RCTs, whereas the Newcastle‐Ottawa Scale was used to evaluate the risk of bias in observational studies.2.3Study EndpointsThe primary endpoints of this study included the evaluation of PVI durability and the rate of repeat procedures. PVI durability was assessed at both the per patient level, by determining the proportion of patients achieving complete PVI, and at the per vein level, by quantifying the number of successfully isolated veins. The repeat procedure rate was calculated as the ratio of patients who underwent repeat ablation to the total number of patients who initially received ablation. Secondary endpoints encompassed the incidence rates of individual PV reconnection (right superior PV [RSPV], right inferior PV [RIPV], left superior PV [LSPV], and left inferior PV [LIPV]).2.4Statistical AnalysisThe odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was computed for dichotomous variables. Heterogeneity was evaluated using the Cochrane I2 statistic and categorized as follows: low (I2 ≤ 25%), moderate (I2 > 25% and < 75%), or high (I2 ≥ 75%) [17]. In instances of low heterogeneity, a fixed‐effect model was applied; otherwise, a random‐effects model was utilized. We performed a sensitivity analysis to explore the sources of heterogeneity by sequentially excluding one study at a time. Additionally, we had pre‐planned subgroup analyses based on the type of energy source (CBA or RFA). However, due to the inclusion of only one RCT, conducting subgroup analysis based on study design was not feasible. Visualization results were evaluated through funnel plot symmetry to assess potential publication bias. Statistical significance was established at a two‐tailed P value less than 0.05. All analyses were conducted using RevMan software version 5.3.5.3Results3.1Search Results and Study CharacteristicsThe PRISMA flow diagram offers a systematic overview of the literature selection process (Figure 1). This study ultimately encompassed 14 trials involving a total of 7367 participants (2597 in the PFA group and 4770 in the TA group, which included 65% CBA and 35% RFA) published from 2023 to 2024 [8, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30]. The trials comprised 13 observational studies, including five prospective cohorts [18, 23, 24, 25, 26] and eight retrospective cohorts [19, 20, 21, 22, 27, 28, 29, 30], as well as one RCT [8]. The index procedure baseline characteristics of the included studies are presented in Tables S2 and S3. Among the included studies, four did not provide per patient PVI durability data [18, 22, 24, 30], three failed to report per vein PVI durability data [21, 22, 30], and two only reported redo procedure rates without PVI durability data for either per patient or per vein [22, 30]. Only one study reported the baseline characteristics of patients undergoing repeated ablation procedures in two groups [25].FIGURE 1Flowchart illustrating the study selection process according to the PRISMA guidelines.Regarding the RCT conducted by Reddy et al., [8] it exhibited a low risk of bias in selection (random sequence generation and allocation concealment), performance (blinding of participants and personnel), detection (blinding of outcome assessment), attrition (comparatively complete outcome data), and reporting bias (all prespecified outcomes were reported in accordance with the study protocol) (Table S4). Of the 13 cohort studies, two were rated as moderate quality due to inadequate adjustment for confounding factors [25, 30], while the remaining studies were rated as high quality (Table S5).3.2The Primary EndpointsRepeat ablation procedures are seldom necessary after index PFA (277/2597; 10.7%) or TA (636/4770; 13.3%). Moreover, PFA demonstrated a trend toward reduced rates of repeat ablation procedures in comparison to TA (OR 0.77; 95% CI, 0.59–1.00; p = 0.05; I2 = 59%; Figure 2A).FIGURE 2The forest plot displays the primary endpoints when comparing PFA and TA for atrial fibrillation. (A) the rate of repeat procedures, (B) PVI durability per patient, (C) PVI durability per vein. CI, confidence interval; PFA, pulsed field ablation; PVI, pulmonary vein isolation; TA, thermal ablation.The durability of per patient PVI was comparable between PFA (61/156; 39.1%) and TA (104/345, 30.1%) (OR 1.42; 95% CI, 0.92–2.19; p = 0.12; I2 = 0%; Figure 2B). Similarly, in the per vein analysis, the durability was equivalent for PFA (504/715, 70.5%) and TA (63/169, 65.9%) (OR 1.13; 95% CI, 0.93–1.38; p = 0.22; I2 = 0%;; Figure 2C).3.3The Secondary EndpointsAfter PFA, the RIPV (56/141; 39.7%) was the most frequently reconnected PV, followed by the LSPV (46/139; 33.1%), RSPV (43/141; 30.5%), and LIPV (37/139; 26.6%). After TA, the RIPV (120/315; 38.1%) remained the most frequently reconnected PV, followed by the RSPV (107/315; 34.0%), LSPV (102/306; 33.3%), and LIPV (77/306; 25.2%). No significant differences in reconnection rates were observed between the groups for LSPV (OR 0.90; 95% CI, 0.58–1.40; p = 0.64; I2 = 0%; Figure 3A), LIPV (OR 1.00; 95% CI, 0.62–1.62; p = 0.99; I2 = 1%; Figure 3B), RSPV (OR 0.70; 95% CI, 0.45–1.10; p = 0.12; I2 = 0%; Figure 3C), and RIPV (OR 1.14; 95% CI, 0.60–2.16; p = 0.69; I2 = 44%; Figure 3D).FIGURE 3The forest plot displays the secondary endpoints when comparing PFA and TA for atrial fibrillation.

Additionally, a separate subgroup analysis demonstrated similar results for the PFA group (174/1552; 11.2%) and the RFA group (233/1667; 14.0%) (OR 0.78; 95% CI, 0.59–1.03; p = 0.08; I2 = 31%; Figure S1‐lower panel).PVI durability per patient was observed in 44% (44/100) of the PFA group and 32% (56/175) of the CBA group. However, this difference was not statistically significant (OR 1.35; 95% CI, 0.77–2.34; p = 0.29; I2 = 0%; Figure S2‐upper panel). Similarly, no statistically significant difference in PVI durability per patient was found in another subgroup analysis (PFA: 35.1% vs. RFA: 28.2%; OR 1.53; 95% CI, 0.88–2.69; p = 0.14; I2 = 0%; Figure S2‐lower panel).There was no significant difference in the durability of PVI per vein between the PFA group (415/582; 71.3%) and the CBA group (614/903; 68.0%) (OR 1.02; 95% CI, 0.81–1.30; p = 0.85; I2 = 0%; Figure S3‐upper panel). In contrast, the PFA group (329/475; 69.2%) exhibited a higher rate of PVI durability per vein compared to the RFA group (528/830; 63.6%) (OR 1.32; 95% CI, 1.03–1.70; p = 0.03; I2 = 21%; Figure S3‐lower panel).The reconnection rate of the LSPV did not reach statistical significance in either subgroup (PFA: 32.5% vs. CBA: 25.4%; OR 1.34; 95% CI, 0.72–2.49; p = 0.35; I2 = 0%) (PFA: 33.3% vs. RFA: 39.2%; OR 0.75; 95% CI, 0.45–1.25; p = 0.28; I2 = 0%) (Figure S4A).The reconnection rate of the LIPV was the same in both the PFA group (21/83; 25.3%) and the CBA group (30/130; 23.1%) (OR 1.16; 95% CI, 0.48–2.80; p = 0.74; I2 = 38%), as well as between the PFA group (30/117; 25.6%) and the RFA group (47/176; 26.7%) (OR 0.88; 95% CI, 0.49–1.58; p = 0.67; I2 = 0%) (Figure S4B).For the RSPV, no statistically significant differences were observed in either subgroup (PFA: 24.7% vs. CBA: 32.6%; OR 0.63; 95% CI, 0.34–1.19; p = 0.16; I2 = 0%) (PFA: 31.1% vs. RFA: 35.0%; OR 0.71; 95% CI, 0.42–1.19; p = 0.19; I2 = 0%) (Figure S4C).No statistically significant differences were noted for the RIPV within either subgroup.

The pooled analysis of the aforementioned outcomes was conducted utilizing a random‐effects model to mitigate the potential impacts of inter‐study heterogeneity. Sequential exclusion analysis did not alter the degree of heterogeneity in repeat procedure rates. Consequently, the sensitivity analysis of the sequential exclusions corroborates the robustness of this finding.We identified the study conducted by Rocca et al. [28] as the primary source of heterogeneity in the incidence of RIPV reconnection. After excluding this study, no evidence of heterogeneity was observed (I2 = 0%), and the lack of statistical significance between groups remained unchanged (Figure S5). The heterogeneity may be attributed to the significantly lower frequency of RIPV reconnection among PFA patients in the study by Rocca et al. (p = 0.04) [28].3.6Publication BiasThe funnel plots did not reveal any evidence of publication bias for the selected outcomes of durability of PVI both per patient and per vein (Figure S6).4Discussion4.1Main FindingsTo the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first meta‐analysis comparing outcomes repeat ablation due to recurrent ATa after a first PFA and TA. The principal findings can be summarized as follows:\n1.PFA demonstrated a trend toward a decreased incidence of repeat procedures in comparison to TA.2.Upon repeat ablation, the durability of PVI, assessed both per patient and per vein, was found to be comparable between PFA and TA. Subgroup analyses demonstrated a significant improvement in PVI durability on a per‐vein level in patients treated with PFA compared to those initially treated with RFA.3.The RIPV was the most frequently reconnected PV in both PFA and TA. There were no differences observed in the reconnection rates of individual PVs between the two groups.\nIt is critical to acknowledge that patients undergoing repeat ablation in clinical practice represent a negatively selected population with inherently higher risks of PV reconnection, compared to those systematically remapped in clinical studies. This selection bias may artificially inflate the observed PV reconnection rates in our analysis, as repeat mapping in the included studies was predominantly conducted only in cases of clinical recurrence for both groups. Consequently, the reported PVI durability estimates may not reflect the true success rate in the broader ablation population, particularly among asymptomatic patients. Moreover, 277/2597 PFA patients and 636/4770 TA patients underwent repeat ablation, but the assessments of PVI durability involved only 156 PFA patients and 345 TA patients (the significant reduction in sample size is due to the absence of PVI durability data in the four original studies). The limited sample size may obscure the genuine difference between PFA and TA. Future trials mandating protocol‐driven remapping regardless of symptoms are needed to mitigate this bias.Our analysis indicated that PFA demonstrated a trend toward a lower incidence of repeat procedures relative to TA. Repeat ablation may be more prevalent among patients with a history of coronary artery bypass grafting, a common left PV orifice, non‐paroxysmal AF, arterial hypertension, and advanced age. This is likely due to the higher prevalence of triggers within this patient population [31]. Given the absence of baseline characteristics for patients undergoing repeat ablation, it is not possible to identify predictors of repeat ablation within the scope of this study.PVI durability is the most reliable predictor of freedom from AF recurrence and consequently holds paramount importance in the interventional treatment of AF [32]. For repeat ablation after TA, multicenter RCTs have reported durability rates 10%–30% at the patient level and 46%–64% at the vein level [33, 34], in contrast to rates of 50% at the patient level and 80% at the vein level observed in repeat procedures for all‐comers [35]. Furthermore, multiple observational studies assessing repeat procedures in patients experiencing symptomatic recurrences have demonstrated superior PVI durability for CBA compared to RFA (Table S1). Conversely, the use of the novel non‐thermal PFA device in a premarket study, where all patients underwent mandatory remapping procedures, showed a marked improvement in PVI durability, reaching 84% of patients and 96% of veins [36]. This data indicates that PFA technology is capable of achieving transmural and durable PVI in the majority of patients, thereby significantly enhancing prognosis following AF ablation. However, postmarket durability data after index PFA versus TA in patients experiencing clinical recurrences remain limited.In our study, the durability of ablation per patient and per vein was found to be nearly identical between PFA and CBA. Our findings do not support the initial optimism that PFA integrated into a pentaspline catheter would significantly enhance PVI durability (96%) [36] compared to CBA (80%) [37], as previously reported in two independent studies that included mandatory remapping studies. The latter study also revealed that in patients with paroxysmal AF (PAF) who underwent second‐generation CBA, a reduced number of reconnection gaps were observed [37]. This improvement underscores the ongoing advancements in TA techniques. Similarly, as PFA devices continue to evolve, they may also contribute to enhanced PVI durability. Enhancing operator experience along with technical advancements in the second‐generation pentaspline PFA catheter may potentially lead to a further reduction in PV reconnection. To draw more definitive conclusions, larger multicenter head‐to‐head comparisons between the two single‐shot devices are essential.Regarding RFA, our study demonstrated a substantially higher incidence of PV reconnection when compared to PFA. Although RFA exhibited a higher reconnection rate, no significant difference was observed in the effectiveness of arrhythmia control between treatment groups in clinical practice [8]. This indicates that factors beyond the technical approach itself may significantly influence treatment outcomes. Furthermore, studies utilizing pharmacological induction protocols to systematically map and ablate triggers initiating AF have demonstrated that other sources of ectopic beats can be elicited at a higher frequency in non‐PAF patients. However, these sources still occur in 20%–30% of PAF patients, depending on the specific induction protocol and criteria employed for their identification [38]. Left atrial substrate abnormalities, including low voltage areas, have been documented in approximately 10% of cases [39]. These observations may explain a significant proportion of recurrences due to atrial ectopies originating from extra‐PV sites and abnormal atrial substrates, which can contribute to arrhythmia recurrence and maintenance independently of durable PVI. In conclusion, we posit that establishing whether PFA confers any additional benefits for arrhythmia control will necessitate larger‐scale studies and an arrhythmia monitoring strategy employing implantable loop recorders to more comprehensively elucidate differences in AF control and residual burden.The relatively high incidence of reconnections in the RIPV during CBA and PFA, as compared to other PVs, is likely attributable to anatomical challenges in positioning the ablation devices. Both the cryothermy and pentaspline catheters necessitate the use of a larger, less flexible sheath, which complicates precise placement. This challenge is particularly pronounced if the transseptal puncture is performed too high or too posterior relative to the RIPV, or if the RIPV is located too low relative to an optimal transseptal puncture site [34]. Given that there are no indications of extracardiac injuries such as phrenic nerve palsy or significant esophageal damage associated with PFA, additional applications of PFA can enhance efficacy without compromising safety. Precise placement or repositioning of the catheter and applying additional treatments at the inferior‐anterior aspect of the RIPV may be an effective strategy to improve the durability of PVI.The presence of left common PV (LCPV) has previously been associated with elevated reconnection rates for CBA [40], which may potentially favor the utilization of alternative energy modalities in this anatomical context. PFA using the pentaspline catheter may be limited in overcoming this obstacle due to its single‐shot design, which restricts adaptability to anatomical variations. In contrast, only two of the included studies reported LCPV reconnection rates in our analysis [25, 28]. Specifically, LCPV was reconnected in 4 out of 8 (50%) repeat procedures following PFA, compared to 5 out of 12 (42%) after CBA. Additional and more comprehensive data are required to determine which device may be more effective in treating LCPVs.4.2Comparisons to Previous Meta‐AnalysisPVI durability in protocol‐based and planned remapping studies were comparable after adjustment for patient characteristics in a recent meta‐analysis: PVI durability of at least one PV (per patient analysis) were 70% for PFA, 62% for laser, 54% for CBA, and 46% for RFA, while a per vein analysis revealed durability of 87% for PFA, 84% for laser, 79% for CBA, and 71% for RFA [41]. However, it is important to note that the study was based on a single‐arm meta‐analysis, and the PFA data were derived from only two pre‐commercial trials (both published in 2021) [36, 42]. Conversely, the primary objective of our meta‐analysis was to compare the durability of PVI achieved through PFA versus two classic thermal energy sources, namely CBA and RFA. Furthermore, repeat mapping was primarily performed for clinical recurrence, and not mandated by protocol for the individual studies included in the meta‐analysis. Lastly, our analysis included studies published up to January 2025, ensuring that our findings are consistent with the latest advancements in the field.5Clinical ImplicationsPFA demonstrates potential for lasting PVI. Despite being introduced fewer than 4 years ago, the pentaspline PFA demonstrates a reconnection rate comparable to that of the CBA system, which has been in use for over 15 years. Moreover, it exhibits a superior reconnection rate compared to the RFA system, which has been available for more than two decades and has undergone multiple iterations in catheter design. Experienced operators who had prior exposure to CBA demonstrated superior outcomes in terms of PVI durability, underscoring the significant learning curve associated with over‐the‐wire PVI ablation [43]. Operators without previous experience may encounter a more prolonged learning phase, and comprehensive training is essential for achieving proficiency. Accurate catheter positioning is critical to prevent reconnections; specific attention should be given to the the inferior portion of the RIPV. The introduction of second‐generation PFA catheters integrated with 3D‐EAM promises enhanced catheter placement and improved lesion assessment, potentially leading to better PVI durability. Moreover, the deployment of supplementary applications could constitute an efficacious strategy to augment the durability of PVI. However, further research is imperative to ascertain whether enhanced PFA applications can reduce reconnections without compromising safety.6LimitationsFirst and foremost, only a subset of patients with symptomatic recurrent ATa following PFA or TA‐guided PVI have been investigated. Consequently, the durability of PVI in the entire patient population remains uncertain. Secondly, the pooled analysis should be interpreted with caution, as only one of the 14 eligible trials utilized a randomized design. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that 85% of the included studies were rated as high quality. This composition reflects real‐world experiences and offers generalizability advantages for contemporary practice. Thirdly, the demographic baseline characteristics of patients undergoing re‐ablation were unavailable, precluding the identification of predictors for PVI durability. Similarly, extra‐PV ablation is seldom performed during the initial PVI, limiting our ability to evaluate its durability during subsequent re‐ablation procedures. Additional data are required to adequately assess the durability of extra‐PV lesions. Fourthly, all included studies utilized the FARAPULSE™ system exclusively, and thus their findings cannot be extrapolated to other PFA systems currently available in the market. Each PFA system employs unique waveforms and energy settings, which may lead to varying outcomes. Ultimately, the original study included in the analysis did not consistently perform repeat ablation for all patients with a documented history of recurrent ATa, and the criteria for determining the necessity of reablation varied both within and between participating centers, potentially introducing selection bias.7ConclusionAt the time of repeat ablation following initial PVI using PFA or TA, PFA exhibited a trend toward a reduced incidence of repeat procedures compared to TA. The lesion durability and reconduction rates in individual PVs were found to be comparable, with the exception that PFA exhibited superior durable isolation across all veins compared to RFA. The RIPV is the most frequently reconnected PV.Author ContributionsConcept/design: Yin Zhang. Data analysis/interpretation: Jin‐Cheng Chen, Yin‐Jun Mao. Drafting article: Jin‐Cheng Chen, Yin‐Jun Mao.

Despite their well-established cardiovascular advantages, there is insufficient data to determine how well sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (SGLT2i) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) prevent strokes. The research conducted a systematic review and performed a meta-analysis to assess the comparative effectiveness of SGLT2i versus GLP-1 RAs for preventing stroke incidents in T2DM patients. From 2020 to 2025, the study searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines. Only observational, retrospective, and cohort studies comparing the outcomes of stroke by SGLT2i and GLP-1 RA were included in the study. For risk of bias assessment Newcastle Ottawa Scale (Version 2011) was used. For the meta-analysis, random effects methodology was used to analyze the hazard ratio (HR) with 95% CIs. The study used heterogeneity analysis in conjunction with sensitivity analyses. Eleven studies (with a total of over 500,000 participants) were included. The pooled HR for stroke was 0.92 (95% CI: 0.83-1.02), suggesting that SGLT2i and GLP-1 RA did not significantly differ from one another. Low to moderate heterogeneity was present (I2 = 27.4%). Sensitivity and subgroup analyses validated the findings' robustness. SGLT2i and GLP-1 RAs provided comparable protection against stroke in patients with T2DM. These findings will help clinicians in determining a suitable drug for T2DM patients against stroke.", "body": "Introduction and backgroundType 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) causes a significant cardiovascular risk, including an increased risk of ischemic stroke, as well as an impact on global mortality rates [1]. Even though new diabetes drugs have demonstrated heart-protective properties, research into how antidiabetic medications affect vascular health is ongoing [2]. Based on real-world cohort data and randomized controlled trials, two drug classes that exhibit cardiovascular benefits are sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (SGLT2i) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) [3]. Multiple studies have attempted to compare the efficacy of these agents against stroke, but the final results on preventive measures remain unclear.Although the prevalence of T2DM is increasing, scientists must identify the best pharmacologic approach for preventing stroke due to its catastrophic consequences [4]. Previous studies on cardiovascular effects have primarily used composite endpoints or drug-versus-placebo comparisons, but they do not meet the need for direct comparisons between SGLT2i and GLP-1 RAs in terms of stroke risk [5].This systematic review and meta-analysis examined the efficacy of SGLT2i versus GLP-1 RAs in preventing strokes in type 2 diabetes patients. This research aimed to evaluate the recent real-world data and new large population datasets from the past five years, which together produce the updated knowledge that was necessary for scientific research and clinical management.ReviewMethodologyTo conduct this meta-analysis-related systematic review, the authors adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines [6]. A comprehensive search of medical publications was conducted collaboratively among institutes, mainly at Lady Reading Hospital, Peshawar, India, using the Web of Science, PubMed, and Embase databases to locate studies published between January 2020 and March 2025. The study's methodology combined certain keywords, such as \"SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists\", with \"data on stroke\", \"cerebrovascular events\", and \"type 2 diabetes\". The studies had to use English as the primary language and include human experiments and comparative study design approaches.The selection criteria for the study included observational, retrospective, and cohort studies that directly compared SGLT2i to GLP-1 RAs and produced results related to stroke. According to the research criteria, randomized controlled trials could only be included if they examined the direct comparison of the drugs under study. Studies were excluded if they weren’t based on a direct comparison of both drugs, if they lacked quantitative data, or if they were out of the scope of the study title. Two independent researchers screened titles and abstracts before evaluating full-text studies for eligibility. Data extraction included study design aspects, population information, intervention details, results related to stroke events and follow-up time, and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals. Disputes were settled by consensus.The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (Version 2011) was modified for observational cohorts to assess bias risk in individual studies. The random-effects analysis approach was used because researchers anticipated that study results would differ from one another. As their main analytical focus, researchers compared the stroke HRs of SGLT2i and GLP-1 RA users. The metric for evaluating heterogeneity was the I2 statistic. Distinct subpopulations with pre-existing cardiovascular problems and different observation periods were examined for subgroup analysis. Through sensitivity analysis techniques, the researcher assessed the robustness of the pooled estimate by eliminating studies with maximum and minimum weights [7]. Review Manager (Version 5.3) was used to perform analyses, while the MetaAnalysisOnline tool (Version 2024-2025) validated the results.ResultsThe study comprised 11 relevant studies with data from over 500,000 individuals with type 2 diabetes. The studies that satisfied the inclusion requirements included retrospective and cohort studies that used a time frame of six months to three years to look at different geographic areas of the United States, as well as Europe and Asia. The examined studies compared the use of GLP-1 RA and SGLT2i medications and provided adjusted HRs for stroke outcomes. Figure 1 shows a flow diagram for the screening and selection process.Figure 1PRISMA flow diagram for study selection and screening processPRISMA: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-AnalysesAccording to statistical analysis, the risk of stroke was 0.92 (95% CI: 0.83-1.02) for both medications. This suggests that patients taking both drugs have an equal risk of developing a stroke. The I2 value of 27.4% indicated moderate diversity between studies. Two studies supported GLP-1 RAs, while three studies in the forest plot analysis indicated SGLT2i as the preferred option. The point estimates in this analysis exceeded the null value. The assessment of stroke risk reduction in patients with cardiovascular disease showed that SGLT2i had marginally better results, although statistical significance could not be determined. Techniques for leave-one-out evaluation used across the institute confirmed the combined effect measurement's reliability. The HR value was changed to 0.90 (95% CI: 0.81-1.01) by eliminating one large study (n > 200,000), but this result's statistical significance remained unchanged.The study's findings reveal a situation of clinical uncertainty regarding stroke prevention outcomes for SGLT2i and GLP-1 RAs used for T2DM patients in the general population. Analysis tests show that the study's findings remained consistent and robust across demographic categories. Following selection and screening, the characteristics of the selected research publications are presented in the summarized format illustrated in Table 1.Table 1Summary of included studies comparing the effectiveness of SGLT2i and GLP-1 RAsSGLT2i: sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor; GLP-1 RA: glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist; T2D: type 2 diabetes; CV: cardiovascular; MACE: major adverse cardiovascular events; HF: heart failure; hosp: hospitalization; MI: myocardial infarction; HR: hazard ratio; CI: confidence interval; FU: follow-up; DKA: diabetic ketoacidosis; PS: propensity score; CVD: cardiovascular disease↓ indicates decreasedAuthor (year)Study design and settingPopulation and NIntervention vs. comparatorKey CV outcomes and follow-upDirect conclusionsRisk of bias/assessmentXie et al.

Because cerebrovascular disease globally impacts the population with this condition, it is critical to understand which therapy protects them best. The pooled HR of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.83-1.02) indicated that SGLT2i provided minimally better but statistically insignificant protection against stroke than GLP-1. No statistical difference was found as the confidence interval crossed unity (1.0). Most cohort and retrospective studies provided the same proof [19].The study's variability between research groups was moderate (I2 = 27.4%) due to differences in patient demographics, comorbidities, follow-up periods, and stroke measurement criteria. Retrospective analyses of the United States claims data revealed no drug class superiority between the two groups [20]. Similarities in stroke events were found between the two pharmacological treatment groups in a large multinational observational study based on Scandinavian registries [21]. According to studies conducted on patients with chronic kidney disease, the use of SGLT2i led to a statistically significant decrease in myocardial infarctions and strokes [22]. According to numerous real-world studies, the research findings about the efficacy of SGLT2i and GLP-1 RAs were consistent across Asian and European healthcare systems [23]. Treatment with GLP-1 RAs has anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic effects in addition to SGLT2i-driven blood pressure, body weight, and arterial stiffness management that impacts the risk of cerebrovascular disease [24,25]. Stroke outcomes show similar results across the examined studies, which can be explained by the compensation between drug effects.Although data on stroke risk reduction across various cardiovascular disease patient groups were reported in multiple studies, the findings were not statistically significant [26,27]. The removal of studies with the longest durations and most significant measurements did not affect the overall size effect, confirming the pooled data's reliability. The findings of this analysis were consistent with current diabetes guidelines for drug classes for cardiovascular reduction, allowing healthcare providers to choose between agents to reduce cerebrovascular risk. When selecting treatment options, healthcare providers will prioritize patient concerns about heart failure prevention, renal function maintenance, weight control, and cost-effectiveness. The review satisfied all PRISMA 2020 requirements, but some known flaws could not be concealed by its methodological rigor. Since the included studies did not establish causal relationships, the research was based exclusively on observational study design. Few studies used the incidence of stroke as a primary outcome, but all other confounding variables were undetectable.The results of this study demonstrated that the efficacy of reducing stroke risk between SGLT2i and GLP-1 RAs was similar among patients who had type 2 diabetes. Randomized clinical trials that focus on stroke outcomes need to be conducted to verify these observations while helping practitioners in selecting the best treatment options.ConclusionsThis comprehensive review of medical studies, combined with analysis, determined that the risk of stroke for type 2 diabetes patients was the same for SGLT2i and GLP-1 RAs. In addition to displaying comparable outcomes across various patient groups and a variety of analysis techniques, the gathered data indicates equal clinical protection for the brain vessels.The results of the study were consistent with current treatment protocols, which allow doctors to select drugs based on individual patient history or comorbidities. In order to provide definitive treatment recommendations, more randomized controlled trials with stroke as their primary endpoint are required."}

Mean BP reductions, proportions achieving BP <140/90 mm Hg, and risk of adverse events were summarized using random effects meta-analyses.ResultsTwelve trials (N = 2,581) were included which contributed to 12 comparisons of LDCs vs placebo, 6 for LDCs vs monotherapy, and 4 for LDCs vs usual care. LDC reduced BP by 14/6 mm Hg vs placebo at 4 to 12 weeks, with larger systolic BP reductions at higher pretreatment systolic BP. Compared to monotherapy, LDC reduced BP by 7/6 mm Hg and increased the proportion achieving BP <140/90 mm Hg at first follow-up (67% vs 46%). Compared to usual care, LDC-based care was superior for BP reduction (7/4 mm Hg) and BP control (80% vs 65%) over an average 29 weeks; and results were similar whether patients were initially untreated or on monotherapy. LDC was not associated with significant increase in withdrawals due to adverse events compared to placebo (3% vs 2%), monotherapy (1% vs 0%), or usual care (3% vs 4%).ConclusionsSingle pill LDCs are effective and safe as an initial treatment option for hypertension. The degree of BP reduction depends strongly on pretreatment BP level.", "body": "High blood pressure (BP) remains the leading modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease globally.1 Despite this, only 1 in 3 people with hypertension achieve BP targets <140/90 mm Hg in high-income countries, and <1 in 10 in middle- and low-income countries.2,3 Therefore, there remains a pressing need for better BP-lowering strategies. Emerging evidence indicates that single pill low-dose combinations (LDCs) of 3 or 4 BP-lowering therapies (“hypertension polypills”) could be used as an early treatment strategy for hypertension.4 This concept is based on the rationale that most of the BP-lowering efficacy from an antihypertensive is achieved at a fraction of the full dose and that the BP reductions are additive when using different drug classes.5 Meanwhile, adverse drug effects from antihypertensives appear to be more dose dependent, meaning that the use of multiple low doses to achieve BP control is less likely to induce side effects compared to the common practice of increasing the dose when BP targets are not met. The increase in efficacy from adding another low-dose BP-lowering drug makes LDCs a particularly attractive treatment option that maximizes efficacy while minimizing adverse events.5,6A prior systematic review and meta-analysis including 7 trials demonstrated that LDCs are associated with an average of 18 mm Hg reduction in systolic BP (SBP) compared to placebo and 7 mm Hg reduction in SBP compared to usual care, with a slight increase in dizziness.4 Since then, several new trials of LDCs have been published, allowing more detailed comparisons to address unanswered questions. For example, whether the effects of LDC vary by pretreatment BP is unclear, which is important given recent recommendations to initiate or intensify treatment at lower BP levels in many patients.7,8 There is also uncertainty about how much additional BP lowering is achieved with LDC compared to monotherapy, which remains the most common treatment strategy globally.9,10 Finally, there is debate regarding the timing for use of LDCs in management of hypertension. Specifically, should LDC be used in already treated patients with uncontrolled BP or in the initial stages of treatment, or in both settings? Therefore, we aimed to assess the BP-lowering efficacy and safety of LDC BP-lowering drugs that contain 3 or 4 drug classes compared to placebo, monotherapy, and usual care in randomized clinical trials.MethodsTwo independent reviewers (N.W. and P.R.) performed an updated systematic literature search in PubMed and Medline from the date of the last systematic review in September 2022 until September 2024 to identify randomized controlled trials of hypertension polypills vs placebo, monotherapy, or usual care. Trials were included if they met the following inclusion criteria: 1) randomized clinical trial; 2) compared LDC to placebo, monotherapy, or usual care; and 3) reported data to calculate BP differences between the treatment groups. Abstracts without accompanying full-text publications and trials of combination antihypertensives that did not meet our definition of a hypertension polypill were excluded. We defined a LDC as: 1) 3 or more antihypertensive drugs from the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology 2017 hypertension guideline recommendations for antihypertensive drug classes (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor II blockers, beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, and diuretics); 2) all included antihypertensives at less than 1 standard dose; and 3) contained in a single pill. Standard doses were defined using methods from Bennett et al.11 Two reviewers (N.W. and P.R.) independently reviewed the articles and extracted data on study details and study outcomes. Discrepancies were resolved by review and discussion. Missing SDs of BP were imputed using a stepwise approach as per the Cochrane handbook.12 Authors of the original manuscripts were contacted for key missing data.Study outcomesThe primary outcome was the between-group difference in mean change in clinic SBP. Secondary outcomes were between-group difference in mean change in clinic diastolic BP (DBP), proportion of participants achieving the SBP/DBP target <140/90 mm Hg, and proportion of participants experiencing adverse events, including withdrawals due to adverse effects. We assessed the outcomes at first follow-up visit (between 4 and 12 weeks) between LDC and placebo/monotherapy to obtain the best estimate of the true treatment effect before any treatment escalation or de-escalation occurred. If a trial included a comparator arm with usual care and all patients were on monotherapy at first follow-up, then we included this trial in the comparison of LDC vs monotherapy. We also separately compared the efficacy of LDC vs usual care with physician-directed intensification at the final follow-up visit to confirm whether usual care eventually catches up to an initial LDC strategy in terms of hypertension control.Statistical analysisWe performed a random effects meta-analysis with inverse variance weighting. Binary outcomes were summarized using risk ratios and continuous outcomes using mean difference with 95% CIs. Heterogeneity was assessed using I2 with I2 ≥50% defined as significant heterogeneity. We conducted separate meta-analyses for LDC vs placebo, LDC vs monotherapy, and LDC vs usual care. Subgroup analyses were performed comparing trials with baseline BP <140/90 and ≥140/90 mm Hg, and patients who were on antihypertensive treatment at baseline or those who were untreated. Meta-regression analyses were conducted by including trial level pretreatment BP as a covariate to explain underlying heterogeneity. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials version 2.13 Publication bias was assessed by funnel plots of the difference in mean BP against its standard error, with the ascertainment for potential asymmetry of published results by Egger’s regression test. A 2-tailed P value ≤0.05 was taken to confer statistical significance. Data were analyzed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (version 4) and R (version 5.0, R Project for Statistical Computing). This article involved study-level data and no ethics approval was required.ResultsWe identified a total of 12 randomized clinical trials for inclusion,14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 which contributed to 12 comparisons of LDCs vs placebo, 6 comparisons of LDCs vs monotherapy, and 4 comparisons of LDCs vs usual care. Eight trials involved triple component (3 drug classes) LDC (15, 18-22, 24, 25), while 4 trials used quadruple component (4 drug classes) LDC (14, 16, 17, 23) (Table 1). There was no evidence of publication bias for trials of LDC vs placebo or LDC vs monotherapy (Supplemental Figure 2). There was a total of 2,581 patients included, with mean baseline SBP of 147 (range: 130-160) mm Hg and mean baseline DBP of 90 (range: 84-97) mm Hg.Table 1Characteristics of Included TrialsTrial NameStudy DesignNMean Age (y)Female Sex (%)Proportion Receiving Monotherapy at BaselineLow-Dose Combination ComponentsStandard Dose Options for Low-Dose CombinationFixed or Flexible Combination Pill RegimenbComparator(s)Baseline BP (mm Hg)Time Point for First BP AssessmentTime Point for Final BP Assessment and Adverse EffectsTRIUMPH19Open-label RCT7005658287 (41%)Telmisartan + amlodipine + chlorthalidoneTriple half and triple fullFlexibleUsual care with 99% of patients receiving monotherapy between randomization and first follow-up154/906 wk26 wkQUARTET14Double-blinded RCT5915940273 (46%)Irbesartan + amlodipine + indapamide + bisoprololQuadruple quarterFlexibleUsual care comprising of irbesartan 150 mg as first treatment step153/896 wk52 wkMahmud et al17Open-label RCT10850450Amlodipine + atenolol + bendroflumethiazide + captoprilQuadruple quarterFixedAmlodipine 5 mg or atenolol 50 mg or bendroflumethiazide 2.5 mg or captopril 100 mg160/964 wk4 wkHong et al15Double-blinded RCT24864300Losartan + amlodipine + chlorthalidoneTriple quarter, triple third, and triple halfFixedAmlodipine 5 mg, amlodipine 10 mg, losartan 100 mg, placebo154/924 wk8 wkQuadpill23Double-blinded RCT, crossover2158520Irbesartan + amlodipine + hydrochlorothiazide + atenololQuadruple quarterFixedPlacebo154/904 wk4 wkSung et al18Double-blinded RCT1766135158 (90%)Telmisartan + amlodipine + chlorthalidoneTriple quarter, triple third, and triple halfFixedAmlodipine 5 and 10 mg, losartan 100 mg, placebo151/924 wk4 wkWald et al24Double-blinded RCT, crossover86592686 (100%)Amlodipine + losartan + hydrochlorothiazideTriple halfFixedPlacebo143/86a12 wk12 wkQUARTET USA16Double-blinded RCT62524552 (84%)Candesartan + amlodipine + indapamide bisoprololQuadruple quarterFixedCandesartan 8 mg at first follow-up with option to add amlodipine 5 mg after 6 weeks138/846 wk12 wkRodgers et al22Double-blinded RCT2955156138 (47%)Telmisartan + amlodipine + indapamideTriple quarter and triple halfFixedPlacebo138/864 wk4 wkHAPPY20Double-blinded RCT, factorial1948890Telmisartan + amlodipine + indapamideTriple halfFixedPlacebo131/8712 wk12 wkHAPPY Too21Double-blinded RCT944900Telmisartan + amlodipine + indapamideTriple halfFixedPlacebo130/864 wk4 wkVERONICA25Double-blinded RCT2765154115 (38%)Telmisartan + amlodipine + indapamideTriple halfFlexibleUsual care starting with amlodipine 5 mg or amlodipine 5 mg and losartan 50 mg156/974 wk26 wkRCT = randomized clinical trial.aEnd of placebo treatment BP, baseline BP was not measured; b, describes whether additional antihypertensives could be added after the first follow-up visit.BP-lowering efficacy of low-dose combination therapies vs placeboAmong 7 trials with 12 comparisons of LDC vs placebo, the difference (95% CI) in mean change in SBP between LDC and placebo was −13.5 (−11.8, −15.2) mm Hg, with significant heterogeneity I2 = 77% (Figure 1A). The difference in mean change in SBP reduction was −8.5 (−6.1, −11.0) mm Hg for trials with pretreatment SBP <140 mm Hg compared to −17.7 (−15.4, −20.0) mm Hg for trials with pretreatment SBP ≥140 mm Hg, with a significant interaction between the 2 subgroups (P < 0.001) (Figure 1A). Meta-regression identified a relationship between pretreatment SBP and placebo corrected SBP reduction, with an average 6 mm Hg greater SBP reduction per 10 mm Hg increase in pretreatment SBP (R2 = 1.0; P < 0.001) (Figure 2A).Figure 1Mean Blood Pressure Reduction at First Follow-Up Visit for LDC Vs PlaceboMean BP reduction at the first follow-up visit for LDC vs placebo for (A) SBP and (B) DBP.

Meta-regression showed a trend for greater DBP reduction with higher pretreatment DBP (P = 0.106) (Figure 2B).Compared to placebo, LDC was associated with a 2.4-fold increase in achieving target BP <140/90 mm Hg at first follow-up visit between 4 and 12 weeks (61% vs 27%; RR: 2.42; 95% CI: 1.62-3.62) (Supplemental Figure 3).BP-lowering efficacy of low-dose combinations vs monotherapyAmong 6 trials of LDC vs initial monotherapy, the between-group difference in mean change in SBP was −7.4 (−4.8, −10.1) mm Hg greater at first follow-up visit between 4 and 6 weeks, with significant heterogeneity I2 = 72% (Figure 3). A total of 5 trials reported effects on DBP and LDC conferred a −5.7 (−4.0, −7.4) mm Hg lower DBP compared to monotherapy (Figure 3). Compared to monotherapy, LDC was associated with a 1.5-fold increase in achieving target BP < 140/90 mm Hg at first follow-up visit between 4 and 6 weeks (67% vs 46%; RR: 1.45; 95% CI: 1.34-1.56) (Supplemental Figure 3).Figure 3Mean BP Reduction at First Follow-Up Visit for LDC Vs Monotherapy(A) Systolic blood pressure and (B) Diastolic blood pressure. Abbreviations as in Figure 1.BP-lowering efficacy of initial low-dose combinations vs usual careFour trials compared an initial LDC-based strategy to usual care with physician-directed intensification over a mean follow-up of 29 weeks (range: 12 to 52 weeks).3,16,19,25 Usual care consisted of initial monotherapy in 3 of the 4 trials.14,16,19 Upfront use of LDC achieved significantly greater reductions in SBP at first follow-up visit, which remained superior to usual care at the end of follow-up in 3 of 4 trials (Figure 4). Compared to usual care, LDC was associated with a greater mean (95% CI) difference in SBP and DBP at final follow-up of −7.2 (−5.2, −9.2) mm Hg and −4.0 (−3.3, −4.8) mm Hg, respectively (Supplemental Figure 4). At final follow-up visit, BP control <140/90 mm Hg was achieved in 534/668 (80%) patients randomized to LDC compared to 438/670 (65%) patients randomized to usual care (RR: 1.22; 95% CI: 1.14-1.30) (Supplemental Figure 4). There was no difference in mean difference in (95% CI) SBP according to whether people were treated with antihypertensives at baseline: −6.7 (−3.4, −10.1) mm Hg in those who were untreated at baseline and −5.6 (−3.4, −7.8) mm Hg in participants who were treated at baseline (P value for heterogeneity = 0.570) (Supplemental Figure 4).Figure 4Mean SBP Levels for LDC-Based Care Vs Usual Care With Clinician-Guided Treatment IntensificationRed lines represent low-dose combination therapy, blue represents usual care.

Abbreviations as in Figure 1.Adverse events and tolerabilityOverall, there were low absolute rates of adverse events with LDC, usual care, monotherapy, and placebo (Table 2). LDC was not associated with an excess of treatment withdrawals compared with placebo, monotherapy, or usual care (Table 2). Compared to placebo, LDC had similar proportions experiencing a range of adverse events, including serious adverse events (Table 2). Compared to monotherapy, LDC therapy was associated with a borderline significant increase in individuals reporting dizziness (7% vs 3%; RR: 2.62; 95% CI: 1.00-6.86) but no other adverse events including peripheral edema, headache, musculoskeletal pain, or serious adverse events (Table 2). Compared to usual care, LDC was not associated with any significant increase in adverse events (Table 2).Table 2Adverse Effects and Tolerability for Low-Dose Combination Compared to Placebo or Monotherapy and Usual CareAdverse EventLDC vs PlaceboLDC vs MonotherapyLDC vs Usual CareLDCPlaceboEffect SizeLDCMonotherapyEffect SizeLDCUsual CareEffect Sizen/N (%)n/N (%)RR (95% CI)n/N (%)n/N (%)RR (95% CI)n/N (%)n/N (%)RR (95% CI)Withdrawals due to adverse effect8/235 (3%)3/171 (2%)1.45 (0.14-15.03)1/104 (1%)0/102 (0%)2.94 (0.12, 71.41)27/831 (3%)36/821 (4%)1.03 (0.65, 1.62)Serious adverse event4/345 (1%)3/97 (3%)0.39 (0.09-1.74)2/175 (1%)0/175 (0%)0.83 (0.03, 25.96)36/681 (5%)24/672 (4%)1.45 (0.88, 2.40)Dizziness or symptomatic hypotension19/362 (5%)2/126 (2%)3.67 (1.29-10.42)8/113 (7%)3/112 (3%)2.62 (1.00, 6.86)112/799 (14%)87/791 (11%)1.27 (0.90, 1.80)Headache9/383 (2%)7/145 (5%)0.57 (0.15-2.23)11/184 (6%)10/185 (5%)1.10 (0.84, 1.45)58/799 (7%)56/791 (7%)1.01 (0.71, 1.42)Musculoskeletal pain17/199 (9%)7/132 (5%)2.11 (0.60-7.39)8/184 (4%)6/185 (3%)1.34 (0.65, 2.78)90/831 (11%)93/821 (11%)0.96 (0.74, 1.25)Gastrointestinal discomfort5/1024/531.06 (0.37-3.07)4/80 (5%)3/83 (4%)1.29 (0.38, 4.38)47/681 (7%)42/672 (6%)1.06 (0.72,1.57)Peripheral edema2/240 (1%)0/73 (0%)1.75 (0.19-16.12)1/113 (1%)1/112 (1%)1.08 (0.11,10.38)27/649 (4%)27/642 (4%)0.97 (0.58, 1.63)LDC = low-dose combination; RR = risk ratio.DiscussionThis study evaluated the efficacy and safety of single pill LDCs as an initial or early treatment strategy for high BP. LDCs were superior to placebo, monotherapy, and usual care in reducing BP and improving BP control (Central Illustration). Comparisons with placebo revealed that the degree of BP reduction increased substantially with the extent of BP elevation at baseline, that is, the same initial LDC among people with high baseline SBP will confer a much larger BP reduction than among those with only mildly elevated BP—a form of “autotitration.” LDCs were also well tolerated, with only a small excess of dizziness compared to monotherapy and placebo but no increase in treatment withdrawals due to adverse events.Central IllustrationComparisons of Low-Dose Combinations Vs Placebo, Monotherapy, and Usual CareAbbreviation as in Figure 1.Current guidelines recommend monotherapy or, increasingly, dual combination therapy as the initial treatment option for most people with hypertension and reserve the addition of more drug classes if patients remain uncontrolled on treatment.7,8 LDCs with 3 or 4 different drug classes have the theoretical advantage of increased BP-lowering efficacy with minimal increase in adverse events.5 The BP-lowering effects of different antihypertensive classes are additive and most of the BP-lowering effects occur at low dosage, while the adverse effects are proportional to the dosage of the individual drug components.5,6 The present study expands the evidence basis for the use of LDC for initial or early treatment of hypertension. These results suggest that starting with LDC compared to an initial monotherapy strategy will achieve BP targets in 1.5 times more people at first follow-up visit. LDC remained superior to usual care strategy involving clinician-guided treatment intensification, with 80% of patients achieving BP control at final follow-up compared to 65% of patients in the usual care arm. These findings highlight that standard protocols and treatment approaches with initial monotherapy do not “catch up” to upfront LDC use. Therefore, upfront use of LDCs can simplify treatment and reduce time patients remain with uncontrolled BP, which increases time in target BP and reduces cumulative BP exposure, all metrics strongly associated with less risk of cardiovascular adverse events.26,27The magnitude of BP benefits for LDC was similar irrespective of whether LDCs are used as initial therapy among those untreated at baseline or among those on monotherapy at baseline—these findings therefore call in to question the requirement for separate evidence in these 2 patient populations in some regulatory guidelines.28 We did however observe significant heterogeneity between the trials according to trial level pretreatment BP in terms of BP reduction with LDC compared to placebo. Each 10 mm Hg increase in trial level pretreatment SBP was associated with a 6 mm Hg increase in the mean difference in SBP between LDC and placebo. This phenomenon has been previously described by Wald et al29 and other authors as Wilder’s principle30—pretreatment value determines post-treatment response. Wald et al29 reported a 1 mm Hg increase in SBP reduction for monotherapy for each 10 mm Hg higher trial level pretreatment SBP with monotherapy and a 2 to 3 mm Hg for dual and triple therapy. Our data indicate trial level pretreatment BP has a larger impact on BP efficacy with LDCs. The clinical significance is that LDCs can be expected to be very effective at high BP levels, but at lower starting BP levels, LDCs are less potent. This means LDCs are associated with a small increase in symptoms of hypotension such as dizziness (about 3% to 4% absolute increase in our analyses compared to placebo and monotherapy) but also that higher dose combinations may be needed to reach aggressive BP targets.Study LimitationsFirst, we pooled together trials with different combinations of antihypertensives, which may have partly contributed to the heterogeneity between trials. However, the total standard dose of each LDC did not explain underlying heterogeneity in BP reduction. Some analyses may be underpowered to detect a difference in adverse events and there were differences in follow-up duration between studies. Further studies of LDCs in different patient populations would be important to determine if differences in tolerability exist. This study was not powered to investigate for clinical event reduction, although the relationship between BP reduction and reduction in major cardiovascular events and death is well established.31 Finally, this analysis was pooled using study-level data, and more precise estimates of the relationship between pretreatment BP and expected treatment efficacy may be obtained with individual patient meta-analyses.In conclusion, LDCs in the form of 3 or 4 antihypertensives at less than standard dose are an effective and well-tolerated option for the initial management of hypertension. LDCs offer a “single step” solution that reliably achieves BP target in two-thirds of patients at first follow-up visit and remain superior to usual care that involve clinician-guided uptitration of therapy. Finally, BP reduction with LDCs was associated with trial level pretreatment BP, with greater BP reductions observed in higher grades of hypertension compared to lower or mildly elevated BP.PerspectivesCOMPETENCY IN PATIENT CARE AND CLINICAL SKILLS: In patients with hypertension, low-dose combinations consisting of 3 or 4 antihypertensives each at low dose are well tolerated and associated with significantly greater reductions in BP compared to an initial monotherapy and usual care. The BP reduction of low-dose combinations are highly dependent on their pretreatment BP, with smaller reductions in BP observed in individuals with only mildly elevated BP.TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Future studies should evaluate the efficacy and safety of other combinations of antihypertensives and the use of low-dose combinations as an initial treatment option in different patient populations.Funding support and author disclosuresInstitutional: George Institute Ventures, the social enterprise arm of 10.13039/501100021096The George Institute for Global Health, has received investment to develop fixed-dose combination products, including combinations of blood pressure–lowering drugs.

{"PMCID": "12034885", "title": "Systematic Review of the Effects of Iron on Cardiovascular, Kidney, and Safety Outcomes in Patients With CKD", "abstract": "IntroductionHeart failure and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are closely associated, and iron deficiency is highly prevalent in both conditions. However, major cardiovascular and nephrology guidelines offer contrasting recommendations for iron use. We evaluated the effects of iron versus usual care or placebo on the clinical outcomes in patients with CKD.MethodsWe conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials on i.v. or oral iron in patients with CKD (PROSPERO CRD42023453468). We searched Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Register from database inception until February 1, 2024 to identify eligible trials. We determined the overall results and stratified them by dialysis- and nondialysis-requiring CKD using random effects models, with certainty of evidence assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. The primary composite endpoint was hospitalization for heart failure or cardiovascular death.ResultsWe identified 45 trials that met the inclusion criteria. Compared with usual care or placebo, iron reduced the risk of the primary composite endpoint (1659 events; risk ratio [RR]: 0.84, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.75–0.94; moderate certainty), an effect consistent across dialysis and nondialysis requiring CKD (P-heterogeneity = 0.70). The effect on the primary endpoint appeared driven by both components of hospitalization for heart failure (RR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.61–0.96; moderate certainty) and cardiovascular death (RR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.65–1.02; low certainty). The incidence of serious adverse events was lower for iron compared with usual care or placebo (RR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.82–0.98; moderate certainty; P-heterogeneity = 0.09).ConclusionIron therapy may reduce the risk of heart failure and cardiovascular death in patients with CKD. Randomized trials evaluating the effects of iron on clinical outcomes are needed, especially in nondialysis patients with CKD with or without anemia.", "body": "Iron is an essential trace element with biological roles in hemoglobin synthesis, cellular function, and oxygen transport. Approximately one-third of patients with CKD have relative or absolute iron deficiency,1 both of which are associated with a reduced health-related quality of life, cardiovascular events, and death, independent of anemia.2,3 In patients with advanced CKD, iron deficiency and reduced erythropoietin synthesis are key drivers of anemia. Among patients with kidney failure, iron deficiency and anemia are virtually ubiquitous because of the effects of blood loss and chronic inflammation; chronic inflammation leads to upregulation of hepcidin and diminished intestinal iron absorption as well as sequestration of iron in reticuloendothelial cells.4 Therefore, in patients with dialysis- and nondialysis-requiring CKD, iron is frequently administered to manage anemia and reduce the need for and/or dosing of erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs).In patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction who are iron deficient, multiple randomized, placebo-controlled trials have indicated that i.v. iron administration reduces hospitalization for heart failure and improves functional status and quality of life.5 As a result, clinical practice guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology and other expert scientific statements recommend i.v. iron to improve functional status and clinical outcomes in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction independent of anemia.6 In contrast, kidney disease–focused guideline development groups, including Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes, recommend screening for iron deficiency only when anemia develops, and largely focus on iron therapies as a tool to manage anemia, with CKD trials mostly evaluating effects of iron on hemoglobin concentrations and ESA dosing.7Inconsistent recommendations from widely accepted specialty care guidelines are noteworthy because heart failure and CKD frequently coexist, and the presence of one complicates the management of the other.8,9 The bidirectional relationship between these 2 conditions suggests that iron might reduce the risk of heart failure and/or other cardiovascular events in patients with CKD. In addition to trials on heart failure that included many patients with CKD, several randomized trials of iron therapies in primary CKD populations have been conducted comparing iron versus placebo or usual care, newer versus older generation formulations, i.v. versus oral supplementation, and higher versus lower doses of oral iron. To date, these results have not been systematically evaluated or quantitatively synthesized.Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of iron therapy on the cardiovascular, renal, and safety outcomes in patients with dialysis- and nondialysis requiring CKD.MethodsWe conducted and reported this systematic review and meta-analysis in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses statement, with prospective registration on PROSPERO (CRD42023453468).Search Strategy and Selection CriteriaWe searched Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) from database inception to February 1, 2024 using search terms, including “iron therapies” and related phrases, the names of individual iron compounds, “chronic kidney disease,” “heart failure,” and terms related to randomized controlled trials. The full search strategy, including text words and medical subject headings, is provided in Supplementary Table S1).All randomized controlled trials of adults (aged ≥ 18 years) with CKD comparing the effects of i.v. or oral iron with usual care or placebo on cardiovascular, kidney, and safety outcomes were eligible for inclusion. CKD was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 or an albumin-to-creatinine ratio > 30 mg/g. Because the majority of patients with dialysis-requiring CKD receive regular iron administration as part of their usual care,10 we included trials that evaluated different dosing strategies (e.g,. proactive vs. reactive iron administration) in this population. We also included trials comparing iron-based phosphate binders (i.e., sucroferric oxyhydroxide and ferric citrate coordination complex) with usual care or a placebo. Secondary aims included evaluating the cardiovascular, kidney, and safety outcomes reported from trials that assessed the effects of the following: (i) newer versus older iron formulations, (ii) i.v. versus oral iron, and (iii) higher versus lower doses of oral iron (outside of dialysis-requiring CKD), where data were available. Multiarm trials were included by combining 2 or more arms receiving iron therapies (when the comparison arm was usual care or placebo) or by combining treatment arms based on the generation or dose of the iron therapy (when there was no usual care or placebo arm). Trials that focused on adults who underwent kidney transplantation were included.Data ExtractionTwo authors (BC and AV) independently screened the titles and abstracts of all identified articles and, when indicated, reviewed the full-text reports to identify potentially relevant studies. Any disagreements regarding the eligibility of the studies were discussed and resolved by a third author (BLN). The same 2 authors (BC and AV) independently extracted all data using Covidence systematic review software 2023 (Veritas Health Innovation, Melbourne, Australia) and assessed the risk of bias at the study level using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 1 tool. In addition, we contacted the investigators to request additional unpublished trial data on the key outcomes. Any discrepancies in the data extraction were resolved by the third author (BLN).OutcomesThe primary endpoint was a composite of heart failure hospitalization and cardiovascular death. Other cardiovascular outcomes included hospitalization for heart failure, cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke. Where data were available, we evaluated the effects of iron therapies on kidney outcomes, including changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate, proteinuria, and kidney failure requiring dialysis. In addition, we assessed the incidence of all-cause mortality and serious adverse events.Data Analysis and SynthesisWe prespecified that treatment effects on clinical outcomes were to be quantitatively synthesized using a random effects model to obtain summary treatment effect estimates expressed as relative risks with associated 95% CIs. Our preference was to use hazard ratios from time-to-first-event analyses; however, where these were unavailable, we used the estimated treatment ratios effects obtained from recurrent event analyses. For treatment comparisons in which only the number of events and participants were reported, we calculated and pooled the risk to maximize the information obtained from the trial-level data.We summarized the effects on estimated glomerular filtration rate and proteinuria without conducting inference tests because of substantial heterogeneity in how data on these outcomes were reported (some trials reported values at baseline and follow-up, whereas others reported changes from baseline in each treatment arm), as well as imbalances in baseline values between the active and control arms.Because most patients with dialysis-requiring CKD are routinely administered iron to support erythropoiesis,10 we conducted stratified analyses according to dialysis- and nondialysis-requiring CKD subgroups. Between-study variation was evaluated based on P-heterogeneity values obtained from a random-effects model, with standard chi-square tests for heterogeneity used to assess differences between dialysis- and nondialysis-requiring subgroups.We summarized the certainty of evidence for each outcome using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach based on the following domains: within-study risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, unexplained heterogeneity or inconsistency of results, and imprecision of results.11 Statistical analyses were performed using STATA version 17.0 (StataCorp, 2023).ResultsOur search strategy yielded 2317 records, of which 248 were assessed for eligibility (Supplementary Figure S1). We identified 45 trials that met the inclusion criteria. Overall, 18 and 26 trials enrolled participants with dialysis- and nondialysis-requiring CKD, respectively; and 1 trial enrolled participants from both groups. Five trials studied participants who had heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, where treatment effects in CKD subgroups were reported.12, 13, 14, 15, 16 There were 26 trials that compared the effects of iron versus placebo or usual care,12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 378 trials of i.v. versus oral iron,38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45 9 trials of newer versus older iron formulations,46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54 and 2 trials of higher versus lower oral iron doses.55,56 Ten trials assessed the effects on a primary clinical endpoint, whereas biochemical or surrogate outcomes were the primary focus in 35 trials. Details of trials comparing iron versus usual care or placebo are summarized in Table 1, whereas trials comparing other treatments are summarized in Supplementary Tables S2 to S4.Table 1Characteristics of trials comparing iron therapies vs. usual care or placeboTrialYearParticipants with CKD/total study populationDuration of follow-upPrimary populationInterventionComparatorMean age, yrsFemale (%)Primary outcomeBesarab et al.18200042/426 moHemodialysisi.v. iron dextran (target TSAT > 30%)i.v. iron dextran (target TSAT: 20%–30%)60.840.5ESA dose needed to maintain Hb levelsDRIVE232007134/1346 wksHemodialysisi.v. ferric gluconateUsual care59.949.6Change in HbFAIR-HF122009203/45924 wksHFrEF (NYHA II with LVEF ≤ 40% or NYHA III with LVEF ≤ 45%)i.v. ferric carboxymaltosei.v. saline67.753.2Self-reported PGA and NYHA functional classMcIntyre et al.31200963/635 wksHemodialysisp.o.fermagatep.o. placebo59.128.6Change in serum phosphateCharytan et al.22201397/51330 dHemodialysisi.v. ferric carboxymaltoseUsual care55.933.0Incidence in treatment-emergent adverse events416/513Nondialysis CKD64.567.3Yokoyama et al.36201490/908 wksNondialysis CKDp.o. ferric citratep.o. placebo65.141.9Change in serum phosphateBlock et al.212015149/14912 wksNondialysis CKDp.o. ferric citratep.o. placebo65.066.0Change in TSAT and serum phosphateCONFIRM-HF162015105/30452 wksHFrEF ≤ 45%i.v. ferric carboxymaltosei.v. saline69.246.8Change in 6MWT distanceCRUISE 1 and 2252015599/59948 wksHemodialysisi.v. ferric pyrophosphate citratei.v. standard dialysate58.436.4Mean change in HbPRIME272015103/1039 mosHemodialysisi.v.ferric pyrophosphate citratei.v. standard dialysate59.038.8Change in ESA dose to maintain Hb 9.5–11.5g/dlFloege et al.262015644/64452 wksHemodialysis or peritoneal dialysisp.o. sucroferric oxyhydroxidep.o. sevelamer55.441.5Change in serum phosphateLewis et al.342015441/44152 wksHemodialysis or peritoneal dialysisp.o. ferric citratep.o. calcium acetate and/or sevelamer54.538.8Mean change in serum phosphateFishbane et al.242017233/23324 wksNon-dialysis CKDp.o. ferric citratep.o. placebo65.463.1Proportion of patients with Hb increase ≥1.0 g/dlKoiwa et al.292017213/21312 wksHemodialysisp.o. sucroferric oxyhydroxidep.o. sevelamer60.934.9Change in serum phosphateIguchi et al.28201840/4012 wksNondialysis CKDp.o. ferric citrateUsual care70.162.5Change in serum ferritin, FGF23 and PTHBlock et al.202019203/2039 mosNondialysis CKD (eGFR ≤ 20 ml/min per 1.73 m2)p.o. ferric citrateUsual care62.438.0Change in Hb, TSAT, phosphate, FGF23 and PTHPIVOTAL3020192141/21412.1 yrsHemodialysisi.v. iron sucrose (proactive regimen)i.v.iron sucrose (reactive regimen)62.834.7Composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, heart failure hospitalization, or deathAFFIRM-AHF152020580/110852 wksHFrEF with LVEF < 50%i.v. ferric carboxymaltosei.v. placebo74.547.2Composite of heart failure hospitalization and cardiovascular deathvan den Oever et al.352020200/20013 mosHemodialysisi.v.iron sucroseUsual care68.931.4Median percentage of Hb values in target range (6.8–7.4 mmol/l)Susantitaphong et al.332020200/2006 mosHemodialysisi.v.iron (ferritin target 600–700 ng/ml)i.v. iron (ferritin target 200–400 ng/ml)52.946.5Effect on ESA dose (erythropoietin resistance index)AEGIS-CKD322021167/16752 wksNondialysis CKDp.o. ferric maltolp.o. placebo67.470.1Change in HbZununi Vahed et al.37202160/606 mosHemodialysisi.v. iron (high dose)i.v. iron (low dose)61.240.0ESA dose needed to maintain Hb levels 10–12 g/dlThe Iron and the Heart Study19202154/543 mosNondialysis CKDi.v. ferric derisomaltosei.v. saline59.651.9Change in 6MWT distanceIRONMAN132022730/11372.7 yrsHFrEF with LVEF ≤ 45%i.v. ferric derisomaltoseUsual care73.326.4Composite of heart failure hospitalization and cardiovascular deathHEART-FID1420231553/306512 mosHFrEF with LVEF ≤ 40%i.v.ferric carboxymaltosei.v.placebo68.633.8Hierarchical composite of death and heart failure hospitalization, or change from baseline in 6MWT distanceMAINTAIN-IRON17202379/7912 mosHemodialysisi.v. iron sucrose (high dose)i.v. iron sucrose (low-dose)70.855.7ESA dose needed to maintain Hb of 10–12 g/dl6MWT, 6-minute walk test; CKD, chronic kidney disease; eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate; ESA, erythropoiesis-stimulating agent; FGF23, fibroblast growth factor-23; Hb, hemoglobin; HFrEF, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction; LVEF, left ventricular ejection fraction; NHYA, New York Heart Association Class; PGA, patient global assessment; PTH, parathyroid hormone; TSAT, transferrin saturation.The overall risk of bias was low in the larger event-driven trials in patients with dialysis-requiring CKD and heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction (Supplementary Table S5). However, there was substantial heterogeneity in the risk of bias across the other trials and comparisons (Supplementary Tables S5–S8).Overall, randomization to iron reduced the risk of hospitalization for heart failure or cardiovascular death by 16% (1658 events; RR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.75–0.94; moderate certainty; Figure 1), an effect consistent across dialysis- and nondialysis-requiring CKD subgroups (RR: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.75–0.96 and RR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.64–1.03; P-heterogeneity = 0.73). Risk reductions on the primary composite endpoint appeared driven by both components of hospitalization for heart failure (376 events; RR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.61–0.96; moderate certainty; Figure 2) and cardiovascular death (288 events; RR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.65–1.02; low certainty; Figure 2), with no evidence of heterogeneity across dialysis- and nondialysis-requiring CKD subgroups (both P-heterogeneity > 0.10). For i.v. versus oral iron and newer versus older iron formulations, no clear differences were observed for these outcomes, although data were limited to a small number of trials (Supplementary Figure S2–S3).Figure 1Effect of iron therapies versus usual care or placebo on hospitalization for heart failure or cardiovascular death in people with CKD. ∗First and recurrent hospitalizations for heart failure or cardiovascular death.

CI, confidence interval; CKD, chronic kidney disease; GRADE, Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation; RR, relative risk.In contrast to hospitalizations for heart failure or cardiovascular death, fewer MIs and stroke events were recorded in the included trials. Randomization to iron reduced the risk of MI (187 events; RR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.50–0.88; low certainty; Figure 3), driven entirely by the PIVOTAL trial in dialysis-requiring CKD, with few events in other trials. No clear effect on stroke was observed (74 events; RR: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.58–1.42; very low certainty; Figure 3). There were too few data to reliably assess effects on MI or stroke for i.v. versus oral iron and newer versus older iron formulations (Supplementary Figures S2–S3).Figure 3Effects of iron therapies versus usual care or placebo on (a) myocardial infarction, (b) stroke and (c) kidney failure in people with CKD. CI, confidence interval; CKD, chronic kidney disease; GRADE, Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation; RR, relative risk.In patients with nondialysis-requiring CKD, randomization to ferric citrate coordination complex reduced the risk of kidney failure based on data from 1 trial (63 events; RR: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.32–0.71; very low certainty; Figure 3). Generally, no effects on estimated glomerular filtration rate or proteinuria were observed with iron versus usual care or placebo; however, heterogeneity in data presentation and imbalances between treatment arms precluded quantitative synthesis (Supplementary Tables S9 and S12). For other comparisons, there were few reports on kidney outcomes (Supplementary Figure S2 and Tables S10–S16).Randomization to iron reduced the risk of all-cause mortality (765 events; RR: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.74–0.98; low certainty; Figure 4), driven largely again by the PIVOTAL trial in dialysis-requiring CKD, although no statistical evidence of heterogeneity was observed across dialysis- and nondialysis-requiring CKD subgroups (P-heterogeneity= 0.52). Fewer serious adverse events were observed with iron compared to usual care or placebo (2562 events, RR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.82–0.98; moderate certainty; P-heterogeneity across CKD subgroups = 0.09; Figure 5). There were too few data to reliably assess effects on mortality and serious adverse events for high versus low-dose iron products (Supplementary Figure S4).Figure 4Effect of iron therapies versus usual care or placebo on all-cause mortality in people with CKD. CI, confidence interval; CKD, chronic kidney disease; GRADE, Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation; RR, relative risk.Figure 5Effect of iron therapies vs. usual care or placebo on serious adverse events in people with CKD. CI, confidence interval; CKD, chronic kidney disease; GRADE, Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation; RR, relative risk.DiscussionIn this systematic review and meta-analysis, we observed that iron therapies reduced the risk of hospitalization for heart failure or cardiovascular death compared with placebo or usual care, with consistent effects in patients with dialysis- and nondialysis-requiring CKD. Although iron appeared to reduce the risk of MI, kidney failure, and all-cause mortality, the effects were imprecise or uncertain, often driven by a single trial not powered for these endpoints, and with very limited, if any, data on nondialysis-requiring CKD. For the comparisons of i.v. versus oral iron, newer versus older iron formulations, and higher versus lower oral iron doses, the lack of data precluded our ability to draw reliable inferences about their effects on cardiovascular events. Taken together, these data suggest that iron may yield beneficial cardiovascular effects in patients with CKD, particularly in those with heart failure; however, dedicated clinical trials of iron in patients with nondialysis-requiring CKD, with and without heart failure, are needed to guide clinical practice.We should emphasize the fact that many of the trials included in our systematic review enrolled patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction; however, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction is the predominant form of heart failure in patients with CKD.57 To date, there are very limited data on the effects of i.v. iron on functional and clinical outcomes in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, with data limited to a single trial of 39 participants.58In contrast to trials testing the effects of iron administration in heart failure (where we examined results in the CKD subgroup), only a single dedicated CKD trial, PIVOTAL,30 was designed to evaluate the effects of iron on cardiovascular outcomes, though these outcomes were consistently identified as a priority for patients and their caregivers.59 Instead, CKD trials focused almost exclusively on correction of anemia and changes in ESA dosing. These trials were largely motivated by concerns about ESA safety in nondialysis-requiring CKD and economic considerations.60,61 The reduction in MI, driven largely by the PIVOTAL trial, raises the possibility that the cardiovascular benefits of iron in CKD may extend beyond reductions in heart failure and related events. However, without adequately powered cardiovascular outcome trials in patients with nondialysis CKD, its effects on MI or stroke remain uncertain.Currently, there is a clear distinction in the recommendations of cardiology and nephrology clinical practice guidelines regarding the use of iron therapies. The European Society of Cardiology heart failure guidelines recommend i.v. iron in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction who are iron deficient, to improve quality of life and to reduce the risk of hospitalization for heart failure.6 In contrast, the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes 2012 guidelines for the management of anemia in CKD recommend a trial of iron (i.v. or oral) to increase hemoglobin without starting an ESA or to reduce the dose of ESA required to maintain hemoglobin concentrations and mitigate the need for red blood cell transfusions,7 with a similar approach outlined in the 2025 update. However, trials in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction have indicated that the benefits of heart failure outcomes are independent of anemia.5Our findings suggest that reconsidering the current recommendations on the use of iron in CKD might be appropriate and allow more patients to benefit from therapy with a favorable benefit-risk profile. A multinational study of almost 7000 patients across North America, Brazil, and Europe identified significant undertreatment of iron deficiency in patients with CKD, even among those with anemia.1The lower incidence of serious adverse events with iron therapies versus usual care or placebo is reassuring, especially in patients with kidney failure, where there has previously been concerns about increased risk of infection and thrombosis.62 However, long-term safety data are lacking, because only 5 of the 17 studies evaluating serious adverse events had a follow-up duration of at least 12 months.15,26,30,32,34 In contrast, when comparing i.v. versus oral iron therapies, there was a marginally higher incidence of serious adverse events associated with i.v. iron. This was driven by 2 studies (FIND-CKD and REVOKE) which had longer follow-up periods (56 weeks and 24 months, respectively) than the other trials.38,42 These results emphasize the need for trials with repeated dosing of iron therapies to evaluate long-term efficacy and safety. Small trials, not specifically conducted in CKD, have suggested that newer iron formulations may be superior to older formulations with respect to safety63; however, we found no evidence that serious adverse events differed between i.v. versus oral iron and newer versus older iron formulations. Nevertheless, the overall safety profile of iron supports the feasibility of placebo-controlled outcome trials of iron therapies for CKD, designed to evaluate their effects on clinical outcomes.Although the available evidence suggests a potential role of iron therapies in reducing risk of worsening heart failure in CKD, this comes with the caveat that almost all the data for this outcome were derived from trials of patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Thus, it is difficult to determine whether these effects are driven by the presence of heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction rather than by CKD. Although there were few available data on kidney outcomes, the finding that ferric citrate coordination complex (compared with usual care) reduced the need for dialysis in a single phase 2 trial raises the possibility that iron therapies may slow the progression of kidney disease, or ameliorate signs or symptoms of uremia (or heart failure) that might prompt dialysis initiation.20 These data, and the uncertainty they highlight, underscores the need for adequately powered randomized trials evaluating the effects of iron on functional status, health-related quality of life and clinical outcomes in patients with nondialysis-requiring CKD, with or without anemia. Indeed, the draft Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes 2025 Clinical Practice Guideline For Anemia in CKD highlights that “adequately powered pragmatic randomized controlled trials are needed to assess the benefits, harms, and costs of a proactive high dose i.v. iron regimen—in people with CKD not receiving dialysis.”This study benefits from a prespecified, comprehensive, and systematic approach to the quantitative synthesis and interpretation of many randomized trials. The data were evaluated for multiple treatment comparisons. However, this study has some important limitations. This was a 2-stage tabular meta-analysis using mostly published data; thus, we were unable to assess treatment interactions across important subgroups such as those based on transferrin saturation, serum ferritin, or hemoglobin. Aside the large event-driven outcome trials, cardiovascular events were generally not independently adjudicated, which may be particularly relevant given the clinical overlap between heart failure and CKD progression. Data for some iron products, such as ferric derisomaltose, were available only for the primary outcomes. Limited data on MI, stroke, and CKD progression are reflected in imprecise treatment effect estimates and limited our ability to test for heterogeneity across the dialysis- and nondialysis-requiring CKD subgroups. Considering these limitations, our findings provide the most comprehensive assessment of the therapeutic landscape for iron therapies in CKD and underscore the need for randomized, placebo-controlled outcome trials in patients with CKD, especially those not on dialysis.In summary, iron therapies may reduce the risk of hospitalization because of heart failure or cardiovascular death in patients with CKD. Randomized trials evaluating the effects of iron on clinical outcomes are warranted, especially in nondialysis patients with CKD with or without anemia.DisclosureSVB reports consulting fees from Bayer, AstraZeneca, GSK, and Vifor Pharma; speaking fees from Bayer, AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Vifor Pharma (all honoraria paid to his institution); and nonfinancial research support from Bayer.

{"PMCID": "12066946", "title": "Survival benefit of secondary prevention medical therapy in takotsubo cardiomyopathy: a Bayesian network meta-analysis", "abstract": "AbstractAimsTakotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC) is a form of transient left ventricular systolic dysfunction without evidence of complicated coronary artery disease. Efficacy of medical therapy in secondary prevention of all-cause mortality is not well established. We performed a systematic review and network meta-analysis to compare survival benefit of secondary prevention medical therapy in patients with TTC.Methods and resultsPubMed, Embase, and Cochrane were searched up to 6 January 2024. Eligible studies included multivariable-adjusted or propensity-matched studies of patients receiving medical therapy with beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), aspirin, and statins after an index presentation with TTC. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at any time point. Secondary outcome was TTC recurrence. Random-effect hierarchical Bayesian meta-analysis was performed. We identified 13 observational studies. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy mortality was reported in 435 (4.7%) out of 9237 patients, across a median follow-up of 2.18 years. Mean age was 69.7 ± 12.5 years, and 7906 patients (90.7%) were females. Beta-blockers were associated with a statistically significant reduction in mortality compared to control [hazard ratio (HR) 0.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.55–0.77)]. ACE inhibitors/ARBs showed a nonsignificant trend towards mortality reduction [HR 0.76, 95% CI (0.54–1.07)]. Statins [HR 0.96, 95% CI (0.77–1.19)] and aspirin [HR 0.87, 95% CI (0.55–1.38)] showed no significant mortality benefit. Bayesian probability ranks favoured beta-blockers as the most effective treatment for TTC mortality prevention.ConclusionThis review highlights the modest efficacy of secondary prevention medications in the management of TTC, as ACE or ARBs, beta-blockers, aspirin, and statins failed to demonstrate comparative mortality benefit. Randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm efficacy of pharmacotherapy in this vulnerable patient cohort.", "body": "IntroductionTakotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC), also known as stress cardiomyopathy, is a heterogeneous acute cardiac syndrome characterized by transient left ventricular systolic dysfunction.1–4 Takotsubo cardiomyopathy often presents similarly to acute coronary syndrome (ACS) yet occurs in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) or acute plaque rupture.5–7 Historically believed be a benign disease, studies have shown that TTC has morbidity and mortality rates that are comparable to those of ACS, based on inconsistent data.8–13 Higher mortality rates are often observed in secondary forms of TTC, which are typically precipitated by acute medical stressors such as sepsis or surgery.14,15Based on conflicting observational data and early mechanistic studies, contemporary guidelines recommend careful initiation of pharmacotherapy where significant predictors of ‘severe TTC’ are present; left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of <35%, significant LVOTO gradients (>40 mmHg), suspected bystander coronary artery disease, normal-high systemic vascular resistance and complicating tachyarrhythmia.11 Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been associated with improved survival at 1-year after propensity matching, while beta-blockers have demonstrated inconsistent results.12 In a large observational study based on the InterTAK registry, one-third of patients on post-discharge beta-blockers experienced TTC recurrence.12 ACE or ARBs have been associated with inconsistent TTC recurrence rates, and a recent meta-analysis found no benefit for combination ACE or ARB and beta-blocker therapy in reduction of TTC recurrence.16 Furthermore, the mortality benefit for aspirin and statins is also uncertain,17 and currently these medications are only recommended if concomitant severe coronary artery disease is also present.11To date, no randomized controlled trials have been conducted to establish the optimal management strategy for patients with TTC,11 and current guidelines are based on an inconsistent sample of observational data. We therefore performed a systematic review and network meta-analysis to consolidate the existing evidence, and to determine the relative survival benefit of secondary prevention medical therapy (ACE or ARBs, beta-blockers, aspirin, and statin) in TTC patients.MethodsThis systematic review and meta-analysis is reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) statement guidelines.18,19 This review is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024600925) and did not require institutional board review.Search strategyA comprehensive search strategy was designed and conducted using PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases from inception to 6 January 2024. We manually searched the references cited in the previous reviews and other important studies related to this subject. We did not need to contact the corresponding authors of the studies, as the relevant information was easily accessible from the original studies. We trialled the following search terms in varying combinations:(‘Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy’ OR ‘Takotsubo Syndrome’ OR ‘TTS’ OR ‘apical ballooning syndrome’ OR ‘broken heart syndrome’ OR ‘stress cardiomyopathy’) AND (‘Prognosis’ OR ‘Recurrence’ OR ‘Mortality’ OR ‘Survival’ OR ‘Pharm*’).The detailed search strategy, search terms used, and inclusion and exclusion criteria are provided in the supplementary materials.Study eligibilityWe included all multivariable-adjusted or propensity-matched studies with patients receiving medical therapy with ACE or ARB, beta-blockers (BB), aspirin, and statins as discharge pharmacotherapy after an index presentation with TTC, and provided risk estimates or incidence for all-cause mortality. Studies were included if they enrolled patients consistent with but not limited to the Takotsubo Italian Network (TIN) register, Heart Failure Association, European Society of Cardiology, or InterTAK TTC diagnostic criteria.5 We also excluded review articles, abstracts without full text available, and studies not in English. No minimum follow-up time was specified.OutcomesThe primary outcome was all-cause mortality at any time point. Outcome definitions according to original studies are detailed in supplementary materials.Data extraction and quality assessmentTwo reviewers (A.Z. and D.M.) screened all the titles and abstracts independently. This was performed with a free-to-use web application (Rayyan, Qatar Computing Research Institute, Ar-Rayyan, Qatar). Conflicts were resolved by inclusion of a third reviewer (N.M.). This process was followed by the full text review of the selected articles by the two independent reviewers (A.Z. and D.M.). We then extracted the data from selected studies using a standardized, pilot-tested extraction template. Data were extracted by two independent reviewers (A.Z. and D.M.), and conflicts were resolved through discussion or a third reviewer (N.M.). Reviewers extracted the data with regard to inclusion criteria, total number of patients, duration of follow-up, pharmacological treatment at the moment of discharge, during follow-up, and at the time of TTC all-cause mortality and TTC recurrence. We did not need to contact authors for missing data. Two reviewers (D.M. and A.Z.) assessed quality of included studies by using the ROBINS-I tool.20 Disagreements between reviewers for classifications were resolved by consensus.Statistical analysisA hierarchical Bayesian network meta-analysis was conducted using R, utilizing a random effects model due to heterogeneity in population sample size and baseline demographics. Bayesian network was utilized over a frequentist model to synthesize evidence from heterogeneous observational studies, as it allows for the integration of prior information and the generation of posterior probabilities, which enhance the assessment of relative treatment effects.21 This method facilitates the estimation of both direct and indirect comparisons, which is particularly relevant for TTC where there is no direct RCT comparison of treatments.11 Additionally, Bayesian approaches offer probabilistic treatment rankings that improve interpretability, compared to frequentist methods, which can be more sensitive to sample size constraints and less effective in managing complex correlation structures.22 Mortality rates and multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios were extracted for both case (TTC patients receiving medical therapies) and control (TTC patients not receiving medication). Results are reported as hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using random effects model for direct comparisons among ACE or ARB, beta-blockers, aspirin, and statins, and adjusted hazard ratios were pooled for comparison with control, with statistical significance set at P < 0.05. The network graph was designed with node sizes proportional to the number of participants in each intervention and line thickness proportional to the number of studies comparing each treatment arm. Forest plots for the analysed outcomes and the network graph were obtained, illustrating HRs and 95% CIs for the direct comparisons among the five interventions (including control). Heterogeneity among studies was assessed using the I² statistic. A Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking (SUCRA) table was generated to rank treatments based on their effectiveness in the secondary prevention of TTC. A SUCRA of 90% means that the treatment of interest achieves 90% of effectiveness or safety relative to other interventions. Thus, the larger the SUCRA value, the higher the rank of the treatment, indicating a safer or more effective treatment.ResultsSearch resultsThe literature search yielded 2502 unique studies after removal of duplicates, and 13 studies were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis (see Figure 1). Detailed rationale for exclusion of full-text studies is provided in the Supplementary material.Figure 1Study assessment and inclusion flowchart.Characteristics of included studiesA total of 13 observational studies were included in this systematic review,17,23–34 including 9237 patients. The weighted median follow-up time was 2.2 years. The Takotsubo Italian Network (TIN) was the most frequently used database, appearing in two studies with the same time frame (January 2007 to December 2018),33,34 suggesting potential overlap and duplication of patient data. Of the two studies, only data from Silverio et al.33 were included in meta-analysis. Other registries included the InterTAK registry, Mayo Clinic Registry, Kaiser Permanente Southern California Health System (2006–16), and the Spanish National Registry (RETAKO) (January 2003 to July 2018). The included studies employed varying definitions for TTC, largely aligning with established diagnostic criteria from European Society of Cardiology11 and INTERTAK.12 Almendro-Delia et al.23 used a modified version of the Mayo Clinic criteria, emphasizing transient wall motion abnormalities beyond a single coronary distribution. Cacciotti et al.,24 D'Ascenzo et al.,17 and Elesber et al.26 described TTC based on transient apical or basal wall motion abnormalities extending beyond a single epicardial coronary territory. Citro 201825 and Lau et al.29 focused on typical acute presentations involving dyskinesis or akinesis, primarily affecting the apical segments of the left ventricle. Gopalakrishnan et al.27 defined TTC by transient severe hypokinesis, akinesis, or dyskinesis unrelated to a single coronary distribution, often with stressor-related triggers. The remainder of studies defined TTC according to the INTERTAK registry definition. One study did not use coronary angiogram in the diagnostic algorithm for TTC.17 Two studies utilized cardiac MRI in the routine diagnostic algorithm.24,29 The weighted mean average mortality rate across the included studies was 4.7%, with 435 patients who died across the included studies. The weighted average recurrence rate across the included studies was ∼3.10%. Of these, 5511 patients (56.59%) were discharged on ACE or ARBs, while 5981 patients (61.47%) received beta-blockers at discharge. Aspirin was prescribed to 4448 patients (45.68%), and statins were given to 2395 patients (24.61%) upon discharge.

The average age was 69.7 ± 12.5 years. Among included studies, 7906 (90.36%) were female. Anatomical variants were reported in only one study.24 A total of 1026 patients (34.39%) experienced a physical stressor preceding their admission with TTC. Of the included patients, 23.1% had known coronary artery disease, 17.9% had diabetes mellitus, 44.8% had dyslipidaemia, and 65.8% had hypertension. The average LVEF across all studies was 41.12% (±10.54%), and the average QTc was 489.33 ms (±51.75 ms). The total number of patients with LVOTO was 11 (0.11%). Detailed baseline characteristics are provided in the supplementary materials.Methodological quality and risk of biasThe methodological quality of the included studies was generally moderate, as assessed by the ROBINS-I tool. Across the 13 studies, the overall risk of bias was consistently rated as moderate, primarily due to the observational nature of the designs, which inherently carried risks of confounding and missing data. The domain most frequently associated with higher bias was confounding, present in all studies. This was attributed to the diverse patient populations, varying management strategies, and differences in healthcare settings. Despite adjustment efforts, unmeasured or residual confounding persisted, particularly in multicentre registry-based studies like Almendro-Delia et al.23 and Raposeiras-Roubín et al.32 where local practice variations contributed to bias. Additionally, bias due to missing data was common across all studies, with many not clearly specifying strategies for managing missing outcomes, especially in those with longer follow-up periods. Conversely, bias in selection of participants, classification of interventions, measurement of outcomes, and selection of reported results were generally low. Most studies used clear inclusion criteria, consistent intervention definitions, and objective outcomes like mortality and recurrence rates, reducing bias. Moreover, adherence to predefined protocols minimized selective reporting. Among the studies, Almendro-Delia et al.23 and D'Ascenzo et al.17 exhibited relatively higher bias, particularly due to confounding and inconsistent handling of missing data. These studies, often based on larger multicentre registries or cohort analyses, faced issues with data completeness and selection bias. In contrast, studies like Kim et al.28 and Silverio et al.33 showed lower bias within the moderate range, due to advanced statistical analysis and adjustment of confounders. A detailed risk of bias summary is provided in the supplementary materials.Association of outcomes with secondary prevention medication according to the Bayesian approachACE/ARB treatment showed a reduction in mortality risk compared to control [HR = 0.76, 95% CI (0.54–1.07)]. However, this was not statistically significant. BB therapy was associated with a significantly lower risk of all-cause mortality compared to control [HR = 0.65, 95% CI (0.55–0.77)]. Statin therapy did not show a significant difference in mortality risk compared to control [HR = 0.96, 95% CI (0.77–1.19)]. Aspirin use was associated with a nonsignificant trend towards reduced mortality [HR = 0.87, 95% CI (0.55–1.38)]. BB vs. statins [HR = 0.87, 95% CI (0.43–1.78)] and BB vs. aspirin [HR = 1.02, 95% CI (0.47–2.23)] indicated no significant differences. Figure 2 displays a summary forest plot comparing treatment arms [ACE/ARB, beta-blocker (BB), aspirin, statin] with hazard ratio (HR, 95% CIs) for all-cause mortality. A graphical representation of the association of secondary prevention medication with TTC mortality and recurrence is displayed in Figure 3. The league table is shown in Table 2.Figure 2Forest plot comparing treatment arms [ACE/ARB, beta-blocker (BB), aspirin, statin] with hazard ratio (HR, 95% confidence intervals) for all-cause mortality.Figure 3Network diagram comparing survival benefit of medical therapy in takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ACE/ARB), aspirin, statins, beta-blockers, and control (no pharmacotherapy) are represented as nodes. The size of each node reflects the number of patients who received that treatment across the included studies. Lines between nodes represent direct comparisons between two treatments, with the width proportional to the number of contributing studies. Arrows indicate the direction of comparison, pointing from the reference treatment to the comparator. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are displayed on the arrows and reflect the relative hazard of mortality for the comparator compared to the reference treatment. For example, the arrow from ACE/ARB to beta-blockers displays an HR of 0.86 [95% CI (0.48–1.51)], indicating that, in the studies that directly compared these two treatments, patients who received beta-blockers had a numerically lower—but not statistically significant—hazard of mortality compared to those who received ACE/ARB therapy. An HR < 1.0 favours the comparator (in this case, beta-blockers), while an HR > 1.0 would favour the reference treatment. The absence of a connecting line between two nodes indicates that no direct comparison was available in the included studies.Table 2League table comparing survival benefit of medical therapy in takotsubo cardiomyopathy\n\nThe table presents hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each pairwise comparison of medical therapies. Each row defines the reference treatment, and each column the comparator. A hazard ratio (HR) < 1 suggests lower hazard of mortality with the row treatment compared to the column treatment; an HR > 1 favours the column treatment. For example, in the row for beta-blockers, the comparison with control indicates a hazard ratio of 0.65 [95% CI (0.55–0.77)], suggesting a lower mortality risk associated with beta-blockers.The probabilities of each treatment being ranked from most to least effective (Rank 1 to Rank 4) were analysed alongside the Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking (SUCRA) values. ACE/ARBs showed a 14% probability of being the most effective treatment, a 27% probability for both the second and fourth most effective, and a 32% probability for the third most effective, with a SUCRA value of 42.97. Aspirin had a 23% probability of being the most effective, 22% for second, 19% for third, and 36% for fourth, resulting in a SUCRA of 44.02. Beta-Blockers displayed a 17% chance of being ranked first, 28% second, 33% third, and 22% fourth, with a SUCRA of 47.14. Statins were found to be the most favourable treatment with a 45% probability of being the most effective, 23% for second, 17% for third, and 15% for fourth, accompanied by the highest SUCRA value of 65.87. Rankograms and SUCRA values are detailed in Table 3.Table 3Rankogram and SUCRA values\n\nThe table presents the probability of each treatment being ranked from first (most effective) to fourth (least effective) for mortality reduction, along with the Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking curve (SUCRA) values. Each row corresponds to a treatment, and columns indicate the probability of occupying each rank. SUCRA values summarize these probabilities into a single metric ranging from 0% to 100%, where higher values indicate a greater likelihood of being among the more effective treatments. A SUCRA of 90% implies that a treatment achieves 90% of the maximum possible effectiveness relative to others.DiscussionThe present study of 9237 patients found that:Rate of TTC mortality and recurrence is 4.7% and 3.10%, respectively, at average 2.2 years follow-up.Single-drug therapy with beta-blockers (BB) was associated with 35% reduction in TTC mortality, but failed to demonstrate significant incremental survival benefit on comparison with ACE/ARB, aspirin, and statin.Single-drug therapy with ACE/ARB, aspirin, or statin was not associated with reduction of TTC mortality, and no medications demonstrated significant incremental improvement in direct comparison.There is not sufficient statistical evidence regarding therapy with secondary prevention medical therapy in reduction of TTC mortality.This meta-analysis evaluated the association between secondary prevention therapies (ACE/ARB, beta-blockers, aspirin, and statins) and all-cause mortality in TTC patients. Recent studies have shown that TTC has morbidity and mortality rates that are comparable to those of ACS, with ∼40% of all long-term death in these patients related specifically to TTC-related complications.8–13 The rate of TTC mortality reported in our pooled study (4.7%) was consistent with the International Takotsubo Registry12 and previous meta-analyses.8 Previous studies have investigated the association between medical therapy and TTC recurrence, and found no significant reduction in TTC recurrence with ACE/ARB, BB, the combination of both medications, and no incremental reduction in TTC recurrence after direct comparison.16,35 Prior meta-analyses evaluating survival benefit have faced various limitations: excluding patients from the International Takotsubo Registry, inclusion of unadjusted observational studies, and pooling of distinct risk estimates.12,36,37 Pooled analyses have reported a medication distribution at index admission for BB of 66.8% and ACE/ARB of 67.4%, and the International Takotsubo Registry reports on admission, 32.5% of the patients were taking BB and 37.9% were taking either ACE/ARB, which increased at discharge to 78.1% and 79.3%, respectively. This is complemented by the results from the current study, which reported 61.47% for BB and 56.59% for ACE/ARB on discharge. The distribution of patients discharged on aspirin or statins is more inconsistent, however the presence of concomitant CAD in TTC patients has been reported to be 10–12%, which is less than that of the current review (23.1%). Thus, the novelty of our study is that it (i) evaluates the association of medical therapy with TTC mortality, which is especially pertinent given the comparable mortality rates to ACS,8 as well as similar observed incidence to TTC recurrence,16,38 (ii) includes a larger sample size than previous meta-analyses, (iii) employs hierarchical Bayesian network meta-analysis, evaluating the relative, incremental mortality benefit of medical therapies while incorporating prior probabilities and generating posterior distributions, and (iv) employed SUCRA rankograms to provide a probabilistic estimation of treatment effectiveness, improving interpretability of the findings.22Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockersACE/ARBs have been hypothesized to reduce mortality in TTC by attenuating sympathetic overactivity and reducing afterload, which are critical contributors to ventricular stress and myocardial stunning observed in TTC​.5 The potential benefit of ACE inhibitors is thought to arise from their capacity to mitigate the effects of excessive catecholamine release on the myocardium, which includes reducing myocardial oxygen demand and improving endothelial function, as well as slowing the progression to LV dysfunction by improving ventricular remodelling and reducing myocardial fibrosis.5,39 Mechanistic studies supporting the use of ACE inhibitors in TTC postulate an improvement in coronary microvascular function, which is often impaired in TTC patients due to endothelial dysfunction and microvascular spasm triggered by catecholamine excess.39 In our study, although ACE/ARB therapy was associated with a reduction in mortality risk [HR = 0.76, 95% CI (0.54–1.07)], this finding did not achieve statistical significance, notably limited by heterogeneity in baseline demographics and underpowered analysis. Of note, ACE and ARBs have demonstrated mortality benefit in a large propensity-matched study based on the InterTAK registry, suggesting they may play a supportive role in facilitating LV recovery, especially in patients with severe LV dysfunction or high systemic vascular resistance.11,12Beta-blockersGiven the elevated catecholamine levels from trigger events observed in TTC, beta-blockers have been postulated to have a role in the long-term management of TTC until full recovery of LVEF is achieved, although clinical trials supporting this approach are lacking.33 Plasma catecholamine levels in patients with TTC increase to three times higher than the catecholamine levels in patients with acute myocardial infarction and postinfarction heart failure.40 As such, BB therapy may attenuate the myocardial damage caused by sympathetic overstimulation resulting from catecholamine surge from trigger events. Animal studies have demonstrated that apical ballooning can be mitigated with drugs possessing both alpha and beta-adrenoceptor blocking properties, where intravenous metoprolol has been shown to improve epinephrine-induced apical ballooning.41,42 Beta-blockers have demonstrated inconsistent mortality benefit in the literature.12,37 The lack of specific guideline recommendation for long-term beta-blockers after TTC recovery reflects the variable prescribing patterns in global registries.11,43 The pooled proportion of patients discharged on beta-blockers in our review (61.47%) was similar to that reported in the large multicentre RETAKO registry23 (60%) but lower than the InterTAK registry (78%). Our study demonstrated long-term survival benefit for beta-blockers compared to control. These results should be interpreted with caution and are largely exploratory due to the inclusion of underpowered studies and the notable exclusion of a large propensity-matched study by Templin et al. from the InterTAK registry11 as there were insufficient data to calculate HRs. This study notably failed to demonstrate long-term survival benefit for beta-blockers, and its exclusion represents inherent limitations of meta-analysis; including the use of cumulative data from summary estimates rather than individual patient data and follow-up. The results of our study are thus similar to a recent meta-analysis evaluating the long-term mortality benefit of beta-blockers37 [pooled HR = 0.62; 95% CI (0.50–0.79)], which also excluded the InterTAK study. We hypothesize that inclusion of this study may alter the findings for the following reasons; (i) the study by Templin et al.5 included a broader and more heterogeneous patient population with a greater proportion of patients with severe emotional and physical stressors (27.7% and 36.0%, respectively) and comorbidities, which may have diluted the treatment effect of beta-blockers in the pooled analysis, (ii) differences in average follow-up, and (iii) unmeasured confounding due to overlapping medication use as not all studies in the meta-analysis disclosed the isolated treatment effects of beta-blockers and inconsistently reported distribution of ‘severe TTC’ and incidence of cardiogenic shock, LVOTO > 40 mmHg, and VT. Due to inconsistent reporting of stressors across all included studies, we were unable to perform subgroup analysis for ‘secondary’ TTC, which may have further defined the role of BB in the management of TTC. Importantly, the rationale behind discharging patients on beta-blockers was not clear for all studies. This can be influenced by perceived angina control in patients with concomitant CAD, and discouraged in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as well as haemodynamic status (blood pressure, heart rate, acute heart failure, cardiogenic shock requiring intra-aortic balloon pump, and inotropes).Aspirin and statinsAspirin's role in TTC management has been linked to its potential antithrombotic effect, given the increased platelet activation and endothelial dysfunction associated with TTC pathogenesis.44 Prolonged catecholamine exposure in TTC is thought to trigger platelet aggregation, suggesting that aspirin could mitigate thromboembolic complications.45 In the current meta-analysis, aspirin was associated with a nonsignificant trend towards mortality reduction, highlighting its limited efficacy in this population. While observational studies have shown that antiplatelet therapy at discharge may reduce early adverse outcomes,46 evidence for its long-term benefit remains inconclusive, and aspirin use should be considered on a case-by-case basis, particularly for patients with concomitant CAD. Statins have been postulated to reduce TTC recurrence by reducing microvascular dysfunction and the oxidative stress associated with TTC.5,30 As hypothesized, these theoretical effects did not translate to a significant mortality benefit. In contrast to ACS, TTC is primarily characterized by catecholamine-induced myocardial stunning, microvascular dysfunction, and transient left ventricular wall motion abnormalities, often without significant epicardial coronary obstruction.5LimitationsThis meta-analysis faces several limitations inherent to the available evidence. Our findings are largely exploratory since many studies included in the review lack sufficient statistical power to detect differences in hard clinical endpoints. All included studies were observational, which significantly raises concerns for unmeasured confounding, selection bias, and publication bias. Additionally, the assumption of transitivity in network meta-analysis may be challenged by heterogeneity across studies in terms of population characteristics, treatment definitions, follow-up durations, and statistical adjustments. Inconsistent reporting of medication dosing, overlapping medication regimens, combination therapies, precise timing of commencement and duration of therapy as well as adverse effects/intolerances, likely diluted the inter-group comparisons. Importantly, the rationale behind discharging the patients on each medication group was inconsistently disclosed. Substantial heterogeneity was observed in patient characteristics, ranging from primary to secondary TTC phenotypes, physical and emotional stressors, and variations in LVOTO and LVEF. The evolving diagnostic criteria for TTC further complicate the interpretation of pooled results, as some included cases may represent alternative diagnoses. Despite a generally high methodological quality among the studies, inherent heterogeneity regarding TTC aetiology remains a challenge, compounded by inconsistent use of coronary angiograms and cardiac MRI, potentially leading to misclassification of non-ischaemic myocardial injuries as TTC. The median follow-up of 2.2 years may underestimate the frequency of late events associated with secondary prevention medical therapy. Notably, as a limitation of meta-analysis, we were unable to include all studies for every outcome parameter investigated. Consequently, the number of the patients entering the meta-analysis varies greatly, generally constituting only a fraction of the whole study population.Implications for future researchThe current meta-analysis establishes significant knowledge gaps in the medical management of TTC. Despite the prevalence, morbidity, and mortality associated with TTC, the lack of statistical power and heterogeneity of existing data necessitates higher-quality evidence through RCT evaluation of the differential treatment effects of ACE/ARB, BB, aspirin, and statins. It is hoped that such evidence will be provided by the upcoming NACRAM (n-Acetylcysteine and Ramipril Takotsubo Syndrome Trial, ACTRN12616000781448) and BROKEN-SWEDEHEART [Optimized Pharmacological Treatment for Broken Heart (Takotsubo) Syndrome, NCT04666454], and Beta-Blockers in Takotsubo Syndrome Study (β-Tako, NCT06509074) trials. Machine-learning approaches may enhance TTC prognostication by identifying phenotypic clusters with distinct risk profiles. Integrating these methods into future studies could further tailor patient management strategies and clarify the role of secondary prevention therapies in high-risk subgroups.47 Research into the effects of stress and adrenergic stimulation on the heart and other organs is extensive, but the impact of elevated catecholamines remains less understood. High stress and catecholamine levels affect cardiovascular function through various mechanisms, including receptor dynamics, signalling pathways, mitochondrial activity, inflammation, metabolism, and gene expression. Previous studies have reported reduction in ‘all-cause’ and cardiac mortality in patients treated with ACE or ARB, and beta-blockers,33 however we were unable to pool separate results in the current meta-analysis due to inconsistent data with many studies not powered to detect mortality. As such, the cardiac/non-cardiac mortality ratio, the exact influence of pharmacotherapy on non-cardiac mortality, and why TTC patients remain at risk of long-term mortality remain uncertain.ConclusionsThis review highlights the modest efficacy of secondary prevention medications in the management of TTC. Randomized controlled trials are necessary to define the treatment effects of pharmacotherapy in this vulnerable patient cohort.Supplementary Materialoeaf040_Supplementary_Data"}

However, various challenges, such as usability, privacy, inequality, and misdiagnosis, complicate its application. This literature review focuses on AI’s role in cardiology, specifically its impact on the diagnostic accuracy of AI algorithms analyzing 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) to detect left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Methods: Following PRISMA 2020 guidelines, we conducted a comprehensive search of PubMed, CENTRAL, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library. Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), observational studies, and case–control studies across various settings. This review is registered in the PROSPERO database (registration number 531468). Results: Seven significant studies were selected and included in our review. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan. Co-CNN (with incorporated demographic data and clinical variables) demonstrated the highest weighted average sensitivity at 0.84. 2D-CNN models (with demographic features) showed a balanced performance with good sensitivity (0.62) and high specificity (0.82); Co-CNN models excelled in sensitivity (0.84) but had lower specificity (0.71). Traditional ECG criteria (SLV and CV) maintained high specificities but low sensitivities. Scatter plots revealed trends between demographic factors and performance metrics. Conclusions: AI algorithms can rapidly analyze ECG data with high sensitivity. The diagnostic accuracy of AI models is variable but generally comparable to classical criteria. Clinical data and the training population of AI algorithms play a critical role in their efficacy. Future research should focus on collecting diverse ECG data across different populations to improve the generalizability of AI algorithms.", "body": "1. IntroductionLeft ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a cardiac condition with an increased left ventricular mass. This is measured in relation to body weight and often results from chronic pressure overload [1]. Early detection of LVH due to arterial hypertension is crucial, as it is an independent prognostic factor for cardiovascular events [2]. Traditionally, electrocardiogram (ECG) criteria, such as the Cornell voltage and Sokolow-Lyon voltage, have been used to diagnose LVH [3]. However, these conventional methods have demonstrated limited sensitivity (approximately 19–25%), potentially leading to missed diagnoses [4].In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL) techniques have revolutionized medical image analysis and diagnostic processes in cardiology. These advanced computational methods have shown remarkable potential in automatically extracting features from large datasets, significantly improving the performance of various cardiac diagnostic tasks [5,6].Researchers have developed AI algorithms to detect a wide range of cardiovascular conditions using electrocardiogram (ECG) data. For instance, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been employed to analyze voltage-time waveforms from ECGs to recognize patterns associated with left ventricular dysfunction or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [7]. Other studies have utilized deep learning models to predict paroxysmal atrial fibrillation based on ECG in normal sinus rhythm [8,9,10,11].The application of deep learning to ECG interpretation presents a promising avenue for enhancing the detection of LVH, potentially overcoming the limitations of traditional diagnostic criteria [4]. Several studies have explored the uses of deep learning algorithms, such as CNNs and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, in analyzing 12-lead ECGs for LVH detection [12,13]. These approaches have demonstrated improved sensitivity and overall diagnostic accuracy compared to conventional ECG criteria.Recent research by Shimizu et al. analyzed ECG features’ diagnostic performance based on historical (classical) criteria and machine learning models for LVH detection [14]. While conventional parameters like Cornell voltage showed good accuracy, machine learning (ML) models identified non-traditional ECG parameters as essential predictors of LVH. These included mean QT interval, mean QRS duration, and R wave amplitude in lead I. Both supervised and unsupervised ML models can be used in this subfield [15,16]. Interestingly, advanced techniques like the Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) method revealed that V2/V3 S-wave amplitude and I/V5 T-wave amplitude played essential roles in the AI models’ decision-making process [14].In this review, we focus on surveying supervised learning techniques. That means one needs labeled training data to predict the class labels using a particular method. We briefly present some of those methods: classical ones are, e.g., K-nearest neighbor (KNN) or support vector machine (SVM) classification [15,16]. KNN usually requires the Euclidian distance between data points to predict the class of a new data point, measuring their similarity. KNN is to be determined by minimizing the classification error using performance measures such as F-measure, precision, recall, and so forth [15] (pp. 211–213). Another classical method for supervised learning is artificial (classical) neural networks. They consist of an input layer, several hidden layers, and an output layer where weights must be determined using backpropagation [15]. While backpropagation does not often work in practice, convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been developed [17] (pp. 372–390). They have been used extensively to learn local structures in complex data and, therefore, they have been more efficient than classical NN because the information of parameters can be shared.Integrating AI with portable ECG devices presents novel opportunities for widespread, accessible LVH screening. AI applications that analyze ECG can now be used in mobile phones and other telemetry devices, including wearable and implantable recording devices. This convergence of AI and portable technology holds great promise for improving the early detection and management of LVH in diverse clinical settings. AI applications in cardiology can be categorized based on their functionality and the specific cardiac conditions they address. In Table 1, a few examples of them are presented [18,19,20,21,22].Given the rapid evolution of deep learning techniques and their increasing application in cardiology, a comprehensive review of the current literature on AI-based LVH detection is warranted. This review aims to systematically assess the diagnostic accuracy of deep learning models using 12-lead ECGs for LVH detection and evaluate their potential utility in clinical practice.2. Materials and MethodsThis review’s reporting was guided by the standards of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) Statement [24]. Eligible studies are randomized controlled trials (RCTs), observational studies, and case–control studies in different settings: primary care clinics, hospitals, and community health centers.The review protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database (registration number: 531468) and is accessible for public scrutiny via the PROSPERO online platform (https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/display_record.php?RecordID=531468, accessed on 13 February 2025).A search was conducted using MEDLINE, CENTRAL, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases. The search strategy is presented in Figure 1.The first and second steps consisted of screening titles and abstracts, followed by screening the cited articles in full text. The search terms included “artificial intelligence”, “electrocardiogram”, “left ventricle hypertrophy”, “echocardiography”, “deep learning”, “sensitivity and specificity”, “accuracy of electrocardiogram analysis”, and “artificial intelligence algorithm”.Performance measures for search strategies will be evaluated with search recall (search sensitivity) and precision. The criteria for eligible studies were as follows: (1) studies whose main tasks related to the detection or prediction of left ventricular hypertrophy; (2) studies that developed AI models by utilizing either deep learning or conventional machine learning algorithms; (3) studies that developed AI models for smartphones or using data acquired from mobile devices.Data collection was performed based on pre-defined study PICO criteria:-Population: adult patients (out- and inpatients) with written electrocardiogram-Intervention: analysis of electrocardiogram-Comparator: human interpretation with imaging modalities-Outcome: sensitivity and specificity of AI algorithmsData were extracted directly from journal articles and other study reports. Reports were made based on STARD (for diagnostic accuracy studies). Two independent reviewers (A.M. and G.A.) screened the search results to identify articles that closely aligned with the objectives and scope of our review. The publication date, the journal’s impact factor, and the authors’ credentials assessed the credibility and relevance of each article and focused on studies that report accuracy metrics were examined (e.g., sensitivity, specificity, along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), positive predictive value, negative predictive value).The selection of studies was performed based on the criteria mentioned below.Inclusion criteria:-Studies that utilize ML or DL algorithms with ECG data for diagnosing LVH-Research conducted in the last few years-Studies where LVH diagnosis is confirmed through echocardiography or cardiac MRI.-Research that directly compares AI results with the imaging-based LVH diagnosis.Exclusion criteria:-Studies that do not involve ML or DL techniques-Research performed before 2000-Studies lacking standardized datasets for evaluation-Models with limited interpretability-Inconsistency in performance when using new datasets-Concerns related to security, privacy of health data, and collaboration with physicians-Studies using other ECG configurations (e.g., single-lead or 3-lead)-Research unrelated to LVH-Studies with inadequate ECG data quality-Studies using other imaging modalities not specified (e.g., thoracic computed tomography)-Research without a direct comparison between AI and imaging-based LVH diagnosis-Investigations with inadequate sample sizes or methodological flaws.We conducted a literature review of diagnostic accuracy using Cochrane recommendations and RevMan (review manager); this process involves several key steps:-Definition of title and objective of the review-Searching the diagnostic studies-Selection of included studies and data extraction-Assessment of study quality-Statistical analysis-Interpretation of results and development of recommendations3. ResultsFifteen potentially relevant articles were initially selected for full-length review. Eight articles were removed due to exclusion criteria (Table 2). To mitigate potential bias in LVH quantification, particularly the risk of LVH underestimation associated with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, we ultimately opted to restrict our analysis to studies employing echocardiography as the primary imaging modality. This methodological decision was made to ensure consistency in LVH assessment and enhance results’ comparability across included studies.Study characteristics are presented in Table 3. The table compares the results of different studies on LVH, focusing on sample sizes, methodologies used AI models), and predictive performance metrics. Table 4 provides more detailed information about the AI methodologies used in each study, including specific architectural details, optimization techniques, and strategies for addressing common challenges in ECG-based LVH detection.Study characteristics are presented in Table 3. The table compares the results of different studies on LVH, focusing on sample sizes, methodologies that used AI models, and predictive performance metrics. Table 4 provides more detailed information about the AI methodologies used in each study, including specific architectural details, optimization techniques, and strategies for addressing common challenges in ECG-based LVH detection. Diagnostic accuracy is presented separately in Figure 2 which shows that ENN models show generally high accuracy, whereas CNN models show variable performance; DNN models demonstrate good and consistent performance. SL criteria show consistent but generally slightly lower accuracy compared to AI models.Figure 3a,b present an assessment of the risk of bias and applicability concerns across several studies. Most studies demonstrate a low risk of bias and low applicability concerns, as evidenced by the prevalence of green plus signs. Salazar (2021) [38] exhibits an unclear rating in the “Flow and timing” category under “Risk of Bias”. Zhao (2022) [12] displays unclear ratings in “Patient selection” under both “Risk of Bias” and “Applicability Concerns”.Meta-analysis was performed with the RevMan (8.16.0.) program after importing study data (mean, standard deviation, sample size, sensitivity, specificity), presented in Figure 4 and Figure 5. Co-CNN (with incorporated demographic data and clinical variables) demonstrated the highest weighted average sensitivity at 0.84. 2D-CNN models (with demographic features) showed a balanced performance with good sensitivity (0.62) and high specificity (0.82); Co-CNN models excelled in sensitivity (0.84) but had lower specificity (0.71). Traditional ECG criteria (SLV and CV) maintained high specificities but low sensitivities. The ROC curves demonstrate a clear trade-off between sensitivity and specificity across all models, with most curves positioned above the diagonal reference line, indicating better-than-random performance. The curves suggest that Co-CNN architecture achieves the most favorable balance between sensitivity and specificity for LVH detection.4. DiscussionA study by Kwon et al. (2019) was one of the first to utilize a large-scale ECG dataset (21,286 subjects) with artificial intelligence for LVH detection [13]. Their approach incorporated both ECG and demographic information. It set a benchmark for AI-based LVH detection but also revealed the challenges in balancing sensitivity and specificity. It emphasized the importance of considering demographic factors alongside ECG data. The study by Kokubo et al. (2020) highlighted the potential superiority of AI models over traditional criteria while also showing that different AI algorithms can yield varying results [33]. This underscores the importance of model selection in AI-based ECG analysis. A study from Cai et al. (2024) represents a significant advancement in AI-based LVH detection, achieving high accuracy while maintaining a balance between sensitivity and specificity [36]. It reinforces the value of integrating demographic data with ECG analysis. Ryu and colleagues (2023) highlighted the gender disparities in AI-based LVH detection, suggesting that models may need to be tailored or adjusted based on gender for optimal performance [37]. It also introduced a new model architecture that shows promise for ECG analysis. While a study from Zhao et al. (2022) did not achieve the highest overall accuracy, it showed the potential of hybrid deep learning architectures in ECG analysis [12]. The balanced sensitivity and specificity suggest that this approach might be beneficial for initial screening purposes.These detailed analyses of individual studies reveal the progression of AI-based LVH detection over time, from early large-scale implementations to more sophisticated models incorporating demographic data and novel architecture. They also highlight recurring themes such as the trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity, the importance of demographic factors, and the emerging consideration of gender differences in model performance. This evolution in approach and performance underscores the rapid advancement in the field and the potential for further improvements in AI-based ECG analysis for LVH detection.4.1. Performance Variability and Model SelectionThe results indicate that AI algorithms, particularly ENN and some CNN variants, can potentially improve the diagnostic accuracy of LVH detection compared to traditional ECG criteria. However, the variations in performance metrics across the reviewed studies highlight the importance of tailoring model selection to specific clinical questions. Our analysis reveals a clear correlation between demographic factors and performance metrics, underscoring the crucial role of clinical data in enhancing the efficacy of neural network models for LVH detection.4.2. Impact of Clinical Data IntegrationIncorporating factors such as age, hypertension history, and other clinical characteristics significantly enhance the sensitivity of AI algorithms. However, reliance on clinical factors alongside ECG data raises essential considerations. Firstly, fairness concerns emerge when using ECGs as the sole diagnostic tool, as noted in studies like Zhao et al. [12]. Incorporating extensive clinical and laboratory variables moves beyond ECG data alone, potentially limiting its utility as a standalone screening tool. Many clinical and laboratory data inputs are often unavailable in routine clinical settings [12], highlighting the need for additional data sources in AI-based diagnostic systems.These challenges support the hypothesis that hybrid models, integrating multiple data types, may offer more robust analytical capabilities, especially when handling complex datasets with diverse patient characteristics. The studies in this meta-analysis employ various AI techniques for LVH detection, each with distinct strengths and limitations. To provide a comprehensive overview of the AI models utilized in this meta-analysis, the advantages and disadvantages in the context of our topic are presented in Table 5 [4,15,16].This comparative analysis highlights the diverse approaches in AI-based LVH detection, each offering unique benefits and challenges. The choice of models depends on specific clinical needs, available data, and the desired balance between performance and interpretability. CNNs demonstrate high specificity but may require extensive training datasets. DNNs offer versatility but can be prone to overfitting. ENNs may achieve higher accuracy but with increased computational complexity [4,15,16]. Co-CNNs show high sensitivity but may face limitations in clinical settings where additional patient data are not readily available. Understanding these nuances is crucial for interpreting study results and guiding future research in AI-based LVH detection.4.3. Complexity of LVH DiagnosisThe underlying causes of LVH must be considered, as these can substantially influence diagnostic interpretation. Unexplained LVH, as investigated by Sammani [39], could be linked to conditions such as amyloidosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (a genetic form of LVH), or storage cardiomyopathies. These conditions may exhibit distinct ECG features, including low voltage, which can complicate the diagnosis. Additionally, various clinical conditions associated with LVH may alter electrical properties in the heart, resulting in diverse QRS patterns, such as left axis deviation, fascicular blocks, bundle branch blocks, Q waves, and fragmented QRS [40]. These complexities further highlight the challenge of developing a universal AI model that accounts for the full spectrum of LVH causes.4.4. Imaging Modality ConsiderationsAnother critical factor when evaluating AI algorithms for LVH detection is the choice of imaging modality. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) and echocardiography are the primary imaging techniques offering distinct advantages and limitations. While CMR is considered the gold standard for LVH diagnosis, it may underestimate LVH (measured as left ventricular mass) [41]. Conversely, Echocardiography is more widely available but can be limited by image resolution and operator dependence. Furthermore, CMR and echocardiography have different normative values, complicating direct comparisons between AI models trained on data derived from these modalities.4.5. Challenges in Machine Learning ApplicationA significant theoretical challenge in applying ML algorithms for LVH detection is input data variability, particularly using different training cohorts. This variability can introduce biases and exacerbate the “black box” nature of ML models, raising concerns about the models’ reliability and generalizability. It is a well-known fact that ML models heavily depend on the quality and representativeness of their training data. Suppose training cohorts are not diverse or balanced. In that case, the models may inherit biases—such as demographic imbalances (e.g., age, sex, ethnicity) or clinical differences (e.g., comorbidities or underlying LVH mechanisms like storage diseases or athlete’s heart). Studies have shown that ML models trained on specific populations perform poorly when applied to external datasets with differing characteristics [42,43,44].A ‘black box’ in artificial intelligence refers to an AI system whose internal working or decision-making processes are opaque and not easily understandable to humans. Also, a mathematical function or equation of the input and output can rarely be inferred. ‘Black box’ models are typically created directly from large datasets through machine learning algorithms rather than being explicitly programmed. This lack of transparency makes it difficult to understand how the model arrives at its conclusions or identify potential prediction biases. For example, a deep learning model trained on echocardiograms from a specific institution may show variations in performance when applied to datasets from other centers [44,45]. The “black box” nature of many AI models presents clinical interpretation and adoption challenges, prompting research into explainable AI techniques. Variability in training data and the choice of imaging modality for LVH confirmation (echocardiography vs. cardiac MRI) introduce additional complexities in model development and validation.To mitigate the “black box” problem, researchers are developing explainable AI (XAI) methods, such as Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), which can highlight the key features influencing predictions, such as specific ECG parameters related to LVH [46,47]. External validation using independent datasets is crucial to assess the robustness of ML models and minimize the risk of overfitting to particular cohorts. Models consistently performing well across diverse datasets are more likely to have clinical utility and demonstrate broader generalizability.Another limitation of ML is imbalanced datasets, with a lower prevalence of LVH cases compared to non-LVH cases [4]. This imbalance reflects real-world clinical scenarios but can pose challenges for ML models. A few studies explicitly mentioned using data balancing methods. One study used the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to address class imbalance [48]. Taconne et al. employed random undersampling of the majority class [16]. In the studies that reported using balancing techniques, there was a general trend towards improved sensitivity for LVH detection, often at the cost of slightly reduced specificity [48,49]. The use or absence of data balancing techniques could potentially influence the reported performance metrics, particularly sensitivity and specificity. This variability in methodology may contribute to the heterogeneity observed in our meta-analysis results. Given these observations, we acknowledge that the inconsistent reporting and application of data balancing methods is a limitation of our review.5. ConclusionsMachine learning (ML) algorithms have been proven beneficial and promising for detecting left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) with higher sensitivity and specificity than traditional methods. However, their reliance on varied training data introduces challenges related to bias and interpretability. Future research in AI-based LVH detection should prioritize three key areas to enhance the reliability and clinical applicability of these models. First, data collection efforts should focus on gathering diverse ECG data from populations with the exact LVH etiology, including a wide range of demographic characteristics and clinical backgrounds. This approach will improve the generalizability of AI algorithms across different patient populations. Second, the emphasis should be on enhancing model interpretability, enabling clinicians to understand the decision-making process of AI systems. This increased transparency will help build trust and facilitate the integration of AI into clinical practice. Finally, rigorous external validation should be conducted to ensure AI models’ reliability and equitable performance across diverse healthcare settings. By addressing these interconnected objectives, researchers can develop AI models for LVH detection that are accurate, trustworthy, and clinically relevant, ultimately improving the diagnosis and management of LVH across diverse patient populations."}
