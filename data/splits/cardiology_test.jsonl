{"PMCID": "12089254", "title": "Effect of osteoporosis medications on vascular and valvular calcification: a systematic review and meta-analysis", "abstract": "ObjectiveVascular calcification shares many features with skeletal mineralisation and shares an inverse relationship with osteoporosis (skeletal de-mineralisation). However, medications that reduce bone loss (anti-resorptives) have had inconsistent effects on extra-skeletal mineralisation (i.e. vascular and valvular calcification). As such, this paper aims to synthesise existing literature examining the effect of anti-resorptive treatments on extra-skeletal (vascular and valvular) calcification across populations.MethodsMedline and Embase were searched (inception to October 2024) for studies that assessed the association between anti-resorptive medication use and vascular/valvular calcification. Pooled standardised mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for all outcomes, using random-effects model. Leave-one-out sensitivity analyses were performed for internal validity.ResultsOf 4071 articles screened, 33 were included in the review, and 15 (2344 participants) had data available for meta-analysis. Anti-resorptive use was associated with non-significant, small magnitude improvements in abdominal aortic calcification (decreased value), coronary artery calcification (decreased value) and ejection fraction (increased value) but significant small reduction in aortic valve area (representing less calcification on the valve) with standardised mean difference of − 0.45 (95% confidence interval (CI) − 0.99; 0.08, I2 = 84%), − 1.19 (95% CI − 2.92; 0.55, I2 = 91%), − 0.67 (95% CI − 1.72; 0.38, I2 = 94%), 0.26 (95% CI − 0.14; 0.66, I2 = 62%) and 0.56 (95% CI 0.07; 1.06, I2 = 76%), respectively.ConclusionThe significance of small positive effect of anti-resorptives on aortic stenosis is clinically uncertain. Despite strong biological links between vascular calcification and skeletal mineralisation, anti-resorptives do not appear to have a strong favourable influence on extra-skeletal mineralisation. This suggests that mechanisms that link vascular calcification with osteoporosis may be acting in pathways not influenced by anti-resorptives.SummaryThis systematic review and meta-analysis summarises the effect of anti-resorptives on vascular and valvular calcification. There is a small, positive effect of anti-resorptives on aortic stenosis, though this is of uncertain clinical importance.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00198-025-07468-3.", "body": "IntroductionCardiovascular disease (CVD) and osteoporosis share many risk factors such as ageing, smoking, unhealthy diet (high sugar, high saturated fat, low protein), low levels of exercise and increased weight leading to speculation for common causative pathways [1]. One of the most frequently described links between CVD and osteoporosis is vascular calcification. Indeed, there is a strong inverse relationship between vascular calcification and bone mineral density (BMD). For example, calcification in the abdominal aorta (AAC) is associated with reduced BMD at various clinically relevant sites, and increased fracture risk at multiple clinically relevant sites [2]. The biological mechanism that drives vascular calcification is reminiscent of mineralisation of the skeleton involving calcium deposition by vascular smooth muscle cells that have undergone cellular transdifferentiation and appear phenotypically as osteoblast-like cells [3]. Given that osteoporosis treatments target well-described key drivers of bone loss, it has thus been speculated that these same treatments could favourably influence the incidence and progression of extra-skeletal mineralisation. Specifically, osteoporosis treatment targets osteoclast action (these would include the anti-resorptive agents—bisphosphonates, which mediate osteoclasts apoptosis; denosumab which is a monoclonal antibody against RANKL that inhibits bone resorption and osteoclast activity via the RANK/RANKL pathway), and osteoblast action (teriparatide is a parathyroid hormone (PTH) analogue that upregulates osteoblastogenic growth factors; romosozumab is a monoclonal antibody sclerostin antagonist that works to promote osteoblast production) [4–6]. To this end, several studies have explored the hypothesis that osteoporosis treatments could influence extra-skeletal mineralisation, albeit with heterogeneous responses [1, 7]. Much of the literature in this area has been directed towards understanding pathogenesis and treatment options in patient with chronic kidney disease (CKD). This is understandable given the burden of extra-skeletal calcification in this patient group, owing to the underlying bone and mineral disturbance from their CKD. Given that renal bone disease has its own distinct pathophysiology, there is a need to understand the overall effect of anti-osteoporosis medications in all patient groups, whose underlying bone and mineral pathophysiology could be reversed by available anti-osteoporosis treatments. A recent meta-analysis attempted to address this topic but was limited in its scope of included trials. This meta-analysis only included two trials with anti-resorptive agents which showed mixed results [8]. Another systematic review focused solely on the effect of anti-osteoporotic medications on coronary artery calcification (CAC) only and did not investigate other forms of vascular calcification and as such this study is limited by assessing only one calcification outcome [9]. Their review which included four observational studies and one randomised controlled trial (RCT) with a total of 377 patients also showed mixed results. Furthermore, very little attention is given to valvular calcification with respect to understanding extra-skeletal mineralisation in osteoporosis, despite several observational studies demonstrating potential for slower progression of valvular calcification in patients receiving anti-resorptive medications [10, 11]. It has been hypothesised that the pathophysiology behind valvular and vascular calcification belong to the same causal pathway, and for this reason, there is a need to systematically and comprehensively examine the evidence for anti-resorptive medications on extra-skeletal (valvular and vascular) calcification across indications. Therefore, we aimed to synthesise existing literature examining the effect of anti-resorptive medications on the calcification process on valves and arteries, at clinically actionable sites, in any population.Materials and methodsData sources and searchesWe searched two databases (Medline and Embase) from inception to 15 October 2024 for relevant papers. There were no language restrictions. Studies were identified using the search strategy detailed in Supplementary Table 1. Records were then stored using a citation manager and duplicates were removed. All titles and abstracts were screened before evaluating the eligibility of the full texts. Manual screening of cited references of eligible texts and online related article lists were also done to identify publications that were potentially relevant.Study selectionThis systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement, and it is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024518650) [12]. We included studies that specifically reported any of the following outcomes: incidence and/or progression of vascular calcification (at any site) or incidence and/or progression of (any) valvular calcification (including any echocardiographic measure of such) or progression of ejection fraction. Studies were included if the trial was randomised or a controlled prospective cohort study and provided any of the above outcomes. Specific exclusion criteria included non-controlled studies, systematic reviews, reviews, conference abstracts, letters, case reports and animal or cell-based studies.Data extraction and quality assessmentData was extracted by a single reviewer (HZL) using a data extraction form and was checked for accuracy by another reviewer (AJR). We obtained data on the total number of enrolled patients, treatment used; comparator used; patient demographics (age, sex, basal metabolic index (BMI), blood pressure (BP), alcoholic, smoking status); medical conditions (diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidaemia, coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease, heart failure (HF), CKD, osteoporosis, chronic liver disease, previous aortic stenosis, previous acute myocardial infarction (AMI), previous percutaneous coronary intervention, previous coronary artery bypass graft, previous stroke/transient ischaemic attack (TIA) and malignancy); medications (statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi)/angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), steroids, vitamin D, calcium, phosphate binder) and osteoporotic features (baseline vertebral BMD, baseline lumbar spine BMD, baseline femoral neck BMD, previous vertebral fracture); and outcomes of interest with units of measurable change (AAC volume, CAC volume and Hu, aortic valve area and ejection fraction). Potentially relevant but missing data was sought directly from study authors via email.Two independent reviewers (HZL and AJR) used the Cochrane Collaboration risk-of-bias tool for randomised trials to assess risk of bias [13]. This tool evaluates bias across seven domains: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting and other bias (e.g. representativeness). A judgement of low, unclear or high risk of bias was made for each domain. An overall risk of bias per study was evaluated based on the following criteria: low—all domains low; low/unclear—all domains low except for one that was unclear; unclear—greater or equal to two unclear domains; high—any domain was high. The Newcastle–Ottawa Scale was used to assess risk of bias in cohort studies [14]. This scale evaluates bias across three broad domains: selection of cohorts, comparability of cohorts and the assessment of outcome of the studies. A judgement of overall good, fair or poor quality was determined for each study according to the ‘star system’. Good-quality studies were evaluated as having three or four stars in the selection domain and one or two stars in the comparability domain and two or three stars in the outcome domain. Fair quality studies were evaluated as having two stars in the selection domain and one or two stars in the comparability domain and two or three stars in the outcome domain. Poor-quality studies were evaluated as having zero or one star in the selection domain or zero stars in the comparability domain or zero or one stars in the outcome domain. For studies where there were inconsistencies between the reviewers regarding the overall risk of bias, a consensus meeting was held to resolve disagreements.Data synthesis and analysisStudies were suitable for meta-analysis if they initially satisfied the inclusion–exclusion criteria and reported at least one outcome of interest. Analyses were performed separately by outcome of interest. We meta-analysed data for outcomes that were reported in at least three studies. Data was pooled together in an inverse-variance model assuming random-effects (and fixed/common effects reported for completeness) where a standardised mean difference (SMD) for the overall effect estimate was obtained together with the 95% confidence interval (95% CI). For studies which examined at different anti-resorptive treatments (for example using a bisphosphonate and using denosumab), where pooled results were not provided, we reported our analysis using both treatments in separate analyses. This was done for Geers et al. (2024) where the authors looked at treatment with denosumab or alendronate and so we reported our analysis first using the denosumab data and then again using the alendronate data [15]. Heterogeneity was evaluated by calculating the tau2 statistic (an estimate of the between-study variance) and the proportion of total variability due to between-study heterogeneity was evaluated by the I2 statistic. All data were computed using the meta package in R (version 4.1.3). For assessment of internal validity, a leave-one-out sensitivity analysis was performed for each analysis. Finally, assessment of publication bias was done by visual inspection of a funnel plot. In certain instances, key data such as a standard deviation or error was not reported in published papers. An example of this is Hill et al. (2002) where change in coronary artery calcification (CAC) volume was recorded but the variation for the mean effect was not [16]. In such instances, these data were sought directly from authors, where no timely response was forthcoming (2-week response deadline given); the missing data was imputed from the linear prediction of a model including study mean and populations, in an effort to include as much known literature as possible to minimise publication bias (i.e. avoid exclusion of a known publication).ResultsLiterature searchThe literature search yielded 6373 results, and 2302 duplicates were removed, leaving 4071 records for title and abstract screening. Reports were excluded due to being irrelevant (n = 3914), no full text (n = 35), non-human studies (n = 42), ineligible study design (n = 47) and case reports (n = 6). Additional hand searching found another six eligible articles. Overall, 33 studies [11, 15–46] were included in the qualitative analysis (Fig. 1).Fig. 1PRISMA flowchartIncluded studiesThere were no restrictions to the population and we collected data on studies that included any patients (general population/community dwelling older adults) (n = 29), patients with osteoporosis (n = 6), patients on haemodialysis (n = 8), patients on post-menopausal (n = 8), patients with aortic stenosis (n = 4), patients with type 2 DM (n = 2), patients with CKD (n = 2), patients at high risk for atherosclerotic aortic plaques (n = 1), patients on bisphosphonate therapy (n = 1), patients with pseudoxanthoma elasticum (n = 2), patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism (n = 2) and patients with AMI (n = 1).

Seven studies reported CAC; eight studies reported AAC; one study reported common carotid artery calcification; two studies reported mitral annulus calcification; one study reported iliac arteries calcification; one study reported lower limb arterial calcification; one study reported femoral artery calcification; one study reported total arterial calcification; nineteen reported aortic calcification (any site); five studies reported aortic valve area (AVA) (Table 2). Three studies reported ejection fraction (EF). EF is not strictly a marker of vascular/valvular calcification; we reasoned that EF would be influenced by valvular and vascular calcification and is included as an exploratory, hypothesis generating endpoint. Of interest, six studies reported on carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), but, as this represents atherosclerotic plaque not necessarily calcified, we chose to not analyse these data. Furthermore, as there was not a specific search term for IMT, we also cannot be certain that we have captured all literature reporting on osteoporosis medications and IMT.Major findings from the included studies are described in Table 2. Etidronate resulted in less progression in coronary artery, femoral artery, thoracic and abdominal aortic calcification in seven studies [17, 19, 26, 29, 34, 41, 43]. Alendronate resulted in less progression in AAC and aortic stenosis in two studies [11, 28], and no difference in progression of CAC, aortic calcification and aortic stenosis in five studies [15, 16, 24, 30, 37]. Ibandronate resulted in no difference in AAC progression in one study [18]. Risedronate resulted in less progression in AAC and vascular calcification in two studies [23, 42]. Denosumab resulted in less progression in CAC and AAC in three studies [32, 35, 46], and no difference in AAC, aortic stenosis and CAC progression in three studies [15, 27, 37]. Zoledronate resulted in no difference in AAC progression in one study [33].Meta-analysisFifteen studies, including a total of 2344 patients, had data available for meta-analysis (Fig. 2A–E). Specifically, studies that reported aortic calcification (any site) were not able to be analysed as varying units of measurements were used, for example, reporting on a percentage of the cohort that experience regression/progression of calcification as opposed to some measure of change in calcification. Therefore, we focused our analysis on outcomes for which units of measurable change were reported for a more targeted and clinically relevant analysis. Other studies not included were due to a lack of control group or specific results that were required for analysis. Parameters like mitral annular calcification and pulse wave velocity were unable to be analysed due to a lack of sufficient data.Fig. 2A Forest plot of standardised mean difference for change in abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) and coronary artery calcification (volume) (CAC-volume).

Suzuki included patients on haemodialysis and treated them with denosumab; Hashiba included patients on haemodialysis and treated them with etidronate; Bartstra included patients with pseudoxanthoma elasticum and treated them with etidronate; Okamoto included patients with kidney transplant and treated them with denosumab; Samelson included post-menopausal and osteoporotic patients and treated them with denosumab as a secondary analysis of a larger fracture reduction trial; Kanazawa included patients who were post-menopausal, were osteoporotic and had type 2 diabetes mellitus. When pooled together, the rates of AAC progression were similar (SMD =  − 0.45 [95% confidence interval − 0.99 to 0.08, tau2 = 0.33; n = 935; I2 = 84%; Fig. 2A]), where SMD represents the difference in the change in vascular outcome (AAC) between treatment and control groups. Focusing specifically on patients on etidronate, four studies with a total of 1721 patients studied the effects of etidronate on change in AAC [23, 27, 28, 36]. When pooled together, the rates of AAC progression were similar (SMD =  − 0.41 [95% confidence interval − 1.24 to 0.41, tau2 = 0.58, n = 889; I2 = 89%; Fig. 2B]). Focusing specifically on haemodialysis patients, four studies with a total of 1736 patients, studied the effects of haemodialysis on change in AAC [23, 27, 28, 34]. When pooled together, the rates of AAC progression were similar (SMD =  − 0.08 [95% confidence interval 0.31 to 0.16, tau2 = 0.019, n = 898; I2 = 2%; Fig. 2C]).Coronary artery calcification (volume)Four studies, including 239 patients, reported on change in volume of CAC (CAC-volume) as an outcome of anti-resorptive therapy [16, 19, 32, 34]. Chen included patients who were on haemodialysis and had secondary hyperparathyroidism and treated them with denosumab; Hill included osteoporotic patients and treated them with alendronate; Ariyoshi included patients on haemodialysis and treated them with etidronate; Bartstra included patients with pseudoxanthoma elasticum and treated them with etidronate. When pooled together, the rates of CAC-volume progression were similar (SMD =  − 1.19 [95% confidence interval − 2.92 to 0.55, tau2 = 2.96; n = 120; I2 = 91%; Fig. 2A]), where SMD represents the difference in the change in vascular outcome (CAC-volume) between treatment and control groups. Focusing specifically on patients on etidronate, two studies with a total of 154 patients studied the effects of etidronate on change in CAC (CAC-volume) [16, 32]. When pooled together, the rates of CAC-volume progression were similar (SMD =  − 2.34 [95% confidence interval − 5.26 to 0.58, tau2 = 4.27, n = 77; I2 = 96%; Fig. 2B]). Focusing specifically on haemodialysis patients, four studies with a total of 185 patients studied the effects of haemodialysis on change in CAC (CAC-volume) [16, 34]. When pooled together, the rates of CAC-volume progression were similar (SMD =  − 0.46 [95% confidence interval − 1.33 to 0.42, tau2 = 0.0.35, n = 93; I2 = 88%; Fig. 2C]).Coronary artery calcification (Hu)Three studies, including 218 patients, reported on change in volume of CAC (CAC-Hu) as an outcome of anti-resorptive therapy [15, 16, 46]. Chen included patients who were on haemodialysis and had secondary hyperparathyroidism and treated them with denosumab; Hill included osteoporotic patients and treated them with alendronate; Geers included patients with aortic stenosis and treated them with either denosumab or alendronate. When pooled together, the rates of CAC-Hu progression were similar (when including those treated with denosumab in Geers et al.) (SMD =  − 0.28 [95% confidence interval − 2.09 to 1.53, tau2 = 2.48; n = 112; I2 = 97%; Fig. 2D]) and CAC-Hu (when including those treated with alendronate in Geers et al.) (SMD =  − 0.67 [95% confidence interval − 1.72 to 0.38, tau2 = 0.784; n = 104; I2 = 94%; Fig. 2D]), where SMD represents the difference in the change in vascular outcome (CAC-Hu) between treatment and control groups.Aortic valve area (aortic stenosis)Four studies, including 353 patients, reported on change in aortic valve area or aortic stenosis (AVA-AS) as an outcome of anti-resorptive therapy [11, 20, 21, 37]. Skolnick had no specific exclusion criteria for the population and treated the patients with bisphosphonates, calcitonin or selective oestrogen receptor modulators; Pawade included patients with aortic stenosis and treated them with denosumab or alendronate, but helpfully provided data for ‘any antiresorptive use’; Alishiri included patients with aortic stenosis and osteoporosis and treated them with alendronate; Innasimuthu included patients with aortic stenosis and treated them with alendronate or risedronate. When pooled together, there was a significant small increase in AVA-AS (SMD = 0.56 [95% confidence interval 0.07 to 1.06, tau2 = 0.18; n = 165; I2 = 76%; Fig. 2E]), where SMD represents the difference in the change in vascular outcome (AVA-AS) between treatment and control groups. This means that the rate of progression in stenosis was marginally slower in those on anti-resorptives.Ejection fractionThree studies, including 201 patients, reported on percentage change in EF as an outcome of anti-resorptive therapy [11, 20, 21]. Skolnick had no specific exclusion criteria for the population and treated the patients with bisphosphonates, calcitonin or selective oestrogen receptor modulators; Innasimuthu included patients with aortic stenosis and treated them with alendronate or risedronate; Alishiri included patients with aortic stenosis and osteoporosis and treated them with alendronate. When pooled together, there was no increase in EF (SMD = 0.26 [95% confidence interval − 0.14 to 0.66, tau2 = 0.038; n = 63; I2 = 62%; Fig. 2E]).Sensitivity analysisTo account for clinical heterogeneity (e.g. study populations and interventions trialled), a leave-one-out sensitivity analysis was conducted for the above outcomes (Supplementary Table 5). Exclusion of Samelson only resulted in an overall significant reduction in AAC. Exclusion of any study except Hill resulted in an overall significant reduction in CAC-volume. Exclusion of any study except Hill resulted in an overall significant reduction in CAC-Hu (Geers et al. (denosumab users) and Geers et al. (alendronate users)) and overall significant increase in AVA-AS. Exclusion of Skolnick only resulted in an overall significant increase in EF.DiscussionIn this systematic review and meta-analysis, we attempted to evaluate whether anti-resorptive medications could influence the incidence or progression of various measures of vascular and valvular calcification. We demonstrated that there was significant, small favourable effect on AVA and non-significant, small favourable effects on AAC, CAC (volume), CAC (Hu) and EF associated with anti-resorptive use. A recent review also concluded that there is currently insufficient evidence to support the correlation between anti-resorptive use and CAC which we have again demonstrated but have extended on these previous findings by quantifying the putative association and inclusion of a broader range of indications to explore whether specific indications influence the overall outcome [9]. Taken together, these results indicate that the putative mechanisms that have been hypothesised to link vascular calcification with osteoporosis may be acting in pathways not influenced by anti-resorptives. Therefore, it could be speculated that interventions that target the shared causative pathways of both osteoporosis and vascular calcification (such as smoking, inflammation) may be more likely to yield favourable effects on both outcomes. While there is a small magnitude positive effect of anti-resorptive use on aortic stenosis, the clinical significance is still uncertain.It should be noted that we did demonstrate small, significant favourable effects on AVA and small, non-significant favourable effects on AAC, CAC (volume), CAC (Hu) and EF. The small number of studies and patients enrolled in the included studies possibly account for the weak findings and one may speculate that inclusion of further and larger trials may alter outcomes and thus further research is warranted to explore this possibility.In the case of bisphosphonates (which accounts for the majority of included trials), there is plausible biological evidence for them having favourable effects on vascular calcification. Bisphosphonates inhibit the farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase enzyme which acts downstream of HMG-CoA reductase in the malonate pathway of cholesterol synthesis [47]. Statins (inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase) have well described effects on reducing plaque burden and clinical outcomes; thus, it is assumed that bisphosphonates would deliver similar benefit. Indeed, a secondary analysis of a large fracture reduction trial demonstrated reduced myocardial infarction mortality in those treated with zoledronate [48]. However, the results of our meta-analysis and previous meta-analysis of statins on calcification outcomes do not support this as the mechanism [49–51]. We observed a subtle difference in the effect of anti-resorptives on CAC versus AAC, where the effect was more pronounced in CAC. This could possibly reflect a small study effect (epiphenomenon). However, further analysis was done focusing on the effect of etidronate also showed a more positive effect in CAC. As etidronate is a non-nitrogen-containing-bisphosphonate, the main mode of action is slightly different—interfere with the mitochondrial adenosine diphosphate (ADP)/adenosine triphosphate (ATP) translocase [52]. However, during the process, it binds to hydroxyapatite crystals which helps in ectopic mineralisation that potentially reducing vascular and valvular calcification [34]. It has also been shown to reduce arterial calcification in patients with pseudoxanthoma elasticum [34, 53]. Furthermore, in a trial examining etidronate in thoracic and abdominal plaques, there appeared to be differential effects of the bisphosphonate on these sites [26]. Etidronate appeared to reduce abdominal plaques (distal vessel) but have little impact on thoracic plaques (proximal). We speculate that a similar phenomenon may be occurring, albeit with the associations reversed. That is to say, more proximal vessels such as the coronary vessels are being favourably altered, while the distal vessels such as the abdominal aorta are not. This could be related to the different vessel architecture/cellular constituents between the aorta and the coronaries and how bisphosphonates interact with them [54]. A separate analysis was also done to look at the effects of anti-resorptives on patients undergoing haemodialysis considering the extra-skeletal burden in CKD patients. Though insignificant, CAC was more favourable to anti-resorptives compared to AAC.We demonstrated small, non-significant effects on EF. EF is not a direct marker of vascular/valvular calcification but was included as an exploratory, hypothesis-generating endpoint as the calcific burden on valvular or coronary structures would negatively impact EF. Analysis of effects of anti-osteoporosis medications on ejection fraction is included opportunistically in the setting of our primary aim. We hypothesise that peripheral vascular calcification (e.g. AAC) would affect total peripheral resistance, augmenting afterload which may promote ventricular remodelling, ultimately resulting in dilated cardiomyopathy. As such, EF may be preserved in this instance, but may predispose to declines in EF in untreated disease (such as advancing atherosclerotic disease). Hence, any small effect of anti-resorptives on EF may thus be reflective of an overall mixed effect of differing homeostatic forces. There might be a small reduction in total peripheral vascular resistance that would occur from a reduced peripheral vascular calcification burden together with a preserved EF due to left ventricular hypertrophy and improved myocardial perfusion from reduced coronary calcification burden. It should be noted, however, that heart failure and ejection fraction itself have multiple aetiologies and contributing factors and this may account for why no meaningful change in response to anti-resorptive treatment (assumed to the reduce calcification) was observed.Our study also demonstrated small, significant favourable effects on change in aortic stenosis (there was a slower progression of valvular disease in patients on anti-resorptives compared with those who were not), but the clinical significance is uncertain. This reflects the possibility that anti-resorptives act on the same pathway and have the same effect on valvular and vascular calcification. Previous animal studies also showed that bisphosphonates were able to inhibit vascular and valvular calcification [55]. Interestingly, there is a recent case report of an older osteoporotic women experiencing rapid progression of previously very stable aortic stenosis after commencing an anabolic agent (a parathyroid hormone analogue), suggestive of direct mineral metabolism effect on the pathophysiology of valvular calcification [56]. PTH results in increased renin secretion, reactive-oxygen species production and endothelin levels which could all result in hypertension and induce valvular stiffening, contributing to valvular calcification [57].Previous meta-analyses on this topic had showed differing findings. Meta-analyses in 2016 and 2017 demonstrated that bisphosphonates were able to reduce arterial wall calcification. Kranenburg further found that bisphosphonates were also able to reduce the risk of cardiovascular mortality and all-cause mortality [58, 59]. In our meta-analysis, we revealed that anti-resorptive therapy provided significant, small favourable effects on AVA and non-significant, small favourable effects on AAC, CAC (volume), CAC (Hu) and EF. This contrasts with the meta-analyses mentioned. More clinical trials with a long follow-up period need to be conducted to reasonably conclude the role of anti-resorptive therapy in vascular calcification—further understanding the relationship between anti-resorptive therapy and valvular/vascular calcification may allow clinicians to better tailor osteoporosis therapies to individual patient risk factors and comorbidities, particularly those pertaining to valvular/vascular calcification.While our review focused mainly on anti-resorptive medications, there has been ongoing discussions about the utility of vitamin D and its role in vascular calcification. In fact, vitamin D and CVDs have a U-shaped association between them [60, 61]. With insufficient vitamin D, it triggers a pro-inflammatory reaction which causes stress on the endothelium, leading to calcification or through inhibition of vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) into osteoclast-like cells [60, 61]. Excessive vitamin D instead causes calcification through differentiation of VSMC into osteoblast-like cells or with concomitant increases in calcium and phosphate [60, 61]. Hence, the biphasic actions of vitamin D make it especially vital to ensure patients have a healthy level of vitamin D to prevent vascular calcification and CVDs.Our study has some limitations. Despite inclusion of many studies (33), only 15 of the papers had data included in the final meta-analysis totalling 2344 patients. Therefore, there is potentially a large amount of un-analysed, already published data and so overall findings are incomplete from this perspective. We urge and encourage custodians of these data to consider reporting on these outcomes. Also, the relatively small sample size of our data analysis may not be entirely reflective of the total population using anti-resorptives that may be at risk of vascular/valvular calcification. The wide confidence intervals of our results confirm this probable data limitation. In addition, as we placed no restrictions on study populations, our study extracted data from a heterogeneous cohorts (for example, pseudoxanthoma elasticum). This could potentially skew our dataset as different populations could have different risk factors that put them at increased risk of osteoporosis or valvular/vascular calcification or indeed have differing responses to anti-resorptives. However, we believe that inclusion of this diversity of cohorts only serves to increase the generalisability of our findings. Another further limitation was the heterogeneity of outcomes included. As there are few studies published that directly address the topic of anti-resorptive effects on valvular/vascular calcification in randomised settings, we collected a variety of outcomes that could be considered subclinical markers of valvular/vascular calcification in an effort to collect as much relevant data as possible. Random effects models were employed in an attempt to overcome this heterogeneity which generates conservative estimates. Some of the data collected were used for secondary analyses to affirm the primary outcomes that were statistically significant. For instance, EF was reported as an exploratory endpoint which had a non-significant small increase. This may be due to the vastly differing aetiologies of heart failure that are not directly related to extra skeletal calcification. There was also substantial heterogeneity in the outcomes for and changes in AAC, CAC (volume), CAC-Hu (Geers et al. (denosumab users) and Geers et al. (alendronate users)) and AVA (tau2 = 0.33, 2.96, 2.49, 0.784 and 0.18, respectively). We also performed leave-one-out sensitivity analyses to explore small study effects and indication specific effects. Furthermore, some of the published papers had missing data that we were unable to collect. For example, some of the standard deviations (SDs) had to be imputed based on the mean of the studies included in the analysis. Data on the background of patients with osteoporosis were also limited. Hence, future studies could aim to include relevant information such as DEXA measurements, previous fractures and use of vitamin D or calcium, so that a deeper analysis could be undertaken to look at risk factors or any potential new associations linking risk factors, anti-resorptive medications and valvular/vascular calcification. Lastly, the follow-up of patients included in the analyses was relatively short, ranging from 6 months to 2 years. As calcification is a long and slow process that takes several years, the data obtained from these studies could potentially lead to misleading results. Different studies also used differing methods of measurement for calcification which may have a big measurement error in comparison with real changes that occur in the human body.In conclusion, this systematic review and meta-analysis identified non-significant, marginal effects of osteoporosis medications on markers of vascular calcification and significant, marginal effects of osteoporosis medications on valvular calcification; but studies were limited by small sample sizes, short follow-up durations, heterogeneous populations and outcome reported limiting interpretation about whether a true effect can be seen. Given significant biological evidence for osteoporosis mechanisms being involved in extra-skeletal calcification, our data would do well to be corroborated in future trials with larger sample size with longer follow-up times in cohorts representative of those taking osteoporosis medications and at risk of valvular/vascular calcification.Supplementary InformationBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material.Supplementary file1 (DOCX 1182 KB)"}

In this NMA, the four ablations all significantly reduced the risk of recurrent AF compared with AADs, with no significant differences [RFA: risk ratio (RR) =0.503, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.423–0.594; CBA: RR =0.465, 95% CI: 0.370–0.579; LBA: RR =0.522, 95% CI: 0.306–0.891; SA: RR =0.664, 95% CI: 0.392–1.12]. CBA and SA groups may be associated with more adverse events than AAD groups (CBA: RR =1.462, 95% CI: 0.956–2.283; SA: RR =2.054, 95% CI: 0.999–4.369). RFA appeared to reduce all-cause mortality compared to AADs (RR =0.745, 95% CI: 0.552–1.014). CBA took the shortest time to complete compared to the other three ablations.ConclusionsCatheter ablation (CA) and SA are equally effective and superior to AADs. However, SA has a high risk of complications, while compared with AADs, no evidence indicates that RFA and SA significantly reduce the risk of mortality.", "body": "Highlight boxKey findings• Catheter ablation (CA) and surgical ablation (SA) more effectively reduce atrial fibrillation (AF) recurrence than antiarrhythmic drugs. CA has a lower complication rate, while SA carries a higher risk of adverse events. Additionally, no evidence indicates that radiofrequency ablation and SA significantly reduce the risk of mortality.What is known and what is new?• CA has become the first-line treatment for paroxysmal AF and symptomatic persistent AF.• Among various CAs, cryoablation has the shortest procedure time, radiofrequency ablation may lower all-cause mortality rate, while SA is associated with more complications.What is the implication, and what should change now?• Clinicians should prioritize CA for the treatment of AF, especially for patients at higher risk of recurrence. Future research is needed to refine the evidence and guidelines for personalized treatment.IntroductionAtrial fibrillation (AF), the most prevalent sustained cardiac arrhythmia, afflicts approximately 1–2% of the global population (1). It is estimated that by 2050, around 6–12 million individuals in the US (2) and by 2060, 17.9 million individuals in Europe (3) will suffer from this condition. AF is a progressive disease (4), and its progression is associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction, thromboembolism, acute heart failure, and stroke, leading to considerable morbidity and mortality if these complications are left inadequately managed (5-7).At present, three primary modalities are available for managing AF: catheter ablation (CA), surgical ablation (SA), and antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs). Although drug therapy remains the mainstay treatment for AF, its limited efficacy and potential side effects present significant challenges. The latest European guidelines (8) have endorsed CA, which includes radiofrequency ablation (RFA), cryoablation (CBA), laser balloon ablation (LBA), as the first-line therapy for paroxysmal AF (PAF), drug-refractory AF, and symptomatic AF. Furthermore, accumulating evidence has demonstrated the superiority of CA over AADs in preventing AF recurrence (9-11). Interestingly, Pokushalov et al. (12) found that SA outperformed CA in maintaining sinus rhythm in patients with PAF and persistent AF (PersAF) who had experienced failure with initial CA treatment.As a result, the investigation of CA for individuals with AF remains a hotly debated topic for many scientists. Although several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been carried out on ClinicalTrials.gov (such as NCT04612244, NCT05534581, NCT03920917, and NCT04877327), there is still no consensus on the optimal ablation technique for patients with AF. Therefore, we conducted this comprehensive analysis and Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of different ablation methods and AADs. We present this article in accordance with the PRISMA-NMA reporting checklist (available at https://jtd.amegroups.com/article/view/10.21037/jtd-24-1545/rc) (13).MethodsStudy design and registrationAs the NMA relies on previously published data, ethical clearance or consent to participate is not deemed necessary. The study’s methodology was duly registered on PROSPERO, with the registration number CRD42022371798.Eligibility criteria and type of interventionsRCTs were included for systematic review if they compared CA and AADs or evaluated the efficacy of two or more ablation techniques for treating adult patients with AF (PAF and PersAF). Additionally, these trials were followed up for at least 3 months. RCTs investigating patients who underwent previous ablation procedures such as catheter, surgical, or atrioventricular node ablation were deemed not eligible for review.Search strategyWe systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases for RCTs published from the inception of the abovementioned databases to October 19, 2022. To avoid the risk of omission of newly published literature, we conducted additional searches of the databases on December 15, 2024. The search was conducted utilizing subject terms together with free words, without any restrictions on geographical area or language. A listing of the search terms and strategies employed can be found in Appendix 1. Additionally, our analysis exclusively considered publicly accessible RCTs or parallel controlled trials.Literature screeningRetrieved studies were imported into Endnote to remove duplicates. The remaining studies were screened by reading the titles and abstracts. Then, the potentially eligible studies were reviewed by reading the full texts. Two investigators (Q.C. and X.X.) independently screened the studies obtained from databases. Any disagreement between them was resolved by discussion with a third member of the investigator team (L.L.).Data extractionA standard data extraction table was drawn before we started to extract data, including the characteristics of included RCTs [study title, first author, study region, National Clinical Trial (NCT) number, year of publication, sample size, intervention strategy, follow-up duration] and the characteristics of participants [mean age, gender, type of AF, duration of AF, body mass index (BMI), left atrium diameter, left ventricular ejection fraction, blanking period, outcome indicators]. Two investigators (Q.C. and X.X.) independently extracted the data and the results were then cross-checked. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion with a third investigator (L.L.) to reach a consensus.OutcomesPrimary outcomesEfficacyThe primary endpoint was the duration from the completion of treatment to the first recurrence of symptomatic or asymptomatic atrial tachyarrhythmia [AF, atrial flutter (AFL), or atrial tachycardia (AT)] as determined by any form of monitoring methods including implantable loop recorder, pacemaker, defibrillator, electrocardiogram (ECG), or ambulatory-ECG, during a minimum follow-up period of 6 months after CA. An atrial tachyarrhythmia lasting no less than 30 seconds was considered an arrhythmia. To account for early AF recurrences, a standard 90-day blanking period was applied.SafetyThe primary safety endpoint was the total number of all-cause deaths, cerebrovascular events, or serious treatment-related adverse events during the periprocedural period or throughout the follow-up.Secondary outcomesThe prespecified secondary endpoints reported in this review included procedure time and fluoroscopy time.Risk of bias assessmentTwo researchers (Q.C. and X.X.) used the RCT risk of bias assessment tool from the Cochrane Collaboration Network to assess the risk of bias across included studies. The following parameters were considered for study quality assessment: generation of random sequences, allocation concealment, blinding of subjects and intervention providers, blinding of outcome evaluators, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other sources of bias. A study was rated as having low, high, or unclear risk of bias regarding each of the abovementioned parameters.Statistical analysisA Bayesian random-effects model was employed to compare the effectiveness of various therapies for AF. After 50,000 simulation cycles, the modeling was finished using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method with four chains run in parallel and an annealing number of 20,000. In the event of a closed-loop mesh, the node splitting method was employed to evaluate local consistency, and the model fitting and global consistency were assessed using the deviation information criteria (DIC). Additionally, league tables were constructed to compare the effects of different intervention modalities, and a surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) was used to rate the interventions. Data analyses were performed using the software Stata 16.0 (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA) and R 4.2.3 (R Development Core Team, Vienna, Austria; http://www.rproject.org). Statistical significance was considered to be P<0.05.ResultsLiterature searchFigure 1 illustrates the selection process for RCTs included in this review. The initial literature search yielded 4,812 articles that were potentially relevant to our research. After a thorough review of their titles and abstracts, 1,948 articles were excluded, leaving 2,864 trials for further evaluation. Upon further examination, 2,744 articles were excluded after reviewing their full text, resulting in 63 RCTs that met the predefined inclusion criteria involving 17,522 patients for further analysis.Figure 1Flow diagram of study selection.Characteristics of included studiesAppendices 2,3 show the baseline characteristics and references for each study.Quality assessmentOf the 63 RCTs, 27 did not provide a specific description of the random sequence generation, while four clearly indicated that treatment allocation was concealed. Given that CA requires informed consent before the procedures, it is not feasible to blind participants and personnel in practice. Regarding the blinding aspect, the comparator was medical therapy, so it was not possible to achieve blinding. Blinding would be feasible when two different energy sources are used in CA. Regarding detection bias, nine studies explicitly outlined protocols for blinding outcome assessment. All RCTs were judged as not having a risk of attrition bias or reporting bias. The quality assessment results are presented in Figure 2 and Appendix 4.Figure 2Study quality assessment results.Primary outcomesAF recurrenceThe clinical outcome of AF recurrence was reported in 54 RCTs, which involved RFA, CBA, LBA, SA and AADs. Among them, RFA, CBA and AADs were the main measures used in most studies (Figure 3A). A random-effect model was employed. Analysis results showed that RFA [risk ratio (RR) =0.503, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.423–0.594], CBA (RR =0.465, 95% CI: 0.370–0.579), LBA (RR =0.522, 95% CI: 0.306–0.891), and SA (RR =0.664, 95% CI: 0.392–1.12) all significantly reduced the risk of recurrent AF compared with AADs (Figure 3B), with no significant differences between ablation modalities regarding the risk of AF recurrence (Table 1). The ranking results showed CBA > LBA > RFA > SA > AADs (Figure 3C). Although the duration of follow-up for AF recurrence varied amongst trials, the meta-regression based on NMA revealed no correlation between follow-up duration and AF recurrence (Table 2). Moreover, we observed notable discrepancies in the risk of relapse between the PAF and PersAF cohorts, with the latter exhibiting a marginally increased risk. Thus, we conducted a subgroup analysis based on the study follow-up duration (Appendix 5) and the type of AF (Appendix 6).Figure 3Network meta-analysis of AF recurrence risk with different treatments.

Lines signify direct comparisons between interventions, where line thickness represents the number of such comparative studies, and a thicker line indicates more direct comparisons. (B) This shows the effect estimates (RR) and corresponding 95% CIs of different ablation vs. antiarrhythmic drugs for AF recurrence. The central square represents the effect estimate, sized by study weight. If the interval overlaps the vertical no-effect line (RR =1), no significant difference exists; the line on the left indicates reduced recurrence risk; the line on the right suggests increased risk. (C) This figure illustrates the probability distribution of different interventions (AADs, CBA, LBA, RFA, SA) under a certain outcome. The horizontal axis represents the various interventions, while the vertical axis represents the probability values (probability), ranging from 0 to 0.8. The columns in different colors in the figure represent the ranking situations of best (black), second (dark gray), third (light gray), fourth (lighter gray), and worst (white) respectively. From left to right, darker color potentially implies a better ranking of the treatment in reducing the risk of AF recurrence.

Among them, RFA, CBA, and AADs were the main measures used in most studies (Figure 4A). A random-effect model was employed. The results of our NMA indicated that SA (RR =2.054, 95% CI: 0.999–4.369) may increase the risk of adverse events compared with AADs, but RFA (RR =0.917, 95% CI: 0.674–1.261) and LBA (RR =0.93, 95% CI: 0.358–2.46) were not associated increased risk of adverse events compared with AADs, with RR=1.462 (95% CI: 0.956–2.283) for CBA (Figure 4B), and there was no significant difference between ablation groups regarding the risk of adverse events (Table 3). The performance ranking results showed LBA > RFA > AADs > CBA > SA (Figure 4C).Figure 4Network meta-analysis of adverse events risk after AF different treatments.

In most studies, RFA and AADs were predominantly used (Figure 5A). Among the 108 patients who underwent SA, there were three RCTs. Random-effect models were employed. RFA (RR =0.745, 95% CI: 0.552–1.014) and SA (RR =0.777, 95% CI: 0.198–3.18) were not associated with reduced risk of adverse events compared with AADs (Figure 5B), and no significant difference emerged between RFA and SA groups in all-cause mortality (Table 4). The performance ranking showed RFA > SA > AADs (Figure 5C). The results of secondary outcomes (procedure duration and fluoroscopy time) were shown in Appendices 7,8.Figure 5Network meta-analysis of all-cause mortality risk after AF different treatments.

The following are the key findings: (I) both CA and SA were found to reduce post-operative AF recurrence compared with AADs, irrespective of the duration of follow-up; (II) SA may be associated with a higher risk of adverse events; (III) compared to AADs, no evidence showed that RFA and SA notably decreased the mortality risk; and (IV) CBA took the shortest time to perform.RFA vs. CBA vs. LBAThe present meta-analysis compared the efficacy of RFA, CBA, and LBA as initial treatments for AF. The analysis was based on 21 RFA vs. CBA, three RFA vs. LBA, and two CBA vs. LBA RCTs. The results revealed that three ablation techniques showed comparable efficacy, irrespective of AF type and follow-up time. However, CBA took the shortest time to complete, although no significant difference was observed in terms of fluoroscopy time.Several meta-analyses have investigated the efficacy and safety of CBA and RFA in different AF populations. In the PAF cohort (14), PersAF cohort (15), and both PAF and PersAF cohort (16), these three meta-analyses investigating diverse populations of AF types have demonstrated that both CBA and RFA exhibit equivalent efficacy and safety, with CBA taking a shorter time to perform. Another meta-analysis by Wei et al. (17) showed that there was no statistically significant difference in atrial arrhythmia recurrence between LBA vs. CBA at 12 months [RR (95% CI): 0.91 (0.64–1.28), P=0.59], but LBA tended to be more effective than CBA in PAF patients [RR (95% CI): 0.70 (0.47–1.03), P=0.07]. The latest NMA by Zhao et al. (18) reported no significant difference in the incidence of major adverse events among different ablation modalities. These findings are consistent with the results of our NMA. Noteworthy, Ravi, Wei, and Kim’s studies (15-17) primarily included observational studies, while Murray’s study (14) was limited to only four RCTs, and Zhao’s study (18) only focused on the safety aspect and did not compare the effectiveness of various ablation methods and drug treatments for AF. Therefore, the latter study may have been affected by selection bias and other study design confounders.RFA has advantages over CBA and LBA due to its flexibility and accessibility to non-pulmonary vein targets such as the posterior wall and roof ablation lines. CBA is a standardized and single-shot procedure that achieves efficient pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) using hypothermia for which CBA can only be performed once per vein, and its success rate is generally high [approximately 93% in the STOP-AF trial (19)]. However, when CBA fails to isolate the pulmonary veins, additional RFA may be necessary, particularly in the inferior pulmonary veins. This presents a challenge for CBA (20). Compared to CBA and RFA, LBA utilizes a miniature endoscope allowing for segment-by-segment ablation, enabling a more precise ablation of the targets (21).The above-mentioned three ablation methods present varying degrees of risk for complications. RFA carries the risk of cardiac perforation and tamponade due to tissue overheating, whereas LBA and CBA can cause phrenic nerve palsy due to the expansion of the balloon and consequent malformation of the right upper lobe venous system, thereby reducing the distance from the phrenic nerve (22). Paralysis is rare and most individuals recover before discharge. Our study confirmed previous findings by revealing no significant difference in adverse events associated with RFA, LBA, and CBA (14,16). Over the last decade, CA techniques have reduced complications due to a shorter learning curve, the use of contact pressure catheters, more precise septal penetration with intracardiac echocardiography, and safer procedures with real-time monitoring of intraoperative pericardial effusion.CA vs. SAThe results of our study suggest that although SA and CA are similarly effective in treating AF, SA is associated with more complications than CA. Phan et al. (23) conducted a meta-analysis that revealed SA was more effective than CA in reducing arrhythmias in patients on and off AAD at 6- and 12-month follow-up. Similarly, the meta-analysis by Rattanawong et al. (24) demonstrated that SA resulted in higher freedom from AF, higher pacemaker placement rates, and equivalent rates of neurological sequelae and cardiac tamponade compared to CA. However, it is important to note that these studies included case-control and cohort studies, which can lead to highly heterogeneous results and therefore undermine the credibility of the results. Two additional meta-analyses (25,26) that exclusively included RCTs revealed that SA led to a higher success rate compared to CA. However, these studies focused on recurring patients who had previously undergone unsuccessful CA, rather than using it as an initial treatment, which conflicts with our study’s inclusion criteria and hence yielded different results. Interestingly, Yi et al.’s report (27) showed that in the sub-analysis of patients with PAF or early PersAF, SA did not provide higher efficacy results than the initial invasive procedure, which is in line with our findings.The aforementioned discrepancies in the treatment of AF can be attributed to two factors. On the one hand, traditional CA is often effective for PAF and early PersAF (defined as PersAF less than 3 months), which may obviate the need for a more invasive SA. However, it should be noted that if CA fails, SA can serve as a valuable alternative with demonstrated efficacy. On the other hand, for patients with long-standing PersAF or refractory AF with valvular problems, initial treatment with CA is likely to be ineffective. In such cases, SA may be a better treatment when. This may be explained by inherent differences in SA and CA techniques. Unlike CA, SA technique includes a greater variety of ablative lesions. Thoracoscopic SA includes PVI identical to CA, as well as epicardial ganglion plexus, left auricular resection, and additional left auricular line, Marshall’s ligament resection (12,28-30). Several studies (31,32) suggest that the ganglion plexus may be one of the substrates that perpetuate the AF refractory loop. Hence, removing these autonomic stimuli may reduce the incidence of arrhythmias. Similarly, left auricular has been identified as the trigger site in 27% of AF patients, and its removal may also contribute to AF freedom (33). According to Rodríguez-Mañero et al. (34), the vein of Marshall is a promising site for CA of AF since it has innervation, myocardial connections, and arrhythmogenic foci. In contrast, the point-by-point ablation performed by CA at the endocardium leaves patients susceptible to potential PV reconnection and AF recurrence.SA is seldom utilized due to the significant risk of surgical adverse effects associated with it (28). The latest guidelines recommend SA in conjunction with surgical repair of other structural cardiac diseases (particularly mitral valve disease), whereas SA alone is usually not accepted as a primary treatment until CA has failed (8). A meta-analysis conducted by Phan et al. (23) revealed that rates of major complications were 3.5 times greater in the SA group than in the CA cohort, with higher rates of intraoperative pleural effusion and pneumothorax. These complications may be attributed to mechanical injury caused by pulmonary deflation during the procedure and damage to nearby pleural structures during epicardial ablation of the beating heart. With the improvement in SA techniques, thoracoscopic SA is now frequently performed without the need for open-heart exposure (29,30). However, small incisions to create ports for the endoscope and bipolar ablation forceps, as well as lung deflation are required to allow surgical access to epicardial pulsatile heart lesions. Furthermore, the shorter learning curve of CA compared to SA is one reason why there are higher rates of complications with SA. The application of ablation index, three-dimensional (3D) scaler systems, intra-cardiac ultrasonography, and visualization sheaths have also contributed to reducing the occurrence of adverse occurrences associated with CA.LimitationIn the present study, a Bayesian NMA was conducted to examine 65 RCTs. Several limitations in this study must be considered. First, certain single-center studies with relatively low quality and small sample sizes were not excluded to ensure the inclusion of all relevant research. Although our NMA aimed to integrate the additional uncertainty associated with bias generated by multiple study designs, the capacity to estimate genuine effects may be constrained by the limited number of high-quality studies in the network. Second, this study compared four ablation techniques and pharmacological therapy, but some of the catheters initially used, such as non-contact pressure or non-saline irrigated RFA, LBA, and first-generation CBA, are not commonly used and may be susceptible to publication bias, as newer techniques are typically superior to established ones. Third, although the quality of the included studies is adequate, certain factors may have led to bias. For example, it was not possible to blind patients and operators, there were differences in operator experience and habits across cardiac centers, and the use of anti-arrhythmias after the blanking period varied. Fourth, although 63 studies were included, only 11 involved long-term follow-up and examined the effect of RFA and SA on all-cause mortality compared with AADs. The limited number of such studies might constrain the results. Hence, future research should perform further long-term follow-up on patients undergoing different ablation methods to determine whether these methods can reduce the mortality risk. Furthermore, the data are inconsistent in terms of endpoint definitions, follow-up durations, and arrhythmia recurrence monitoring protocols. Last, it should be noted that NMAs have an inherent limitation. The network graph reveals indirect measurements, which entail comparisons between groups that are not directly reported in published studies. However, neither the extent nor the number of these indirect measurements was specified in the original manuscript. The ambiguity of indirect comparisons may affect the interpretation and generalizability of our results, given the potentially variable reliability of such indirect evidence.ConclusionsThe efficacy and safety outcomes of several CA and SA approaches were comparable, and there is inadequate evidence to conclude that one strategy is preferable to another. Among the evaluated methods, CBA took the shortest time to perform, but it was associated with a somewhat high incidence of complications. Moreover, compared to AADs, no evidence shows that RFA and SA notably decrease the mortality risk. To make an informed decision about selecting a suitable ablation modality, some factors need to be considered, such as the expertise, skill, and habits of electrophysiologists, as well as the patient’s clinical condition and financial circumstances.SupplementaryThe article’s supplementary files as10.21037/jtd-24-154510.21037/jtd-24-154510.21037/jtd-24-1545"}
{"PMCID": "11815325", "title": "Treatment of Myeloproliferative Neoplasms With Janus Kinase Inhibitors: A Meta‐Analysis of Cardiovascular Safety", "abstract": "ABSTRACTBackgroundJanus kinase inhibitors (JAKis) are an integral aspect of the management of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). Part of the clinical benefit derived from JAKis may be due to reductions in thrombosis, a potentially life‐threatening complication of MPNs. However, evidence has emerged of adverse cardiovascular effects secondary to JAKis. We conducted a first‐of‐a‐kind meta‐analysis of the cardiovascular safety of JAKis in the treatment of MPNs.MethodsThis study was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analysis (PRISMA). Systematic searches for studies comparing JAKi treatment to a control group were conducted. Studies reporting hypertension, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and thromboembolic events were included in a meta‐analysis using a random‐effects model for the primary analysis, and fixed‐effects model for any subgroup analyses performed.ResultsA total of 23 publications, consisting of nine clinical trials and one retrospective analysis, met the inclusion criteria. This resulted in a pooled population of 2198 patients (JAKi n = 1145, Control n = 1053). In studies reporting thromboembolic events (n = 9), pooled analysis revealed a significantly lower rate of thromboembolic events in the JAKi group (incidence rate ratio (IRR): 0.52, 95% CI: 0.28–0.98, p = 0.04). This was primarily driven by ruxolitinib studies in myelofibrosis (MF) and polycythemia vera (PV) as when a subgroup analysis of these trials was performed (n = 7), an even more significant reduction in thromboembolic events with JAKi treatment was found (IRR: 0.41, 95%CI: 0.26–0.64, p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in MACE or hypertension between JAKi and control groups.ConclusionThis meta‐analysis suggests that JAKi treatment of MPN was associated with a reduced risk of thromboembolic events; primarily driven by studies of ruxolitinib in PV and MF. Further prospective clinical trials are warranted to confirm these findings and characterise the cardiovascular profile of other JAKis and other types of MPNs.", "body": "1IntroductionMyeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs)—the main subtypes of which are polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET) and myelofibrosis (MF)—are a group of haematological malignancies characterised by the constitutive activation of the Janus kinase (JAK) / signal transducer and transcription activator protein (STAT) pathway in clonal myeloid precursors. [1].JAK inhibitors (JAKis), first approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2011 for the treatment of adults with MF, are a cornerstone of the management of MPNs. Of the four JAKis which have completed phase three trials—ruxolitinib, pacritinib, fedratinib and momelotinib—large studies such as COMFORT, MAJIC‐PV, PERSIST and MOMENTUM have demonstrated these medications to be effective in improving outcomes in MF and PV, with mixed results in ET [2, 3, 4, 5]. However, there have been observed increases in body weight and cholesterol levels [6] secondary to JAKis, both key risk factors for cardiovascular disease [7]. Moreover, the PERSIST‐2 clinical trial was terminated prematurely due to concerns over interim survival results showing increases in bleeding and cardiovascular events in the JAKi arm [8].Previously, the primary endpoint for clinical trials in MF and PV has been control of symptoms, spleen size and haematocrit. However, thrombosis is a relatively common and potentially life‐threatening complication associated with MPNs [9]. Hence, it is important to understand the impact of JAKi treatment on thrombotic risk. A meta‐analysis including 750 patients by Samuelson et al. found rates of thrombosis were significantly lower among patients treated with ruxolitinib (risk ratio (RR) 0.45, 95% CI 0.23–0.88) compared to control [10].There is evidence that the use of JAKis may increase the rate of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs)—a composite measure of cardiovascular adverse events frequently used in clinical trials. The ORAL Surveillance trial investigating the safety of the JAKi tofacitinib for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [11] concluded that JAKi treatment was associated with an increased risk of MACE and did not meet non‐inferiority criteria, leading to the addition of a boxed warning on all JAKis used for the treatment of inflammatory conditions. This safety analysis of JAKi in RA was prompted by several studies [12, 13] illustrating that JAKi treatment in RA was associated with increases in cholesterol and lipid levels. Moreover, a large meta‐analysis of 126,961 patients with immune‐mediated inflammatory disorders found JAKi treatment to be associated with a higher risk of MACE compared to control [14].Here we report a first‐of‐a‐kind meta‐analysis of the cardiovascular safety of JAKis in the treatment of MPNs. We aim to compare the rates of both arterial and venous thrombosis, MACE and hypertension [7]—another key risk factor for cardiovascular disease—in MPN patients treated with JAKi compared to those treated with best available therapy (BAT), or placebo, and comment on the clinical significance of cardiovascular safety in this group of patients.2Methods2.1Search StrategyThis systematic review and meta‐analysis were carried out in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) [15]. Ethical approval from an institutional review board was not required as this is a retrospective trial‐level meta‐analysis. Systematic searches were conducted in PubMed, Ovid Embase, Ovid MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library from inception to February 1, 2024. Medical Education Subject Headings and key terms were combined with Boolean operators to retrieve publications investigating the treatment of MPNs with JAKis that reported cardiovascular adverse events (AEs) included in the primary outcomes. Publicly available data from clinicaltrials.gov was used to supplement AE event rates reported in publications.2.2Inclusion and Exclusion CriteriaWe included clinical trials and cohort studies, both prospective and retrospective, which compared a JAKi to a control group which did not include a JAKi. Single‐arm studies, conference reports and systematic reviews were excluded. To meet the inclusion criteria, any outcome of MACE, thrombosis or hypertension had to be reported in either the full manuscript, its corresponding supplementary material or on clinicaltrials.gov.2.3OutcomesThe primary outcomes were the incidence of (1) thromboembolic events, (2) MACE or (3) hypertension. MACE was defined as a composite of cerebrovascular events, myocardial infarction (MI), cardiac arrest and heart failure. If no overall figure was reported for thromboembolic events then a composite of MI, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), portal vein thrombosis, splenic infarction, thrombophlebitis and thrombosis was calculated. In studies where only certain components of MACE or thromboembolic events were reported, the composite was calculated using the available adverse event data reported in manuscripts, Supporting Information and clinicaltrials.gov. These can be found in Tables S1 and S2.2.4Study Selection and ExtractionTwo reviewers (R.D. and E.L.) independently screened titles and abstracts for eligibility and discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Publications were then screened for final selection based on the selection criteria. Where several publications reported on the same study population, only data from the most recent record which reported adverse events of interest was included. Expert opinion (L.L.G, C.H., Y.Y and J.O.) was then sought to identify extra studies for inclusion. In cases where crossover was allowed, the crossover group was not included in the cumulative event rate calculation to mitigate the impact of recent JAKi treatment on our results. Data were then extracted and collated into an electronic database. The methodological quality of the included trials was evaluated using the Cochrane Risk‐of‐bias Tool 2 [13] for randomised controlled trials and the ROBINS‐I [14] checklist for non‐randomised study designs.2.5Statistical AnalysisFor each primary outcome, incidence rates were calculated as event rate per 100 patient‐years. This was calculated by dividing the total number of events by the total patient exposure time, in 100y units. In cases where patient‐year exposure time was not reported, this was calculated by multiplying the number of patients with the median length of follow‐up for a given arm.Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using a random effects model, with heterogeneity assessed using I\n2 and Cochran's Q indices. A random‐effects model was used in favour of a fixed‐effects model for the primary analysis, due to the heterogeneity of MPNs and JAKis in the included studies. Subgroup analyses of the same JAKi were pooled with a fixed‐effects model. Heterogeneity was categorised as low (I\n2 < 30%), moderate (I\n2 = 30%–60%) or high (I\n2 > 60%); significant moderate heterogeneity (p < 0.05) prompted sensitivity analyses by excluding individual studies to identify sources of heterogeneity. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. All statistical analyses were performed using R version 4.4.0 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).3ResultsUsing the search strategy described above, 1519 publications were identified (Pubmed = 850, Cochrane Library = 69, MEDLINE = 60, Embase = 540). A total of 252 papers were duplicates which were removed before screening. Following screening of the title and abstract against the pre‐defined selection criteria, 1225 further publications were excluded. A full‐text review of 42 publications, alongside 4 additional publications identified through expert opinion, was undertaken yielding 23 publications meeting the inclusion criteria. After taking the most recent publication for manuscripts which reported on the same population of individuals, nine clinical trials and one retrospective analysis were included in the meta‐analysis (Figure 1). Risk‐of‐bias analysis was conducted for all ten studies, revealing nine studies with low bias and one study with moderate bias (Figures S1 and S2). It is worth noting that numerous large trials investigating JAKis in MPNs did not meet the inclusion criteria: the control group included JAKi in PERSIST‐1, SIMPLIFY‐1, SIMPLIFY‐2 and FREEDOM2; JAKARTA2 and FREEDOM were single‐arm studies; and JAKARTA did not publicly report any primary outcome data [16].FIGURE 1PRISMA flow diagram.3.1Study and Baseline CharacteristicsStudy and baseline characteristics are presented in Table 1. The studies enrolled a total of 2198 patients (JAKi n = 1145, Control n = 1053) to three JAKis: ruxolitinib (n = 8), pacritinib (n = 1) and momelotinib (n = 1). The MPNs included were MF (4 studies), ET (1 study) and PV (5 studies). Median age was similar for the two cohorts (JAKi: 66 years, control: 67 years) and the control cohort had a slightly higher proportion of male patients (JAKi: 53%, Control: 58%). Nine studies reported data on thromboembolic events, six studies reported data on hypertension and all studies reported data on MACE.TABLE 1Study and baseline characteristics.First author, year publishedStudy nameMPNJAKiComparator\na\n\nMedian age (y)Male (%)Patients (n)\nLength of\nfollow‐up (y)\nThromboembolic eventsHypertensionMACEJAKiControlJAKiControlJAKiControlJAKiControl\nVerstovsek,\n2017 [2]\nCOMFORT‐IMFRuxolitinibPlacebo667051571551512.860.71Y–Y\nHarrison,\n2016 [22]\nCOMFORT‐IIMFRuxolitinibBAT67665758146734.72.9YYY\nHarrison,\n2017 [5]\nMAJIC‐ETETRuxolitinibBAT6366384258572.612.61Y–Y\nMesa,\n2017 [23]\nRELIEFPVRuxolitinibHC64664461545611YYY\nMesa,\n2017 [4]\nPERSIST‐1MFPacritinibBAT676557562201061.931.95–YY\nKiladjian,\n2020 [24]\nRESPONSEPVRuxolitinibBAT626060711101113.890.66YYY\nPassamonti,\n2022 [25]\nRESPONSE‐2PVRuxolitinibBAT6367536374754.460.71YYY\nAlvarez‐Larrán,\n2022 [26]\n–PVRuxolitinibBAT717453491052722.394.68Y–Y\nVerstovsek,\n2023 [20]\nMOMENTUMMFMomelotinibDanazol71726168130650.300.51YYY\nHarrison,\n2023 [27]\nMAJIC‐PVPVRuxolitinibBAT6766605693874.84.8Y–Y\nNote: ‘–’ means not reported.Abbreviations: BAT: Best available therapy, ET: Essential thrombocytosis, HC: hydroxycarbamide, JAKi: Janus kinase inhibitor, MACE: Major cardiovascular adverse events, MF: Myelofibrosis, MPN: Myeloproliferative neoplasm, PV: Polycythemia vera.\na\nFor a detailed breakdown of comparators, please see Table S3.John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.3.2Thromboembolic EventsNine studies with a total of 1872 patients were included in the thrombosis analysis. A total of 950 patients received JAKis and 922 patients were in the control group. Studies included ruxolitinib (n = 8) and momelotinib (n = 1) in patients with PV (n = 5), MF (n = 3) and ET (n = 1). Average follow‐up was 3.08 years in the JAKi group and 1.74 years in the control group.In pooled analysis (Figure 2), there were significantly fewer thromboembolic events in the JAKi group compared to control (IRR: 0.52, 95% CI: 0.28‐0.98, p = 0.04) (I\n2 = 53.9%). This finding was primarily driven by ruxolitinib studies in MF and PV. When a subgroup analysis of these studies (n = 7) was performed, an even more significant reduction in thromboembolic events with JAKi treatment was found (IRR: 0.41, 95%CI: 0.26‐0.64 p < 0.001) (I\n2 = 27.4%) (Figure 3). Although the pooled analysis of all JAKis demonstrated high heterogeneity (I\n2 = 53.9%, p < 0.05), removal of MAJIC‐ET and MOMENTUM in the subgroup analysis drastically reduced the heterogeneity (I\n2 = 27.4%, p > 0.05).FIGURE 2Forest plot of all thromboembolic events comparing JAK inhibitor to control.

Studies encompassed ruxolitinib (n = 8), momelotinib (n = 1) and pacritinib (n = 1) in patients with PV (n = 5), MF (n = 4) and ET (n = 1). There was an average follow‐up of 2.89 years in the JAKi group and 2.05 years in the control group. In pooled analysis (Figure 4), there was no significant difference in the rate of MACE in patients treated with JAKi compared to control (IRR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.52–1.82, p = 0.93) (Figure 4). This analysis had a low heterogeneity (I\n2  = 8.8%), so no additional analysis was necessary.FIGURE 4Forest plot of MACE comparing JAK inhibitor to control.

A total of 734 patients received JAKi treatment and 486 patients received control treatment. Ruxolitinib (n = 4), pacritinib (n = 1) and momelotinib (n = 1) were all included in the analysis. There was an equal number of studies for MF (n = 3) and PV (n = 3). The JAKi and control group had an average follow‐up period of 2.61 and 1.14 years, respectively.There was no significant difference in hypertension associated with JAKis compared to control (IRR 0.81, 95%CI: 0.48‐1.35, p = 0.42) (Figure 5). This analysis had low heterogeneity (I\n2 = 11.3%), so no additional analysis was necessary.FIGURE 5Forest plot of hypertension comparing JAK inhibitor to control. JAK inhibitor—Janus kinase inhibitor, IRR—Incidence rate ratio, CI—Confidence interval, PY—Patient years at risk (in 100y).4DiscussionIn this meta‐analysis of the cardiovascular safety of JAKis in the treatment of MPNs including over 2000 patients over ten studies, our key findings are threefold: (1) JAKi treatment is associated with a significant reduction in thromboembolic event risk, primarily driven by studies of ruxolitinib in MF and PV. (2) JAKi treatment is not associated with an increase in MACE in patients with MPNs. (3) The risk of hypertension is not significantly increased by JAKi treatment in patients with MPNs.In a recent review of cardiovascular disease in MPNs, it has been postulated that there are four possible mechanisms for an increased propensity of thromboembolic events and cardiovascular disease more generally [6]. Inherent to MPNs, their effect on the numbers and function of numerous blood cells, including red blood cells and platelets, can interact and activate the coagulation pathway contributing to the risk of thrombosis. Secondly, the activation of the JAK/STAT signalling pathway at the centre of the pathogenesis of MPNs promotes the expression of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL‐6 and tumour necrosis factor‐alpha, which may themselves promote atherogenesis. Furthermore, the activation of these cytokines can lead to vascular injury and a pro‐thrombotic state due to their harmful effect on vascular endothelial cells [9]. Thirdly, increases in tumour growth factor beta and the enzyme lysyl oxidase expression by MPNs may further contribute to atherogenesis and thrombosis. Finally, there is evidence that increased activation of the renin‐angiotensin system by the overactivity of the JAK/STAT pathway may cause deleterious effects on the cardiovascular system.In the context of MPNs, our finding that JAKi treatment reduces the risk of thrombosis has been observed by others including Samuelson et al. who demonstrated that rates of thrombosis were significantly lower in patients treated with ruxolitinib (IRR: 0.45, 95% CI: 0.23–0.88) [10]. In terms of cardiovascular safety more generally, a 10‐year review of the safety of ruxolitinib concluded that there was no indication of ruxolitinib treatment in patients with MF or PV increased the risk of MACE [6]. Although the cardiovascular risk profile of pacritinib has been flagged previously, a recent risk‐adjusted safety analysis of the PERSIST trials, which took into account the differential time of treatment of the BAT arm compared to the pacritinib arm, concluded that there was no excess in bleeding, cardiac events or thrombosis in patients treated with pacritinib [17].It should also be noted that the cardiovascular safety of JAKis in other patient populations has been investigated. In the treatment of atopic dermatitis, JAKi treatment posed little‐to‐no effect on the risk of MACE [18]. These findings were corroborated in a large cohort of patients with immune‐mediated inflammatory skin diseases [19].In recent post hoc analyses of the original ORAL Surveillance study in RA, evidence is emerging that the increased rates of MACE secondary to JAKi treatment primarily occurred in patients who had pre‐existing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [20]. This suggests that the cardiovascular risk profile of JAKi treatment in MPNs may be different in patients with pre‐existing cardiovascular co‐morbidities. This supports an individualised approach to cardiovascular risk management in MPN patients, notably since they are already at increased risk of cardiovascular complications. Although both rheumatoid disease and MPNs exhibit a chronic inflammatory state, differences underlying the mechanism and management of these diseases may be responsible for their differing cardiovascular risk profiles. As aspirin is routinely used in the treatment of MPNs to reduce the risk of thromboembolic events in the microvasculature [21], it is plausible this may account for the difference in MACE in patients with RA and MPNs.Although this analysis found no significant increased adverse risk of hypertension and MACE with JAKi treatment, JAKi are known to impact cholesterol and cause weight gain [6, 7] and so cardiovascular health should continue to be closely monitored in this patient population.4.1Study LimitationsThere are several limitations to this work which must be acknowledged. We only had access to publicly available data so our calculation of event rates may differ from the true rate, especially since certain studies did not report categories of interest in our primary outcomes. Moreover, our thromboembolic event and MACE definitions were not adjudicated by a central committee and so may be heterogenous between trials. There was also a large variation in follow‐up duration between JAKi and control groups and between the trials themselves. As noted in our results, the majority of trials included were for ruxolitinib so these results may not be generalisable to all JAKis used in MPN treatments. This was mainly due to the inclusion of JAKi, usually ruxolitinib, in the control group of more recent JAKi trials in MPNs. Most of the included studies were clinical trials which may disproportionately exclude individuals with significant comorbidities, introducing a degree of bias which may limit the generalisability of our results to the wider population. Finally, the heterogeneity of MPNs, JAKis and controls used within the included trials may have introduced confounding factors, limiting the generalisability of our results. In particular, the heterogenous cytoreductive drugs used as control may each have separate cardiovascular risk profiles which could have influenced the risk of complications and different MPN subtypes may predispose patients to varying levels of risk of adverse cardiac complications.5ConclusionIn this meta‐analysis, JAKi treatment for the treatment of MPNs was associated with a reduced risk of thromboembolic events compared to control, primarily driven by studies of ruxolitinib in PV and MF. JAKi treatment was not associated with an increased risk of MACE or hypertension, adding to the existing body of evidence demonstrating the safety of JAKi in the treatment of MPNs. Further prospective clinical trials are warranted to confirm these findings and characterise the cardiovascular profile of other JAKis in all types of MPNs.Author ContributionsConceptualisation: Roberta Dunn, Claire Harrison, Yunfan Yang and Jennifer O'Sullivan.

As originally stated in the Framingham studies, diabetes is associated with an increased risk of HF. Subsequent studies not only corroborated these findings but also identified HF as the most frequent first onset of cardiovascular involvement. The paramount role of proper management of common modifiable risk factors such as hypertension, obesity, dyslipidemia and smoking, became rapidly clear. Conversely, the impact of intensive glycemic control was more contentious. A large meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials reported a lack of effect of strict glycemic control as compared to standard care on HF-related outcomes. The considerable heterogeneity of the effect estimate and the higher risk conferred by thiazolidinediones suggested that mechanism of action of antidiabetic drugs played a key role. Furthermore, the safety concerns of pioglitazone led Food and Drug Administration to release a guidance for drug manufacturers stating that cardiovascular risk should be comprehensively evaluated during drug development. Surprisingly, in just a few years, large cardiovascular outcome trials established the beneficial cardiovascular effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors. These effects were consistent regardless diabetes and ejection fraction. Therefore, scientific community started to question the glucose-lowering and diuretic properties of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors as the unique mechanisms for improved outcomes. A plenty of preclinical and clinical studies identified several mechanisms besides glucose-lowering effects. However, these mechanistic studies focused on animal models and patients with established HF. If the same mechanisms account for beneficial effects in patients at risk for or with pre-HF is unknown. Grubić Rotkvić et al published an interesting work adding data in early stages HF.", "body": "Core Tip: Despite the advances in pharmacological therapy of symptomatic heart failure (HF), evidence for asymptomatic patients is poor, and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors are currently not recommended in pre-HF patients without diabetes. Therefore, further studies are needed to provide efficacy and mechanistic insights in patients in early stages of HF, especially considering the significant clinical and financial implications of treating HF at the beginning of its natural history.TO THE EDITORHeart failure (HF), which falls outside the historical macrovascular or microvascular categorizations of diabetes complications, has long been overlooked in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), despite its increasing prevalence and mortality. As originally stated in the Framingham heart study, T2DM is associated with an increased risk of HF[1]. Subsequent studies not only corroborated these findings, but also identified HF as the most frequent first onset of cardiovascular involvement[2,3]. Consequently, the paramount role of proper management of common modifiable risk factors such as hypertension, obesity, dyslipidemia, and smoking has become clear. In contrast, the impact of intensive glycemic control has been more contentious.Previously, a large meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reported that strict glycemic control had a lack of effect on HF-related outcomes when compared to standard care (odds ratio: 1.20, 95% confidence interval: 0.96-1.48)[4]. The considerable heterogeneity of the effect estimate (I2 = 69%) and the higher risk for HF conferred by thiazolidinediones suggests that the mechanism of action of antidiabetic drugs plays a key role[4]. In fact, due to safety concerns regarding pioglitazone, the Food and Drug Administration has released guidelines stating that drug manufacturers should comprehensively evaluate cardiovascular risk during drug development[5].In recent years, large cardiovascular outcome trials have established the beneficial cardiovascular effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i)[6]. These effects were consistent, regardless of the diabetic status or ejection fraction[7,8]. Therefore, the scientific community has begun to consider the glucose-lowering and diuretic properties of SGLT2i as unique mechanisms for improved outcomes. Numerous preclinical and clinical studies have identified several other mechanisms affecting metabolism, bioenergetics, fibrosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress[9]. However, these mechanistic studies have focused on animal models and patients with established HF. Therefore, whether the same mechanisms account for the beneficial effects in patients “at risk of HF” or with “pre-HF” remains unknown[10].In the recent issue of the World Journal of Cardiology, Grubić Rotkvić et al[11] published an interesting study that added data regarding the early stages of HF to the literature. Between 2019 and 2022, data was collected from two university hospitals in Zagreb, including information on biomarkers of inflammation, oxidative stress, myocardial stress, and echocardiographic parameters[11]. Despite the challenges posed by the Corona Virus Infectious Disease-2019 pandemic, the authors enrolled 64 patients with T2DM who were taking metformin[11]. Owing to suboptimal glycemic control, participants were divided into two groups to receive an additional antihyperglycemic drug, with one group receiving an SGLT2i and the other receiving a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (to serve as an active-controlled group)[11]. In both groups hypertension and obesity were the most common comorbidities. Nearly all patients had increased relative wall thickness and at least grade I diastolic dysfunction[10]. The only significant baseline differences included a higher blood pressure (both systolic and diastolic) and body mass index in the SGLT2i group[11]. In a previous report, Grubić Rotkvić et al[12] observed a significant increase in hematocrit and a significant decrease in body mass index in patients who were prescribed an SGLT2i. Furthermore, imaging markers of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and diastolic and systolic functions were significantly improved by SGLT2i; however, no changes in any biomarkers were observed[12].In the present study, the authors further analyzed important clinical variables that were not significantly affected by SGLT2i or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors. Two subgroups were identified for each variable of interest according to the baseline values, and regression analyses were performed to evaluate the predictors of improved outcomes. Notably, lower myeloperoxidase (MPO) and polymerase chain reaction levels were observed in patients with higher baseline values; however, the magnitudes of these reductions were not statistically different between the treatment groups. In contrast, both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure decreased significantly more (both P < 0.001) in the subgroups with higher baseline values (> 131 mmHg and > 80.50 mmHg, respectively). The only significant difference between treatment groups was observed in the subgroup with a baseline SBP ≤ 131 mmHg, where SBP increased slightly upon treatment with empagliflozin (P < 0.001).Regarding biomarkers, no differences in N-terminal B-type natriuretic peptide levels were observed in this study, regardless of the baseline measurements (P = 0.519) or treatment groups (P = 0.088). Conversely, MPO and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels decreased to a greater extent in patients with a higher burden of inflammation (≥ 91 ng/mL and ≥ 1.91 mg/L, respectively). However, although the reduction in hsCRP levels reached statistical significance (P = 0.012), the decrease in MPO levels was not statistically significant (P = 0.052). Similar results were noted for global longitudinal strain (GLS), with significant improvements in patients with a GLS > -17.84% (P < 0.001), irrespective of the treatment method. Regression analysis was performed to evaluate the predictors of improved outcomes in this study. Notably, therapy with SGLT2i was found to be the only significant independent predictor of an increase in the stroke volume index. Finally, readers should be aware of important shortcomings of this study, such as limited sample size and follow-up.Despite the large amount of data on SGLT2i, only a few mechanistic studies have focused on patients in early stages of HF (Table 1). According to the Universal Definition of HF, endorsed by both American and European HF scientific societies, patients with diabetes, hypertension, and obesity, once recognized as “Stage A HF”, are now identified as “at risk of HF”[10]. Three studies investigated the effects of SGLT2i on biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress in patients with T2DM[13-15]. Reactive oxygen species negatively modulate several signaling pathways resulting in cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, impaired calcium homeostasis, and systemic inflammation, leading to HF progression[16]. A small prospective study conducted by Iannantuoni et al[13] evaluated 15 T2DM patients receiving empagliflozin for 24 weeks. They reported reduced levels of hsCRP and MPO in this population, which was similar to the results found by Grubić Rotkvić et al[11]. Furthermore, they reported that in this population, leukocytes expressed higher levels of interleukin-10 and glutathione and lower levels of superoxide production. Another recent retrospective study of 200 patients with T2DM reported consistent effects on CRP levels after 12 months of treatment with SGLT2i[14]. In addition, Wang et al[15] conducted an RCT assigning T2DM patients to either dapagliflozin or a placebo and found that after 1 year of follow-up, dapagliflozin significantly reduced interleukin-1 levels and limited the peripheral blood mononuclear cell maximal oxygen consumption rate, a novel marker of inflammation. On the other hand, five studies assessed the impact of SGLT2i on key echocardiographic measures enrolling patients with overt LVH or diastolic dysfunction. Both structural heart disease and diastolic dysfunction detect patients with pre-HF (prior stage B HF)[10]. An analysis of the DAPA-LVH RCT revealed that a reduction in CRP levels had a low correlation with improved GLS[17]. Conversely, in another DAPA-LVH sub-study, a reduction in the left ventricular mass index was independent of anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects and reverse remodeling was not linked to the baseline neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio[18]. Furthermore, in the ELUCIDATE study[19], the levels of transforming growth factor B did not differ significantly between the patients who received dapagliflozin and those who received standard care. Finally, in two RCTs evaluating the effect of dapagliflozin and empagliflozin on left ventricular function in patients with T2DM, the filling pressures at rest and after exercise improved early and significantly after treatment[20,21].Table 1Main studies evaluating the effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors on biomarkers and echocardiographic parameters in patients at risk for or with pre-heart failure\nRef.\n\n\nYear\n\n\nStudy design\n\n\nCohort\n\n\nMean HbA1c\n\n\nPrevalent SGLT2i\n\n\nMain outcomes\n\nIannantuoni et al[13]2019Single-center, prospective, observational15 T2DM patientsAfter 6 months, 8% to 7%Empagliflozin After 6 months, hsCRP decrease1, MPO decrease1, IL-10 increase1, GSR increase1, CAT mRNA increase1, GSH increase1Brown et al[17]2021Single-center, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled47 T2DM patients with LVHNADapagliflozin After 12 months, GLS increase1Rau et al[21]2021Single-center, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel groups, randomized42 T2DM patientsAfter 3 months, 7.5% to 7.1%Empagliflozin After 3 months, E decrease1, E/A decrease1, E/e’ decrease1Shim et al[20]2021Single-center, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled58 T2DM patients with at least grade I diastolic dysfunctionNADapagliflozin After 6 months, DR25W increase1, DR50W increase1, e’25W increase1, E/e'50W decrease1Lin et al[19]2024Single-center, prospective, open-label, randomized, active-controlled76 T2DM patientsAfter 6 months, 7.8% to 7.1%Dapagliflozin After 6 months, LVESV decrease1, LVMI decrease1, LVDd decrease1Gherbon et al[14]2024Single-center, retrospective200 T2DM patientsAfter 12 months, 8.4% to 7.3%Dapagliflozin, EmpagliflozinAfter 12 months, CRP decrease1, SBP decrease1, DBP decrease1, NT-proBNP decrease1Wang et al[15]2024Single-center, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled62 T2DM patientsNADapagliflozin After 12 months, IL-1B decrease1, PBMC decline1Dihoum et al[18]2024Single-center, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled60 T2DM patients with LVHAfter 12 months, 7.8% to 7.2%Dapagliflozin After 12 months, CRP decrease1, IL-1B decrease, LVM decrease1, GLS increase1Grubić Rotkvić et al[11,12]2024Two-center, prospective, non-randomized64 T2DM patientsAfter 6 months, 8.5% to 6.7%Dapagliflozin, EmpagliflozinAfter 6 months, decrease IVST decrease1, E/e’ decrease1, decT decrease1, SVi increase1, GLS increase, hsCRP and MPO decrease1\nP < 0.05.HbA1c: Hemoglobin A1c; SGLT2i: Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors; T2DM: Type 2 diabetes mellitus; hsCRP: High-sensitivity C-reactive protein; MPO: Myeloperoxidase; IL: Interleukin; GSR: Glutathione S-reductase; CAT: Catalase; GSH: Glutathione; LVMI: Left ventricular mass index; GLS: Global longitudinal strain; DR: Diastolic reserve; LVESV: Left ventricular end-systolic volume; LVDd: Left ventricular diastolic diameter; SBP: Systolic blood pressure; DBP: Diastolic blood pressure; NT-proBNP: N-terminal B-type natriuretic peptide; PBMC: Peripheral blood mononuclear cell; LVH: Left ventricular hypertrophy; LVM: Left ventricular mass; IVST: Interventricular septum thickness; decT: Deceleration time; SVi: Stroke volume index; NA: Not applicable.Despite advances in pharmacological therapy for symptomatic HF, evidence for asymptomatic patients is poor and strictly limited to soft outcomes such as biomarkers and echocardiographic measures.

We aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of RDN in a systematic review and meta‐analysis of sham‐controlled randomized clinical trials (RCT).MethodsDatabases were searched until September 10th, 2024, to identify RCTs evaluating RDN for treating URH versus sham control. The primary outcomes were the change in office and ambulatory 24‐h systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Secondary outcomes were changes in daytime and nighttime SBP and DBP, home BP, number of anti‐HTN drugs, and related complications. Mean differences (MD) and relative risks (RR) described the effects of RDN on BP and complications, respectively, using random effects meta‐analyses. GRADE methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence (COE).ResultsWe found 16 included sham‐controlled RCTs [RDN (n = 1594) vs. sham (n = 1225)]. RDN significantly reduced office SBP (MD −4.26 mmHg, 95% CI: −5.68 to −2.84), 24 h ambulatory SBP (MD −2.63 mmHg), office DBP (MD −2.15 mmHg), 24‐h ambulatory DBP (MD −1.27 mmHg), and daytime SBP and DBP (MD −3.29 and 2.97 mmHg), compared to the sham. The rate of severe complications was low in both groups (0%–2%). The heterogeneity was high among most indices, and CoE was very low for most outcomes.ConclusionRDN significantly reduced several SBP and DBP outcomes versus sham without significantly increasing complications.

Despite improvement in the pharmacologic treatment of HTN, a substantial percentage of patients have uncontrolled HTN (medicated by two drugs) or drug‐resistant HTN (medicated by three or more drugs, including diuretics). The main causes of these conditions are determined to be nonadherence to medications and insufficient or inappropriate selection of drugs [3]. One of the contributing factors in the development of resistant HTN is sympathetic nerve hyperactivity, especially in obese patients [4]. One of the modern methods of treating HTN is based on deactivating these nerves, a minimally invasive percutaneous procedure called renal denervation (RDN) [5]. Specific types of RDN have been approved by recent guidelines and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), mentioned as a supplementary or alternative treatment for resistant HTN [6, 7]. However, absolute indications of RDN for treating HTN have not been proposed [8].Based on the 2023 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines, RDN can be considered as an option in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) > 40 mL/min/1.73 m2 who have uncontrolled blood pressure (BP) despite the use of antihypertensive drug (anti‐HTN) combination therapy [9]. RDN is becoming an alternative treatment for patients whose BP cannot be controlled with anti‐HTN medications (resistant HTN). Moreover, previous studies have shown that those with poor medication compliance would benefit from this procedure, considering the decreased or resolved need to take routine drugs after this procedure [10, 11].Although previous meta‐analyses that investigated the effectiveness and the safety of RDN for the treatment of resistant and uncontrolled and a subgroup analysis of only sham‐controlled trials consistently showed that RDN reduced office and 24‐h SBP [3, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], there are still unanswered questions. The range of changes differs based on the systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressures (DBP), up to 60 mmHg in SBPs and 40 mmHg in DBPs. One of these dilemmas is the superiority of various types of RDN. Three main types of RDN (radiofrequency (RF), ultrasound (US), and alcohol‐mediated denervation) have been evaluated in several RCTs during recent years. Still, the optimal method in various subgroups of patients has yet to be determined [15]. Another reason for conducting this analysis is that, although previous meta‐analyses have been performed, methodological differences between the systematic reviews and the trials included make it challenging to draw generalizable conclusions. In addition, three significant recent trials—TARGET BPI [16], SMART [17], and the Iberis‐HTN Trial by Jiang and colleagues [18]—were not included in two of the most recent meta‐analyses in this field [14, 19]. Hence, we performed a comprehensive meta‐analysis of randomized, sham‐controlled clinical trials investigating the beneficial and harmful effects of RDN on BP across different devices.2Methods2.1Protocol and RegistrationThis systematic review and meta‐analysis adhered to the PRISMA guidelines [20]. The review protocol, with the registration number CRD42024546447, was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO).2.2Eligibility CriteriaStudies were considered for inclusion if they satisfied the following criteria: (1) RCTs evaluating any RDN versus a sham procedure in adults aged 18 years or older with resistant HTN; (2) studies providing data SBP and DBP; and (3) studies published in the English language. The exclusion criteria encompassed nonrandomized studies, observational studies, case reports, review articles, editorials, and studies that did not include a sham procedure as a control.2.3Study SearchesA thorough literature search was performed using PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) from their inception to July 1st, 2024. The search strategy incorporated terms related to RDN, treatment‐resistant HTN (TRH), resistant and uncontrolled HTN, and randomized controlled trials. The detailed search strategies are available in Supporting Information S2: Table 1. Additionally, reference lists of included articles and relevant reviews were manually screened to identify further studies.2.4Study Selection and Data ManagementDuplicate records were identified and removed using the Rayyan web application, facilitating an efficient and accurate screening process. Rayyan was also used to screen titles and abstracts, allowing independent reviewers (S.H. and E.S.) to classify studies as included, excluded, or marked for further consideration [21]. Full‐text articles of potentially relevant studies were assessed for inclusion. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus or consultation with a third reviewer (R.N.).2.5Data ExtractionData extraction was performed using a standardized, predetermined form in Excel. Extracted data included study characteristics (author, year of publication, sample size, follow‐up duration), patient demographics (age, gender, baseline BP, body mass index [BMI]), intervention details (type of RDN, comparator), and outcomes per arm (RDN or sham).2.6Outcomes and DefinitionsPrimary outcomes were office and 24‐h ambulatory SBP and DBP. Secondary outcomes include daytime, nighttime, and home SBP and DBP. Moreover, adverse events such as hypertensive and hypotensive emergencies, acute kidney injury (AKI) (sudden rise in creatinine > 50%), hospitalization for heart failure (HHF), hospitalization for atrial fibrillation (HAF), all‐cause mortality (ACM), adverse event rate, severe adverse event rate, severe cerebrovascular adverse event rate, new end‐stage renal disease (ESRD), embolic events accompanied by end‐organ damage, hospitalization for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) (cerebrovascular accidents (CVA), myocardial infarction (MI)), new renal artery stenosis > 70%, major vascular complication (renal artery perforation or dissection). Moreover, the changes in the number of anti‐HTN drugs and anti‐HTN drug index were measured. Definitions of resistant HTN and clinical outcomes followed standard criteria described in the included studies.\n–\nResistant Hypertension: It is defined as above‐goal elevated BP in patients despite the concurrent use of ≥ 3 anti‐HTN medications from various classes, commonly including a long‐acting calcium channel blocker (CCB), a blocker of the renin–angiotensin system (angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker), and a diuretic [22].–\nUncontrolled Hypertension: A BP above 140/90, which might be caused secondary to poor adherence or an inadequate treatment regimen, as well as those with true treatment resistance [22].–\nDrug Index: It is constructed as Class N (number of classes of antihypertensive drugs) × (sum of doses) [23].\n2.7Risk of Bias AssessmentTwo independent authors (H.T. and M.T.) evaluated the risk of bias in individual RCTs using the Cochrane Collaboration tool for assessing the risk of bias in randomized trials (RoB 2) [24]. Discrepancies between the reviewers were resolved by consensus. RoB 2 assessments addressed five domains, including the randomization process, deviations from intended interventions, missing outcome data, measurement of outcomes, and selection of the reported results. Each domain and each RCT was then categorized as having a low, high, or unclear risk of bias [24].2.8Statistical AnalysesStatistical analyses were conducted with the R software [25] (R for Windows, version 4.1.3, Vienna, Austria) and R Studio version 1.1.463 (Posit PBC, Boston, MA, USA), utilizing the tidyverse [26] and meta [27] packages.Pooled RDN effects versus medical treatment on BP outcomes were expressed as mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI); binary outcomes were expressed as relative risks (RR) with 95% CI. The between‐study variance was described with the τ\n2 estimate. Random‐effect models were used to account for variability across studies. When studies reported medians and interquartile ranges (IQR), the method developed by Lou and colleagues [28] and Wan and colleagues [29] was used to calculate the mean and SD. If the SD of the mean change was not reported, it was calculated using the formula [30]:\nSDchange=SDbaseline2+SDfinal2−(2×0.6×SDbaseline×SDfinal).\nMeta‐analyses were performed using a random‐effects model with restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimation. Heterogeneity among studies was assessed using Cochrane's Q statistic and I\n2 statistic [31], with I\n2 values classified as low (< 25%), moderate (25%–50%), or high (> 50%) heterogeneity. Visual and statistical assessments for publication bias were conducted using funnel plots and Begg's and Egger's tests [32].Subgroup analyses by device type (alcohol, RF, and US) and medication status (on vs. off) were conducted. A p for interaction < 0.10 meant a significant subgroup effect for an outcome. Sensitivity analyses were performed using three methods: (1) by using a fixed‐effect model, (2) by using a leave‐one‐out sensitivity analysis, and (3) by excluding the studies that had < 100 participants in each arm. Meta‐regression analysis was conducted for the outcomes of 24‐h SBP and DBP with variables of age, BMI, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), male proportion, baseline mean SBP, and follow‐up duration. Certainty of evidence and strength of recommendations were performed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) Guidelines. A summary of COE was performed based on the evaluation of the pooled studies' number for each index and their design, indirectness, imprecision, and the number of included patients.3Results3.1Study SelectionA comprehensive literature search identified a total of 5839 records from various databases, including PubMed (n = 3356), Scopus (n = 1526), Embase (n = 708), and Cochrane CENTRAL (n = 249). After excluding 932 duplicates, 4907 unique records were screened based on titles and abstracts. During this initial screening, 4860 records were excluded for not meeting the inclusion criteria. Consequently, 47 full‐text articles were retrieved for a detailed evaluation. After further assessment, 25 articles were excluded due to not aligning with the required methods, population, or intervention/comparison criteria. Ultimately, 21 reports from 16 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in the systematic review and meta‐analysis (Figure 1) [16, 17, 18, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50].Figure 1PRISMA flow diagram of included studies.The selected studies comprised a total of 2819 participants (RDN: 1594 and sham procedure: 1225), with sample sizes ranging from 51 to 515 participants per study. Follow‐up periods were varied, with the majority ranging from 2 to 12 months, although some extended up to 36 months. Participants' demographics showed a broad range of ages, with the mean age of participants spanning from 44.5 to 65.5 years. The mean BMI across studies ranged from 28.2 to 34.2 kg/m2. The proportion of male participants also varied; some studies had as few as 18% male participants, while others had up to 95.5%. The included studies also reported diverse distributions of diabetes mellitus (DMII) prevalence and the number of anti‐HTN medications taken by participants (Table 1).Table 1Primary characteristics of included trials.Trials, author/acronym, year (reference)NCTCountryDeviceEnergy sourceScape criteriaFU (M)NumberRDSham1.

Overall, five studies' evaluations revealed a high risk of bias, while two others were categorized as having some concerns about bias. Nine others showed a low risk of bias (Supporting Information S1: Figure 1).3.3Effects of RDN on Primary Outcomes3.3.124‐h Ambulatory Blood PressuresRDN significantly reduced 24‐h SBP (MD −2.30 mmHg, 95% CI: −3.53 to −1.07) (Figure 2A) and DBP (MD −1.21 mmHg, 95% CI: −2.18 to −0.23) compared to medical treatment (Figure 2B). Of the 11 trials pooled in the 24‐h SBP calculation, RADIANCE II (2023) had the most prominent difference between the two groups (MD −6.00 mmHg, 95% CI: −8.72 to −3.28), while four other studies revealed a statistically considerable difference between two categories, but the MD was lower. Ten studies were analyzed in the pooled data of 24‐h DBP; seven trials showed a more prominent decrease in the MD, and three showed an insignificantly higher reduction in this index in the control group. The heterogeneity among studies included in the pooled analyses of these two indices was high, showing I\n2 of 90% for 24‐h SBP and I\n2 of 93% for 24‐h DBP.Figure 2Effect of RDN versus medical treatment on (A) 24‐h systolic blood pressure, (B) 24‐h diastolic blood pressure, (C) office systolic blood pressure, and (D) office diastolic blood pressure.3.3.2Office Blood PressuresA similar pattern could be seen in the results of the office BP measurements, where RSD significantly reduced office SBP (MD −4.11 mmHg, 95% CI: −5.64 to −2.57) (Figure 2C) and office DBP (MD −1.85 mmHg, 95% CI: −3.15 to −0.55) (Figure 2D) in comparison with medical treatment. However, like 24‐h BPs, the included studies in both pooled analyses showed a high heterogeneity. Among nine studies included in the pooled analysis of office SBP, SPYRAL HTN‐OFF MED Pivotal (2020) demonstrated the most substantial reduction in the SBP (MD −6.70 mmHg, 95% CI: −7.42 to −5.98), while RADIANCE‐HTN TRIO (2022) was the only study which revealed the increased mean of SBP in the RDN group compared to the control group. However, the difference was not significant. Eight studies were included in the pooled analysis of office DBP; six showed a more substantial decrease in DBP, but only three showed significant differences. The measured I\n2 for office SBP and DBP were 91% and 96%, respectively.3.3.3Effects of RDN on Secondary OutcomesAmong the secondary outcomes, the MD between the RDN and control group was insignificant in the pooled analysis of the night‐time BPs (Supporting Information S1: Figure 2), home BPs (Supporting Information S1: Figure 3), and daytime DBP RDN (Supporting Information S1: Figure 4B). However, this intervention significantly reduced daytime SBP versus medical treatment (MD −3.29 mmHg, 95% CI: −5.43 to −1.15) (Supporting Information S1: Figure 4A). The heterogeneity between studies was significant among the nine included trials in this study (I\n2 = 80%) (Supporting Information S2: Table 2).Although there was no significant difference in the reduction of the number of anti‐HTN medications between RDN and medical treatment (MD −0.08, 95% CI: −0.25 to 0.10) (Supporting Information S1: Figure 5), the drug index pooled analysis showed a significantly lower MD in the RDN group (MD = −0.23, 95% CI: −0.33 to −0.12) (Figure 3 and Supporting Information S2: Tables 3). Six studies included in this index revealed insignificant heterogeneity (I\n2 = 38%).Figure 3Effect of renal denervation versus medical treatment on (A) the drug index.The pooled analysis of the adverse outcomes, including embolic event which caused end‐organ damage, major access site complications, procedure‐related pain > 2 days, severe cerebrovascular adverse event rate, AKI, ACM, major vascular complications, HTN emergency, hypotension emergency, CVA, MI, creatinine rise, renal artery stenosis, percutaneous coronary intervention, HHF and HAF showed an insignificant rate (Supporting Information S2: Table 4) and also a negligible difference between risk ratios (RR) of RDN and medication group. The incidence of HTN and hypotension emergencies also showed insignificant rates and insignificant differences (Supporting Information S1: Figure 6).3.4Sensitivity and Subgroup Analyses3.4.1The 24‐h Ambulatory Mean of Systolic and Diastolic Blood PressuresFixed‐effect and random‐effect (leave‐one‐out) methods were employed for sensitivity analyses. The results from the pooled data for the random‐effect (leave‐one‐out) approach demonstrated a significant difference between groups in 24‐h SBP, with considerable heterogeneity (MD: −2.42 mmHg, 95% CI: −2.74 to −2.11, p < 0.01) (Supporting Information S1: Figure 7). Using a random‐effects model, the MD in larger studies (sample size > 100) was even larger (MD of −3.41 mmHg, 95% CI: −5.10 to −1.72) (Supporting Information S1: Figure 8). The subgroup analysis of the 24‐h SBP outcomes based on device type and medication status revealed significant differences between the intervention and control groups except for the US‐based device group (Supporting Information S1: Figures 9 and 10).The fixed effect model showed a significant reduction of 24 h DBP (MD; 1.63 mmHg (95% CI: −1.84 to −1.41)) (Supporting Information S1: Figure 11A), and the sensitivity analyses using the leave‐one‐out method resulted in a pooled MD of −1.27 mmHg (95% CI: −2.31 to −0.22, p = 0.02) (Supporting Information S1: Figure 11B). In larger studies, the random‐effects model yielded a MD of −2.36 mmHg (95% CI: −3.75 to −0.97) (Supporting Information S1: Figure 12). The subgroup analysis of the 24‐h SDP outcomes based on the device type and medication status revealed significant differences between intervention and control groups except for US and alcohol‐based devices groups (Supporting Information S1: Figures 13 and 14).3.4.2Office Systolic and Diastolic Blood PressureThe fixed effect model showed a significant reduction of office SBP (MD: −4.45 mmHg (95% CI: −4.85 to −4.05)) (Supporting Information S1: Figure 15A), and the sensitivity analyses using the leave‐one‐out method resulted in a pooled MD of −4.26 mmHg (95% CI: −5.68 to −2.84, p < 0.01) (Supporting Information S1: Figure 15B). In larger studies, the random‐effects model yielded a MD of −5.44 mmHg (95% CI: −6.93 to −3.95) (Supporting Information S1: Figure 16). The subgroup analysis by the type of device showed significant differences between the intervention and control groups in RF and US‐based devices (Supporting Information S1: Figure 17).The fixed effect model showed a reduction in office DBP by 2.38 mmHg (95% CI: −2.68 to −2.07), with substantial heterogeneity (I\n2 = 96%) (Supporting Information S1: Figure 18A). Sensitivity analyses using the leave‐one‐out method resulted in a pooled MD of −2.15 mmHg (95% CI: −3.40 to −0.90, p < 0.01) with substantial heterogeneity (I\n2 = 96%) (Supporting Information S1: Figure 18B). Additionally, a random‐effects model including large studies and a separate supplementary analysis with a reduced data set confirmed a similar significant reduction in office DBP, with a pooled MD of −2.95 mmHg (95% CI: −4.28 to −1.63) and moderate heterogeneity (I\n2 = 66%) (Supporting Information S1: Figure 19). The subgroup analysis by the type of device showed significant differences between the intervention and control groups in RF‐based methods and insignificant differences between groups in US‐based devices (Supporting Information S1: Figure 20).3.4.3Home Systolic and Diastolic Blood PressureThe fixed effect model also showed a reduction of home SBP by 1.78 mmHg (95% CI: −2.38 to −1.19), with low heterogeneity (I\n2 = 0%) (Supporting Information S1: Figure 21A). Sensitivity analyses using the leave‐one‐out method resulted in a pooled MD of −1.78 mmHg (95% CI: −2.38 to −1.19, p < 0.01) with no heterogeneity (I\n2 = 0%) (Supporting Information S1: Figure 21B). The fixed effect model also showed an increase of home DBP by 0.07 mmHg (95% CI: −0.29 to 0.42), with low heterogeneity (I\n2 = 0%) (Supporting Information S1: Figure 22A). Sensitivity analyses using the leave‐one‐out method resulted in a pooled MD of 0.07 mmHg (95% CI: −0.29 to 0.42, p = 0.07) with no heterogeneity (I\n2 = 0%) (Supporting Information S1: Figure 22B).3.4.4Nighttime Systolic and Diastolic Blood PressureThe fixed effect model showed a reduction in nighttime SBP by 2.01 mmHg (95% CI: −2.51 to −1.51), with substantial heterogeneity (I\n2 = 90%) (Supporting Information S1: Figure 23A). Sensitivity analyses using the leave‐one‐out method resulted in a pooled MD of −2.14 mmHg (95% CI: −4.58 to 0.30, p = 0.19) with substantial heterogeneity (I\n2 = 90%) (Supporting Information S1: Figure 23B). The subgroup analysis by the type of device showed insignificant differences between the intervention and control groups in both RF‐ and US‐based devices (Supporting Information S1: Figure 24). The fixed effect model showed an increase in nighttime DBP by 0.28 mmHg (95% CI: −0.12 to 0.68), with substantial heterogeneity (I\n2 = 86%) (Supporting Information S1: Figure 25A). Sensitivity analyses using the leave‐one‐out method resulted in a pooled MD of −0.81 mmHg (95% CI: −2.85 to 1.22, p = 0.43) with substantial heterogeneity (I\n2 = 86%) (Supporting Information S1: Figure 25B). Interestingly, the subgroup analysis by the type of device showed a significantly lower MD of DBP in the intervention group in RF‐based methods, while the differences between the intervention and control groups in the US‐based devices were insignificant (Supporting Information S1: Figure 26).3.4.5Daytime Systolic and Diastolic Blood PressureThe fixed effect model reduced daytime SBP by 1.70 mmHg (95% CI: −2.13 to −1.26) (Supporting Information S1: Figure 27A). Sensitivity analyses using the leave‐one‐out method resulted in a pooled MD of −3.29 mmHg (95% CI: −5.43 to −1.15, p < 0.01) with substantial heterogeneity (I\n2 = 80%) (Supporting Information S1: Figure 27B). The subgroup analysis by the type of device showed significant differences between the intervention and control groups in the RF‐ and the insignificant differences between the two groups in US‐based devices (Supporting Information S1: Figure 28). The fixed effect model showed a reduction in daytime DBP by 7.92 mmHg (95% CI: −8.24 to −7.59), with substantial heterogeneity (I\n2 = 97%) (Supporting Information S1: Figure 29A). Sensitivity analyses using the leave‐one‐out method resulted in a pooled MD of −2.97 mmHg (95% CI: −5.64 to −0.30, p = 0.1) with substantial heterogeneity (I\n2 = 97%) (Supporting Information S1: Figure 29B). The subgroup analysis by the type of device showed significant differences between the intervention and control groups in the RF‐based and insignificant differences between the intervention and control groups in the US‐based devices (Supporting Information S1: Figure 30).3.4.6Antihypertensive Medications Number and Drug IndexThe fixed effect model showed a reduction of the number of anti‐HTN medications by −0.06 (95% CI: −0.16 to 0.03) with substantial heterogeneity (I\n2 = 70%) (Supporting Information S1: Figure 31A). Sensitivity analyses further support these results, with a random effects model showing a MD of −0.08 (95% CI: −0.25 to 0.10, P:0.38) and similar heterogeneity (I\n2 = 73%) (Supporting Information S1: Figure 31B). Additionally, a random‐effects model, including large studies, showed a MD of −0.03 (95% CI: −0.38 to 0.32), with substantial heterogeneity (I\n2 = 89%, p < 0.01) (Supporting Information S1: Figure 32).The fixed effect model showed a significant reduction in the drug index in the RDN group compared to the control group by an MD of −0.23 (95% CI: −0.33 to −0.12) with insignificant heterogeneity (I\n2 = 38%) (Supporting Information S1: Figure 33A). The random effects model, using the leave‐one‐out method, showed a statistically significant difference between the intervention and control group with an MD of −0.23 (95% CI: −0.33 to −0.12, p < 0.01) and similar heterogeneity (I\n2 = 38%) (Supporting Information S1: Figure 33B). The comparison between random effect and fixed‐effect analysis revealed differences in some indices. This comparison highlights the variability and consistency in effect size estimates between the two meta‐analytical approaches, indicating that the nighttime results are statistically significant. All effects are MD between RDN and sham in mmHg (Supporting Information S2: Table 5).Overall, only RF‐based devices demonstrated significant differences in 24‐h DBP, office DBP, and day SBP subgroup analysis (Supporting Information S1: Figures 13, 20, and 28). The subgroup analysis based on the on‐ and off‐med subgroups in 24‐h SBP and DBP showed that although the difference between both subgroups was significant, pooled MD of off‐med subgroup were more prominent than on‐med patients in both mentioned indices (Supporting Information S1: Figures 9 and 14).3.4.7Meta‐Regression and Publication BiasThe 24‐h SBP and DBP meta‐regression analyses showed nonsignificant trends for age, BMI, and the proportion of male patients, with wide CI (Supporting Information S1: Figure 34A–F). Significant associations were found for GFR, baseline mean SBP, and follow‐up time, with narrower CI and consistent data patterns (Supporting Information S1: Figure 34G–L).The sham‐controlled design of some trials may have introduced bias, as it is unclear whether participants in the sham group were effectively blinded, potentially influencing the outcomes. However, a p value of 0.18 (Supporting Information S1: Figure 35) indicates no statistically significant evidence of asymmetry in evaluating the number of anti‐HTN medications. Therefore, publication bias is unlikely. Moreover, a time‐trend analysis of three trials with 2–12‐month follow‐ups showed that the MD of 24‐h AMBP had an overall increasing trend in systolic and diastolic indexes (Supporting Information S1: Figure 36).3.5Certainty of Evidence (COE)Table 2 presents the GRADE summary of the findings table with COE assessments. Moreover, two independent assessors (P.E. and A.E). were invited to assess the certainty of evidence. Disagreements were referred to a third senior author (K.H.), who asked three researchers and a professional coauthor to the GRADE PRO platform to revise the process. We chose the seven most important indicators of the certainty of evidence. However, considering Cochrane's standards, 24‐h office SBP and DBO and changes in the number of anti‐HTN were categorized as very low certainty, and the drug index was classified as low certainty of evidence. The main causes of downgrading of COE were as follows: (1) studies that carried large weight for the overall effect estimate rated high risk of bias due to missed outcomes. (2) The rate of heterogeneity is very high. (3) Many studies have shown bias due to a high rate of missed outcomes and/or lack of appropriate concealment. (4) A lower number of studies report the index.Table 2Certainty of evidence based on GRADE criteria has been determined for indices.Certainty assessmentNo. of patientsEffectCertaintyImportanceNo. of studiesStudy designRisk of biasInconsistencyIndirectnessImprecisionOther considerationsRDNSHAM‐controlledAbsolute (95% CI)24‐h systolic blood pressure13Randomized trialsSeriousa\nVery seriousb\nNot seriousNot seriousNone15131162MD 2.63 mmHg lower (4.66 lower to 1 lower)\n⊕◯◯◯\nVery lowa, b\n\nCritical24‐h diastolic blood pressure12Randomized trialsSeriousVery seriousb\nNot seriousNot seriousNone13681016MD 1.27 mmHg lower (2.31 lower to 0.22 lower)\n⊕◯◯◯\nVery lowb, c\n\nCriticalOffice systolic blood pressure11Randomized trialsSeriousa\nVery seriousb\nNot seriousNot seriousNone14421097MD 4.26 mmHg lower (5.68 lower to 2.54 lower)\n⊕◯◯◯\nVery lowa, b\n\nCriticalOffice diastolic blood pressure10Randomized trialsSeriousc\nVery seriousb\nNot seriousNot seriousNone1297951MD 2.15 mmHg lower (3.4 lower to 0.9 lower)\n⊕◯◯◯\nVery lowb, c\n\nCriticalDaytime systolic blood pressure9Randomized trialsSeriousVery seriousb\nNot seriousNot seriousNone891732MD 3.29 mmHg lower (5.43 lower to 1.15 lower)\n⊕◯◯◯\nVery lowb, d\n\nCriticalDaytime diastolic blood pressure7Randomized trialsSeriousd\nVery seriousb\nNot seriousNot seriousNone433345MD 2.97 mmHg lower (5.54 lower to 0.3 lower)\n⊕◯◯◯\nVery low b, d\n\nCriticalNight systolic blood pressure9Randomized trialsSeriousd\nVery seriousb\nNot seriousNot seriousNone891732MD 2.14 mmHg lower (4.58 lower to 30 higher)\n⊕◯◯◯\nVery lowb, d\n\nImportantNight diastolic blood pressure7Randomized trialsSeriousc, d\nSeriousb\nNot seriousNot seriousNone433345MD 0.81 mmHg lower (2.85 lower to 0.22 higher)\n⊕⊕◯◯\nLowb, c, d\n\nImportantHome diastolic blood pressure4Randomized trialsNot seriousNot seriousNot seriousNot seriousNone540452MD 0.17 mmHg lower (2.14 lower to 1.8 higher)\n⊕⊕⊕⊕\nHigh\nImportantHome systolic blood pressure3Randomized trialsNot seriousNot seriousNot seriousnot seriousNone639476MD 1.05 mmHg lower (3.34 lower to 1.24 higher)\n⊕⊕⊕⊕\nHigh\nImportantDrug index6Randomized trialsSeriousd\nNot seriousNot seriousSeriouse\nNone573496MD 0.23 mmHg lower (0.33 lower to 0.12 lower)\n⊕⊕◯◯\nLowd, e\n\nCriticalNumber of antihypertensive drugs10Randomized trialsSeriousa\nSeriousb\nNot seriousSeriouse\nNone1297935MD 0.08 mmHg lower (0.25 lower to 0.1 lower)\n⊕◯◯◯\nVery lowa, b, e\n\nCriticalAbbreviations: CI, confidence interval; MD, mean difference.\na\nStudies that carried large weight for the overall effect estimate rated a high risk of bias due to missed outcomes.\nb\nThe rate of heterogeneity is very high (I\n2 > 75).\nc\nMany studies have shown bias due to a high rate of missed outcomes and/or lack of appropriate concealment.\nd\nIt is reported by a lower number of studies.\ne\nThe calculation of this index is based on subjective measures and patients' reports.John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.4DiscussionThis meta‐analysis represents the largest review of randomized, sham‐controlled trials evaluating RDN for TRH, encompassing 21 articles from 16 trials with 2819 patients. Our findings provide updated insights into the effectiveness of RDN in managing HTN. The analysis reveals that RDN significantly reduces office and 24‐h BP, including systolic and diastolic measures. However, the effect on home and nocturnal BP measurements was inconsistent. RDN significantly lowered 24‐h systolic BP and diastolic BP compared to medical treatment. These results indicate a substantial effect on BP reduction, although the heterogeneity among studies was high. Significant reductions were observed in office BP measurements, though again with high heterogeneity. For secondary outcomes, RDN showed a significant decrease in daytime systolic BP but no significant effect on nighttime BP or home BP measurements. The reduction in the number of anti‐HTN medications was not statistically significant, though the drug index analysis revealed a significant decrease. The adverse events associated with RDN were not significantly different from those in the control group, suggesting that RDN is a safe procedure. However, the high heterogeneity among studies and variability in BP measurement methods indicate the need for further research to refine the use of RDN in clinical practice.The effectiveness of anti‐HTN treatments in reducing major cardiovascular events is often linked to their impact on ABPM. For example, Dolan and colleagues (2007) reported that reductions in ABPM SBP and nighttime DBP are associated with decreased cardiovascular mortality [51]. Similarly, Mancia and colleagues found that increased erratic variability in DBP was significantly associated with higher cardiovascular death risk [52]. Another trial demonstrated that a ≥ 5 mmHg decline in ABPM was linked to a significant reduction in MACE [53]. Our meta‐analysis supports these findings, showing significant decreases in ABPM with RDN. This aligns with Ogoyama and colleagues's recent meta‐analysis, which found RDN effective in reducing 24‐h SBP [10]. However, our results diverge from studies regarding the effect on daytime BP. While Ogoyama and colleagues [10] reported significant short‐term effects of RDN on daytime SBP, other studies did not find substantial differences [11, 49]. Our subgroup analysis indicates that radiofrequency‐based RDN showed significant differences in daytime BP, while US‐based treatments did not, highlighting the need to consider device type when evaluating RDN efficacy.Beyond office BP measurements, nocturnal and home BP reductions in TRH (≥ 3 anti‐HTN medications, including at least one diuretic) are associated with fewer cardiovascular events and deaths [54, 55, 56, 57, 58]. For example, Kario and colleagues (2021) found that a nocturnal BP ≥ 120/70 mmHg is linked to a higher risk of heart failure [43]. ESH 2023 guidelines recommend monitoring BP variability, including home BP measurements, to assess treatment efficacy [9]. Our study found RDN significantly affects daytime SBP but not nighttime BP or home BP measurements. In addition, there is conflicting data regarding RDN's effect on daytime BP. Ogoyama and colleagues (2024) reported positive short‐term effects of RDN on daytime SBP [10], while another review, including nine RCTs, did not find significant differences between RDN and control groups [30]. Our study aligns with Ogoyama and colleagues's findings, showing a significant difference in daytime SBP but not DBP. Subgroup analysis indicated that radiofrequency‐based RDN was more effective in reducing daytime SBP than US‐based treatments, highlighting the impact of device type on treatment efficacy.Our analysis indicates that RDN is effective regardless of concurrent anti‐HTN medication use, consistent with literature suggesting that RDN's benefits are not diminished by medication use [37, 59]. Therefore, it can be understood that taking anti‐HTN medications as a boosting strategy to enhance the decline of BP in patients who have undergone RDN has no negative impact on the therapeutic effect of this intervention [10]. Nonadherence to anti‐HTN medications, common in patients with resistant HTN, can worsen BP fluctuations and cardiovascular outcomes [60]. RDN offers a stable BP reduction, potentially providing a clinical advantage over medication alone by mitigating adherence issues. The dependency on anti‐HTN medications affects their concentration in the blood; the lower level might. Previous studies have suggested that RDN may reduce the average number of anti‐HTN medications and improve quality of life [17, 49, 59, 61]. However, our analysis did not find significant differences in medication numbers between RDN and control groups. More controlled studies are needed to clarify the impact of RDN on medication use. RDN's advantage in providing a stable BP reduction may improve quality of life by reducing medication side effects and concerns about adherence. RDN's long‐term impact on office BP and reduction in MACE incidence is promising [53, 62]. While many RCTs have evaluated MACE composites, direct assessments of RDN's impact on MACE incidence are limited. The Simplicity Registry reported a 35% reduction in MACE incidence with RDN [41]. Our study supports the effectiveness of RDN in reducing office BPs and suggests its potential for improving quality of life and reducing MACE.4.1Limitations and StrengthsSeveral limitations should be considered when interpreting the findings of this meta‐analysis. First, the high heterogeneity observed across studies, particularly in 24‐h and office BP measurements, limits the generalization of results. The variation in study design, RDN devices, and patient populations may contribute to this heterogeneity. Second, not all studies consistently reported on secondary BP outcomes such as home, daytime, and nocturnal BP, leading to incomplete data for these parameters. Third, the trials included in this analysis had relatively short follow‐up periods, limiting insights into the long‐term efficacy and safety of RDN.Additionally, the impact of anti‐HTN medications was not fully addressed, as variations in medication adherence among participants could have confounded the results. The strength of our meta‐analysis lies in its emphasis on sham‐controlled trials, which bolsters the reliability of our conclusions. By incorporating recent studies and applying the GRADE approach to evaluate the quality of evidence, we provide a strong foundation for informed clinical decision‐making.4.2Conclusion and RecommendationsIn conclusion, RDN is a promising treatment for reducing BP in patients with TRH. It shows significant benefits in office and ambulatory BP measurements. The procedure appears safe and effective, with no substantial increase in adverse events. Further studies should prioritize conducting randomized controlled trials with diverse populations to enhance the generalizability of findings across various demographics. Additionally, research should focus on evaluating variations in study designs, particularly those with narrower CI favoring the intervention, to understand factors influencing outcomes. Finally, performing cost‐effectiveness analyses will provide critical insights to guide clinical decision‐making and resource allocation better. Therefore, future studies should focus on standardizing the measurement of BP outcomes, extending follow‐up durations, and rigorously addressing medication adherence to better define the role of RDN in clinical practice.Author ContributionsHamidreza Soleimani, Babak Sattartabar, Bahar Parastooei, Reza Eshraghi, Ehsan Safaee, Roozbeh Nazari, Soroush Najdaghi, Pouya Ebrahimi, Kaveh Hosseini, and Sara Hobaby contributed to conceptualization, data curation, formal analysis, investigation, methodology, project administration, resources, software, supervision, validation, visualization, writing the original draft, review, and editing.

{"PMCID": "12087299", "title": "Efficacy and safety of non‐vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants versus warfarin in atrial fibrillation and kidney failure under hemodialysis: A meta‐analysis of controlled randomized trials", "abstract": "AbstractBackgroundAtrial fibrillation (AF)‐related strokes are associated with disability and mortality. Stroke prevention with non‐vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) is the cornerstone of holistic management of AF. However, the safety and efficacy of NOACs in patients with AF on hemodialysis remain uncertain. This meta‐analysis aimed to evaluate currently available data to determine the potential utility of NOACs in AF patients with kidney failure receiving hemodialysis.MethodsWe searched the literature for randomized clinical trials comparing NOACs to VKA therapy in this population.ResultsAbout the Principal Efficacy Outcome, NOACs Did Not Decrease the Risk Compared to Warfarin (Relative Risk [RR] 0.79, 95% CI 0.45–1.37) while a Significant Heterogeneity Was Noted (p = 0.03). In the Valkyrie Study, Rivaroxaban Had better Cardiovascular Outcome than Warfarin (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.43–0.75). For the Principal Safety Outcome, the Risk Was Similar between NOACs and Warfarin (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.52–1.27) without Significant Heterogeneity (p = 0.11). The Pooled Event Rate of 3 Trials Disclosed a High Risk of all‐Cause Mortality (39.9% for NOACs, 34.6% for Warfarin) and Cardiovascular Mortality (10.1% for NOACs, 8.5% for Warfarin) for AF Patients with Kidney Failure Receiving Hemodialysis Even on Oral Anticoagulants.ConclusionOur results suggest that NOACs (rivaroxaban or apixaban) are as safe and effective as VKAs in patients with AF and kidney failure with hemodialysis. Even on oral anticoagulants, these patients remain at high risk of cardiovascular events and all‐cause mortality. Integrated care and holistic management are important for this high‐risk population.", "body": "1INTRODUCTIONAtrial fibrillation (AF), the most prevalent arrhythmia encountered in clinical practice, is associated with an increased risk of blood stasis and thrombus formation, leading to a heightened risk of stroke and thromboembolism.\n1\n The prevalence of AF is projected to reach 4% by 2050, with a lifetime risk of approximately 1 in 7 for individuals aged ≥20 years.\n2\n AF is known to elevate the risk of ischemic stroke, dementia, heart failure, myocardial infarction, and overall mortality.\n2\n\nThe AFNET study has identified that the primary causes of mortality in AF patients are peripheral artery disease, heart failure, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and renal failure.\n3\n Notably, AF‐related strokes carry a significantly higher risk of disability and mortality compared to non‐AF‐related strokes.\n4\n As such, preventing stroke is essential to the comprehensive management of AF.\n5\n\nStroke prevention in AF can be achieved through the use of oral anticoagulants, including vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) such as warfarin.\n5\n, \n6\n Four major randomized trials comparing warfarin to non‐vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have shown that NOACs are at least as effective as warfarin in preventing stroke and carry a markedly lower risk of intracranial hemorrhage.\n7\n However, these studies excluded patients with kidney failure on hemodialysis, a population in which up to 25% have concomitant AF.\n8\n, \n9\n Advanced kidney failure is characterized by enhanced platelet aggregation and endothelial dysfunction, which create a prothrombotic environment. As a result, patients with AF on hemodialysis have a threefold increased incidence of ischemic stroke.\n10\n\nWith the aging population and increasing rates of AF and cardiovascular comorbidities, the number of individuals with end‐stage renal disease is rising rapidly.\n11\n, \n12\n However, the safety and efficacy of NOACs in patients with AF on hemodialysis remain uncertain.\n13\n, \n14\n Due to the lack of robust prospective data on NOACs, if the decision to initiate anticoagulation has been made for patients with AF and kidney failure undergoing hemodialysis, warfarin has typically been the anticoagulant of choice in clinical practice. Nonetheless, interest in alternative anticoagulants has grown due to the high bleeding risk associated with VKAs in this population.\n14\n, \n15\n, \n16\n, \n17\n, \n18\n\nRecent randomized controlled trials assessing the use of NOACs for stroke prevention in AF patients with kidney failure on hemodialysis have been published. However, these studies were limited by small sample sizes, which resulted in insufficient statistical power and hindered the ability to draw definitive conclusions. This meta‐analysis aims to review the currently available data to assess the potential utility of NOACs in patients with AF and kidney failure on hemodialysis, providing further insight into this important clinical issue.2METHODS2.1Data sourcesThis meta‐analysis was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses Protocols Statement of 2015.\n19\n The review protocol was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO; registration number CRD42022374674). Two authors (TYC, CYL) independently searched the PubMed, Medline, and Cochrane Collaboration Central Register of Controlled Trials databases for studies published between January 2005 and June 2022, and any discrepancies were resolved by a third author (TFC). A combination of keywords or medical terms related to hemodialysis (e.g., dialysis, kidney failure), AF, and anticoagulation (e.g., oral anticoagulation, NOAC, Direct oral thrombin inhibitors, factor Xa inhibitors, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and Edoxaban) was used.2.2Selection criteria and data extractionWe included only registered randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the efficacy and safety outcomes of NOACs and VKAs among AF patients with kidney failure receiving hemodialysis. Two authors (TYC, CYL) extracted the data independently, and any discrepancies were resolved via a third author (TFC) (Figure 1).FIGURE 1Systematic review study inclusion and exclusion criteria.The principal efficacy and safety outcomes of the three analyzed studies are listed in Table 1. Individual outcomes included ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, clinically relevant non‐major bleeding (CRNB), major bleeding, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), CV mortality, and all‐cause mortality.TABLE 1Summary of enrolled randomized controlled trials and analysis of principal endpoint.Study, yearAXADIA‐AFNET 8 study, 2022RENAL‐AF trial, 2022Valkyrie study, 2021Enrolled patients97154132Age (mean)74.76879.9Male68 (70.1%)98 (63.6%)88 (66.7%)BMI28.6‐24.9CHA2DS2‐VASc score4.544.7HAS‐BLED score4.2‐4.7ESRD100%100%100%Type of NOACApixabanApixabanRivaroxabanDose (Apixaban, twice/day, Rivaroxaban, daily)2.5 mg\n55 patients (71%) 5 mg\n22 patients (29%) 2.5 mg\n10 mgTarget INR2–32–32–3TTR50.7%44%48%Antiplatelet drug33 (34%)64 (42.9%)46 (34.8%)Hypertension‐146 (94.8%)‐Old MI21 (21.7%)38 (24.7%)61 (46.2%)Heart failure‐84 (54.5%)41 (31.1%)Diabetes Mellitus‐89 (57.8%)62 (47%)Paroxysmal AF—85 (55.2%)60 (45.5%)Old stroke‐29 (18.8%)40 (30.3%)Principal efficacy endpointMI, ischemic stroke, all‐cause death, and deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolismAll‐cause deathfatal cardiovascular disease and non‐fatal stroke, cardiac events, and other vascular eventsPrincipal safety endpointAll‐cause death, major bleeding events and CRNBMajor bleeding events and CRNBLife‐threatening and major bleeding eventsCRNBISTH consensusISTH consensusNon‐fatal, non‐major bleedingFollow‐up (years)1.270.921.88Abbreviations: AF, atrial fibrillation; BMI, body mass index; CRNB, clinically relevant non‐major bleeding; ESRD, end‐stage renal disease; INR, international normalized ratio; ISTH, International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis; MI, myocardial infarction; NOAC, Non‐vitamin K oral anticoagulants; TTR, time in therapeutic range.2.3Statistical analysisTo explore the associations between NOAC/warfarin and outcomes of interest, we calculated relative risks (RRs) and related 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for binary variables, and mean differences and related 95% CIs for continuous variables. Pooled estimates with 95% CIs were estimated using inverse‐variance weighted random‐effects models with the DerSimonian and Laird estimators for interstudy variances (τ\n2). Continuity correction was used to calculate individual study results and conduct a meta‐analysis based on the inverse‐variance method. To quantify heterogeneity, I\n2 statistics and τ\n2 were assessed. Studies were considered heterogeneous if I\n2 was >50% or p was <0.05 for τ\n2. The results of the meta‐analysis are displayed visually using forest plots (Figure 2A,B). All analyses were performed using RStudio (version 1.2.1335).FIGURE 2Forest plot of (A) principal efficacy endpoints and (B) principal safety endpoints.3RESULTSTable 1 summarizes the characteristics of enrolled studies.\n20\n, \n21\n, \n22\n The three trials included a total of 383 patients (88 on rivaroxaban, 130 on apixaban) with a mean age ranging from 68 to 80 years. The mean CHA2DS2‐VASc score was 4.7 in the Valkyrie study, 4 in the RENAL‐AF trial, and 4.5 in the AXADIA‐AFNET 8 study.\n20\n, \n21\n, \n22\n The RENAL‐AF trial and the AXADIA‐AFNET 8 study adopted the standard CRNB criteria defined by the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis. The Valkyrie study defined minor bleeding as bleeding that was neither fatal nor a major event. The mean follow‐up duration ranged from 0.9 to 1.9 years.The results of this study are presented in Figures 2 and 3. No significant differences were observed in the principal efficacy or safety endpoint between hemodialysis patients receiving NOACs versus VKAs. Regarding individual outcomes, no significant intergroup differences were observed in the risks of hemorrhagic stroke, major bleeding, CRNB, ACS, CV mortality, or all‐cause mortality. Although a trend toward decreased risk of ischemic stroke was observed in patients receiving NOACs, the difference did not reach statistical significance (RR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.17–1.04).FIGURE 3Forest plots of: (A) ischemic stroke; (B) ACS; (C) CV mortality; (D) all‐cause mortality; (E) hemorrhagic stroke; (F) major bleeding; and (G) CRNB.

Unlike previous meta‐analyses that incorporated observational studies and patients at various stages of chronic kidney disease, the present study exclusively focused on RCTs involving patients with end‐stage renal disease on hemodialysis, a population that has been underrepresented in earlier research. Our findings suggest that the efficacy and safety of NOACs are comparable to those of warfarin in preventing acute coronary syndrome (ACS), cardiovascular mortality, all‐cause mortality, hemorrhagic stroke, major bleeding, and clinically relevant non‐major bleeding (CRNB). Furthermore, while there was a trend toward a reduction in ischemic stroke with NOACs compared to warfarin, this difference did not reach statistical significance.4.1Use of VKAs in patients on hemodialysisVKAs, such as warfarin, are commonly prescribed for patients with AF. However, the use of VKAs in dialysis patients is associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Previous studies investigating the effects of VKAs in this population have yielded conflicting results.\n10\n, \n14\n, \n17\n, \n23\n, \n24\n, \n25\n, \n26\n, \n27\n, \n28\n Some studies suggested a reduced risk of stroke\n14\n or a survival benefit\n23\n, \n29\n, \n30\n with VKA use compared to no oral anticoagulant therapy, while other studies found no protective effect of VKAs on stroke risk or all‐cause mortality.\n17\n, \n25\n, \n26\n, \n27\n, \n28\n, \n31\n\nA meta‐analysis involving more than 9000 dialysis patients with AF found that VKA treatment was associated with a 1.2‐fold increased risk of stroke (95% CI, 0.8–1.9).\n24\n Additionally, several studies have reported an increased risk of bleeding with VKA use.\n28\n, \n32\n Contributing factors such as pre‐existing platelet dysfunction, routine heparinization during hemodialysis, and suboptimal time in therapeutic range (TTR) may exacerbate this bleeding risk.\n33\n, \n34\n In the current RCTs included in our analysis, the mean TTR in the VKA groups was consistently low, ranging from 44% to 50.7% (AXADIA‐AFNET 8 study, RENAL‐AF trial, and Valkyrie study), with patients being three times more likely to be subtherapeutic (international normalized ratio [INR] <2.0) than supratherapeutic (INR >3.0). The efficacy of warfarin may be compromised by a low TTR, and bleeding risks could increase if conventional TTR targets were achieved. Nonetheless, the low TTR observed in these trials also underscores the potential advantage of NOACs in this population.4.2Use of NOACs in patients on dialysisIn a large retrospective cohort study that included over 25,000 patients from the United States Renal Data System, standard‐dose apixaban (5 mg twice daily) was associated with significantly lower rates of stroke, systemic embolism, and mortality compared to both warfarin and low‐dose apixaban (2.5 mg twice daily). Furthermore, both dosing regimens of apixaban (5 mg or 2.5 mg twice daily) demonstrated lower rates of major bleeding compared to warfarin, with the standard‐dose apixaban (5 mg twice daily) also being associated with reduced rates of thromboembolic events and mortality.A recently published meta‐analysis, which included data from three RCTs and three observational studies, reported comparable outcomes between patients treated with NOACs and those treated with VKAs. The rates of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism (relative risk [RR]: 0.65, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.38–1.10), major bleeding events (RR: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.49–1.28), and all‐cause mortality (RR: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.56–1.12) were similar between the two groups. As compared with our study, in addition to ischemic stroke and bleeding events, we further reported the principal efficacy and safety endpoints, cardiovascular events including acute coronary syndrome and cardiovascular death. Moreover, we demonstrated the high number of deaths and bleeding events relative to ischemic stroke events in the result of pooled NOAC and VKA study groups, which raises the need for more holistic and integrated AF management in hemodialysis patients, such as shared decision making in the prescription of anticoagulants.The current meta‐analysis demonstrated that NOACs provide efficacy and safety outcomes comparable to warfarin. However, interstudy heterogeneity was observed in the analysis of trial‐defined efficacy endpoints, largely driven by the reduced efficacy outcomes reported in the Valkyrie study, which included fatal cardiovascular disease, non‐fatal stroke, cardiac events, and other vascular events as principal efficacy endpoints. In contrast, the AXADIA‐AFNET 8 study defined efficacy endpoints as thromboembolic events, including myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, all‐cause mortality, and deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism. Since the RENAL‐AF trial was not designed to evaluate efficacy, the current analysis used all‐cause mortality as a surrogate endpoint.4.3Recommendations of guidelines about oral anticoagulants in AF patients on hemodialysisThe JCS/JHRS 2024 Guideline Focused Update on Management of Cardiac Arrhythmias stated that warfarin is not recommended for patients on dialysis (class III recommendation).\n35\n Also, the prior JCS/JHRS 2020 Guideline on Pharmacotherapy of Cardiac Arrhythmias stated that NOACs are contraindicated in patients on dialysis, and so is warfarin except in some cases, such as the perioperative period of AF ablation, mechanical valves, and for secondary stroke prevention.\n36\n The “weak” recommendations of routine use of OACs (either warfarin or NOACs) in AF patients on dialysis are mainly due to the lack of high‐quality trials demonstrating the positive net clinical benefits of OACs compared to non‐anticoagulation in this population at a high bleeding risk. In 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation, the use of warfarin or apixaban in AF patients on dialysis was a class IIb recommendation.\n37\n Apixaban was listed based on the results of some retrospective analyses of databases and the trials of apixaban compared to warfarin, rather than any randomized trials of apixaban compared to non‐anticoagulation. This issue would remain controversial until the randomized trials are available which directly compare NOACs to warfarin in AF patients on hemodialysis. Based on current guideline recommendations and the findings of the present study, NOACs may be considered only for secondary stroke prevention in AF patients on hemodialysis (as suggested by the 2020 JCS/JHRS guidelines), with apixaban and rivaroxaban being the preferred choices among NOACs—and likely preferred over warfarin—once the decision to initiate anticoagulation is made.4.4Holistic management of AF patients with kidney failure receiving hemodialysisAmong patients across three RCTs, 144 individuals (37.6%) died, 61 (15.9%) experienced a major bleeding event, 88 (23%) suffered a CRNB event, and 17 patients (4.4%) experienced an ischemic stroke (Figure 4). A recently published meta‐analysis further corroborated these findings, highlighting a high incidence of both minor and major bleeding events as well as all‐cause mortality.\n38\n The substantial burden of deaths and bleeding complications compared to ischemic stroke events underscores the necessity of a more comprehensive and integrated approach to AF management, particularly for patients with AF and kidney failure undergoing hemodialysis. In this context, the ABC (Atrial fibrillation Better Care) pathway has been proposed as an integrated management strategy aiming at reducing AF‐related mortality, morbidity, and hospitalizations.\n39\n\n4.5Study limitationWe included three RCTs in our analysis: the VALKYRIE study, the RENAL‐AF trial, and the AXADIA‐AFNET 8 study. There were several limitations of the present study. First, the limited number of patients, which may lead to an underpowered analysis, is a major limitation of our study. However, only these three RCTs are currently available in the literature for a meta‐analysis assessing the efficacy and safety of NOACs versus VKAs in AF patients on hemodialysis. Therefore, despite the small sample size, we believe the findings remain important, as this is a clinical issue we frequently encounter in daily practice. At the very least, the available data can help inform our discussions with patients and support shared decision making. Second, apixaban and rivaroxaban are distinct drugs with differing pharmacokinetics, administration methods, and clinical indications, so these differences might have influenced the pooled results. However, separate analysis would be difficult to provide more information due to the limited enrolled trials and patient number (1 rivaroxaban trial and 2 apixaban trials). Furthermore, the consistently low time in the therapeutic range observed in these trials reflects the real‐world quality of VKA therapy in this patient population. To address these limitations, a meta‐analysis was conducted to integrate findings across the studies, offering a more comprehensive perspective that may inform future clinical care.5CONCLUSIONOur results suggest that NOACs (rivaroxaban or apixaban) are as safe and effective as VKAs in patients with AF and kidney failure receiving hemodialysis. Even on oral anticoagulants, these patients remain at high risk of cardiovascular events and all‐cause mortality. Integrated care and holistic management are important for this high‐risk population.FUNDING INFORMATIONThis study was supported, in part, by research grants from the Taipei Veterans General Hospital (V108C‐055, V109C‐008, V110C‐004, V111C‐075), Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan (MOST 111‐2314‐B‐075‐007‐MY3, 113‐2628‐B‐075‐003‐MY3, 113‐2314‐B‐075‐029‐MY3), SZU‐YUAN RESEARCH FOUNDATION OF INTERNAL MEDICINE (108010, 109024, 110008, 111003, 111050), and “Yin Yen‐Liang Foundation Development and Construction Plan” of the College of Medicine, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University.CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENTThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}

Guidelines recommend vitamin K antagonists (VKA) for thromboprophylaxis in adult CHD, as trial data comparing safety/efficacy of direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) to VKA are not available in this population.MethodsPubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were searched for trials comparing DOAC with VKA in patients with ACHD. Outcomes of interest were efficacy endpoints (thromboembolic complications) and safety endpoints (bleeding complications). Results were meta-analyzed and sensitivity analyses were performed.ResultsA total of 4 retrospective studies comprising 6004 patients (2566 DOAC, 3438 VKA) were analyzed. Compared with VKA, DOAC did not cause a statistically significant difference in incidence of thromboembolism (risk ratio, RR, 0.76; 95% confidence intervals, CI, 0.28, 2.07); composite bleeding (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.71, 1.47); major bleeding (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.92, 1.21); minor bleeding (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.51, 2.44); or intracranial bleeding (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.50, 1.46). Numerically, the DOAC arm had fewer thromboembolisms/intracranial bleeds but more major/composite bleeds. However, upon removal of the largest study, the DOAC arm had fewer major/composite bleeds.ConclusionsDOAC did not confer a significant increase in either thromboembolic or bleeding risk as compared with VKA. Sensitivity analysis showed notable heterogeneity among studies.

Currently, > 90% of children diagnosed with complex CHD are expected to survive to adulthood [1]. CHD itself is a very broad umbrella term encompassing multiple diagnoses; the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines defines “simple,” “moderate,” and “complex” categories of CHD. Examples of simple CHD include isolated small atrial or ventricular septal defect, whereas complex CHD includes any form of cyanotic heart disease irrespective of palliation status, presence of Fontan circuit, single-ventricle physiology of all types, and all forms of transposition of the great arteries, including congenitally corrected [1].Patients with adult CHD have significantly elevated risk of stroke and systemic thromboembolism compared with the general population [2]. Atrial tachyarrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation (AF), atrial flutter (AFL), and intra-atrial reentrant tachycardia, are common sequelae of surgical repair, as they frequently arise from suture lines or surgical scar sites. The frequently used congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 years (doubled), diabetes, stroke (doubled), vascular disease, age 65–74 years, and sex category (CHA2DS2-VASc) scoring system for determining utility of oral anticoagulant prophylaxis in AF/AFL does not account for CHD, and therefore underestimates stroke risk in young adults who may technically have a score of 0. Patients with adult CHD may also have elevated thromboembolic risk owing to the presence of residual prosthetic material, and especially in the setting of Fontan physiology; this is because of the chronic venous stasis entailed by creation of a completely passive conduit from the vena cava to the pulmonary artery. Conversely, Fontan patients are at increased risk of cirrhosis due to chronic hepatic congestion, which in turn leads to elevated bleeding risk, further complicating the decision to anticoagulate.Limited evidence exists regarding oral anticoagulant selection in adult CHD, given its relative rarity and the paucity of randomized clinical trials in this population. The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) 2020 Guidelines for the Management of Adult Congenital Heart Disease recommend lifelong prophylactic anticoagulation in patients with AF and CHD (class I if complex and class IIa if moderate), as well as in Fontan patients with any prior history of thromboembolic event, atrial thrombus, or atrial arrhythmia (class I) [3]. However, routine anticoagulation in cyanotic/Fontan patients without the aforementioned risk factors is not recommended, as the benefit is unknown. Additionally, the ESC guidelines currently recommend only vitamin K antagonists (VKA) in Fontan patients, given the lack of prospective efficacy data for direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) in this population. The guidelines recommend an “individualized approach” regarding VKA versus DOAC in non-Fontan moderate or complex CHD patients requiring oral anticoagulation for AF. The ACC/AHA recommendations are identical [1, 3].In general adult cardiology, DOAC is routinely recommended over VKA for thromboprophylaxis in most clinical scenarios other than mechanical prosthetic valves and rheumatic mitral valve disease [4]. DOACs may be advantageous over VKA in patients with adult CHD given their ease of use and more stable serum concentration, especially in a young population that may require lifelong anticoagulation. DOACs also have a more favorable risk profile in the general adult population, although it is unknown if this holds true in patients with CHD given their abnormal physiology. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of all studies directly comparing DOAC with VKA in patients with adult CHD. The goal of this review was to assess the safety and efficacy of DOAC in adult CHD compared with the standard of care.MethodsLiterature review was conducted in accordance with Cochrane Collaboration guidelines [5]. Results were reported according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [6].1. Data Sources and SearchA systematic search was conducted independently by authors A.S. and E.W. in Pubmed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. Search phrases included “congenital heart disease,” “CHD,” “DOAC,” “NOAC,” “warfarin,” and “VKA.” The date of the last literature search was 17 May 2024. Detailed search strategy is provided in the Supplementary Information. Search results were managed using Rayyan®, a web-based screening tool for systematic reviews [7].2. Study SelectionInclusion criteria consisted of: (1) studies that were randomized controlled trials (RCT) or observational studies with study populations of age > 18 years with a diagnosis of adult CHD; (2) indication for anticoagulation that was directly related to adult CHD (e.g., for AF secondary to Fontan or other surgical repair, anticoagulation for mechanical valves not included); (3) reporting of at least one safety or efficacy outcome; (4) reporting of at least one outcome of interest as a direct comparison between a DOAC arm and a VKA arm. Studies were excluded if they did not meet the inclusion criteria or were single-arm registries. Conference abstracts were excluded. No restrictions were applied to sample size, follow-up duration, or patient characteristics outside of the adult CHD requirement.3. Quality Assessment and Data ExtractionAll studies resulting from the literature search were imported into Rayyan reference management software. Authors A.S., J.K., and F.I. independently screened all study titles and abstracts, then performed full-text screening of eligible studies. There were no disagreements requiring adjudication. Quality assessment was performed using signaling questions for observational studies, as no randomized controlled trials met inclusion criteria [8, 9]. Risk of bias assessment was performed by authors A.S., J.K., and F.I.4. Outcome MeasuresThe efficacy outcome was composite thromboembolic events (stroke/transient ischemic attack, pulmonary embolism, any other major organ or arterial thromboembolism, and in situ cardiac thrombus). Safety outcomes included total bleeding, major bleeding, minor bleeding, and intracranial bleeding. Study-level definitions of “major” and “minor” bleeding were used. One included study used the International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH) criteria, while the rest set their own definitions on the basis of ISTH criteria (typically, hospitalization resulting from bleeding, bleeding into a major organ/muscle compartment, or hemoglobin drop > 2 g/dL).5. Statistical AnalysesOutcomes of interest are reported in the form aggregated risk ratios (RR) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). The Mantel–Haenszel method was used to calculate RR. A two-tailed p-value < 0.05 was used as the cutoff for statistical significance. The I2 heterogeneity estimate was used to measure the proportion of total variability in the meta-analysis. I2 < 40% was set as the cutoff for low heterogeneity, for which we used the fixed effects model for outcomes. For outcomes with high heterogeneity (I2 > 40%), the random effects model was used [10].Sensitivity analysis was performed by removing one study at a time and assessing the impact on RR. Statistical analysis was performed using Review Manager (Version 5.4, Copenhagen: The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, 2020) [11].ResultsThe systematic literature search generated 1359 records. After de-duplication and full-text review, 4 studies comprising 6004 patients (2566 on DOAC, 3438 on VKA) met inclusion criteria and were analyzed [12–15]. Figure 1 shows the PRISMA diagram detailing the review process. Table 1 presents the indications for anticoagulation in the analyzed study populations. Additional study characteristics and baseline characteristics of the included study populations can be found in the Supplementary Information. All studies that met inclusion criteria were prospective or retrospective observational cohort studies with a moderate risk of bias. No RCTs meeting inclusion criteria were identified, because to date no RCT comparing DOAC with VKA in patients with adult CHD has been performed. Additionally, the major DOAC landmark trials (RE-LY, ENGAGE-AF TIMI 48, GLORIA-AF, ARISTOTLE) were analyzed as snowballs to assess whether any data on adult CHD subpopulations could be isolated from the patient characteristics supplements. However, while these trials did not specifically list CHD as an exclusion criterion, no patients with adult CHD were included among their subjects [16–19].Fig. 1Search strategy in different databases (PRISMA diagram)Table 1Indications for anticoagulation in the tested study populationsIndication for anticoagulationStudyN (%)Egbe et al.Freisinger et al.Kawamatsu et al.Kazerouninia et al.Atrial arrhythmia109 (83.8%)4293 (66%)22 (28.5%)67 (43.2%)DOAC: 12 (33.3%)VKA: 10 (24.4%)DOAC: 24 (50%)VKA: 43 (40.2%)Deep vein thrombosis–488 (7.5%)––Pulmonary embolism (including history of)6 (4.6%)429 (6.6%)––Intracardiac thrombus4 (3.1%)–––Stroke3 (2.3%)–––Unspecified thrombosis––15 (19.5%)50 (32.2%)DOAC: 11 (30.6%)VKA: 4 (9.8%)DOAC: 11 (22.9%)VKA: 39 (36.4%)Mechanical prosthetic valve29 (22.3%)–––Periprocedural44 (33.8%)––9 (5.8%)DOAC: 8 (16.7%)VKA: 1 (0.9%)Empiric––26 (33.8%)14DOAC: 0VKA: 26 (63.4%)DOAC:0VKA: 14 (13.1%)1. Efficacy OutcomesThe primary efficacy endpoint of composite thromboembolic events was reported in 3 out of 4 analyzed studies, comprising 5875 patients [16–18]. There were 233 events in the DOAC arm versus 248 events in the VKA arm. The difference was not statistically significant: RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.28, 2.07; p = 0.59; and I2 = 57%. The random effects model was used for this outcome owing to high heterogeneity.2. Safety OutcomesThe primary safety endpoint of major bleeding was reported in all 4 of the analyzed studies, comprising 6004 patients [12–15]. There were 310 events in the DOAC arm versus 390 events in the VKA arm. The difference was not statistically significant: RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.92, 1.21; p = 0.46; and I2 = 0%. The fixed effect model was used for this outcome owing to low heterogeneity.The secondary safety endpoint of composite bleeding was reported in 3 of the 4 analyzed studies, comprising 5875 patients [12–14]. There were 424 events in the DOAC arm versus 524 events in the VKA arm. The difference was not statistically significant: RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.71, 1.47; p = 0.91; and I2 = 49%.The secondary safety endpoint of intracranial bleeding was reported in 2 of the 4 analyzed studies, comprising 5720 patients [12, 13]. There were 22 events in the DOAC arm versus 33 events in the VKA arm. The difference was not statistically significant: RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.50, 1.45; p = 0.73; and I2 = 9%. The fixed effect model was used for this outcome owing to low heterogeneity.The secondary safety endpoint of minor bleeding was reported in 2 of the 4 analyzed studies, comprising 232 patients [14, 15]. There were 12 events in the DOAC arm versus 22 events in the VKA arm. The difference was not statistically significant: RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.60, 2.08; p = 0.56; and I2 = 0%. The fixed effect model was used for this outcome owing to low heterogeneity.Table 2 summarizes the results.

Subgroup AnalysisWe additionally performed subgroup analysis to assess for any difference between Fontan and non-Fontan patients with regard to safety and efficacy endpoints, given the increased risk of both bleeding and thromboembolism conferred by Fontan physiology. The studies by Kawamatsu et al. and Kazerouninia et al. composed the Fontan subgroup, as both these studies tested Fontan patients only. While the study by Egbe et al. included only tetralogy of Fallot patients and no Fontans, the study by Freisinger et al. did include some single-ventricle patients; however, these composed only 2.4% of the study population, so we treated it as a non-Fontan study.Major bleeding was the only outcome which was tested in all four studies. There was no statistically significant difference in major bleeding between DOAC and VKA in either the Fontan subgroup (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.11, 2.67; p = 0.16; I2 = 49%) or the non-Fontan subgroup (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.33, 2.39; p = 0.25; I2 = 24%). Testing for subgroup differences was also statistically insignificant with p = 0.61 (χ2 = 0.26, I2 = 0%). Figure 3 shows the Forest plots for the Fontan versus non-Fontan subgroup analysis comparing DOAC with VKA for the outcome of major bleeding.Fig. 3Subgroup analysis comparing Fontan with non-Fontan patients for the outcome of major bleedingEgbe et al. did not test for composite bleeding or composite thromboembolism, thus, for these outcomes, the Fontan subgroup only contained data from Freisinger et al. For composite bleeding, there was no statistically significant difference between DOAC and VKA in either the Fontan subgroup (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.14, 2.94; p = 0.04; I2 = 76%) or the non-Fontan subgroup (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.95, 1.21; p = 0.26). Testing for subgroup differences was also statistically insignificant with p = 0.51 (χ2 = 0.44, I2 = 0%).For composite thromboembolism, there was no statistically significant difference between DOAC and VKA in the Fontan subgroup (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.11, 1.10; p = 0.27; I2 = 17%). However, in the non-Fontan subgroup, there was a statistically significant increase in thromboembolism in the DOAC arm as compared with VKA (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.07, 1.57; p = 0.007). This resulted in a statistically significant subgroup difference between Fontan and non-Fontan: p = 0.03 (χ2 = 4.89, I2 = 79.5%).Supplementary Fig. 5 shows the Forest plots for the Fontan versus non-Fontan subgroup analysis comparing DOAC with VKA for the outcomes of composite bleeding and composite thromboembolism.DiscussionTo our best knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis directly comparing DOAC with VKA for thromboprophylaxis in the adult CHD population. One of the major findings is that there is no statistically significant difference between DOAC and VKA in either prevention of thromboembolism or risk of bleeding (of any severity). The exception was that upon subgroup analysis comparing Fontan vs. non-Fontan patients, the Fontans demonstrated a statistically significant increase in thromboembolism on DOAC over VKA. However, the generalizability of this finding is unclear given that the entire Fontan subgroup came from a single study. Numerically, the DOAC arm contained more major, minor, and composite bleeds. However, when sensitivity analysis was performed by removing the largest study, the DOAC arm contained fewer major, minor, and composite bleeds. Sensitivity analysis did not cause any of the tested outcomes to achieve statistical significance.1. Implications for Clinical PracticeThis meta-analysis provides evidence supporting the use of DOAC as an alternative to VKA in patients with adult CHD requiring anticoagulation for either thromboprophylaxis due to atrial arrhythmia or treatment of existing thrombus/thromboembolism.2. Comparisons with Published LiteratureWhile there has never been an RCT comparing DOAC with VKA for thromboprophylaxis in adult CHD, the vast majority of data on safety/utility of DOAC in this special population derive from the large-scale prospective study by Freisinger et al. (which was included in this meta-analysis) and the single-arm NOTE registry [16, 20].The first outcomes data on patients with adult CHD taking DOAC were published as small, single-center, single-arm registries without a VKA control arm: Pujol et al. (2016) with 75 patients and Georgekutty et al. (2018) with 21 patients. These, along with the later study by Bras et al. (published 2021 and containing 95 patients), showed extremely low incidences of thromboembolic and cumulative bleeding events over a short (~ 1-year) follow-up period [21–23]. Of note, while most patients in all these studies required anticoagulation for atrial arrhythmia, there was a wide spectrum of CHD severity, with Pujol et al. containing only 21% complex CHD, whereas all patients in Georgekutty et al. had Fontan circulation. NOTE was a landmark, international, multicenter registry involving 35 facilities in 13 countries, which followed 530 patients over a 2-year follow-up period; 85% of the patients had moderate or complex CHD; a subsequent substudy assessed Fontan patients specifically [20, 24]. A unique feature of the NOTE registry was the use of a historical control arm owing to a high percentage of patients who were previously on VKA but transitioned to DOAC. Both the original NOTE registry and the Fontan substudy showed low rates of both thromboembolism and bleeding on DOAC (~ 1% per patient-year), with no significant change in either outcome in comparison with historical VKA use [20, 24]. The PROTECT-AR study, a recent (2024) four-center Greek study including 218 patients, showed similar results, including a lack of significant difference between DOAC and historic VKA control [25].However, Freisinger et al. remains the largest study to date that was designed with contemporaneous intervention (DOAC) and control (VKA) arms, and it challenged the findings of the previous single-arm studies by demonstrating statistically significant increases in thromboembolism, MACE, bleeding, and all-cause mortality with the use of DOAC as compared with VKA [16, 20–22, 24]. It is notable that while the other 3 studies included in this meta-analysis showed conflicting results, they consisted of only 361 patients as opposed to 5643 from Freisinger et al. [16–19]. Nevertheless, despite their low weightage upon meta-analysis, the outcomes from these studies were enough to remove the statistical significance between DOAC and VKA.It is also important to mention the SAXOPHONE and ENNOBLE-ATE trials, both open-label, randomized controlled trials comparing DOAC with VKA in children. Although these trials did not meet criteria for inclusion in our meta-analysis owing to their pediatric study populations, they provide valuable complementary data [26, 27]. SAXOPHONE randomized 192 patients in a 2:1 apixaban: standard of care (VKA/heparin) ratio, with 129 patients receiving apixaban and 63 receiving VKA or heparin. Apixaban was dosed to target a plasma level correlating to that of adults in the flagship ARISTOTLE trial [15]. Only safety outcomes were tested, with the DOAC arm having numerically more clinically relevant bleeds, but not reaching statistical significance (difference 4.0%, 95% CI − 12.8 to 0.8) [26]. Results were based on an intention-to-treat analysis. Of note, while the SAXOPHONE trial was intended to collect safety data in the pediatric population that was lacking compared with the adult population, the indications for anticoagulation were markedly different in SAXOPHONE. Specifically, whereas all the flagship adult trials lacked significant numbers of CHD, the indication for anticoagulation in 74% of SAXOPHONE participants was single-ventricle physiology. However, 70% of SAXOPHONE participants were < 12 years of age, with 24% between 12 and 18 years. Therefore, while it may be possible to extrapolate the trial results to the adult CHD population on the basis of the underlying pathology, the predominantly preadolescent patient population limits the comparison.ENNOBLE-ATE compared edoxaban with VKA/heparin in patients < 18 years old, with a 2:1 randomization structure and intention-to-treat analysis similar to that of SAXOPHONE. 44% of the study population had a history of Fontan palliation, with the remainder requiring anticoagulation in setting of Kawasaki disease or heart failure. Ultimately, 109 patients were randomized to edoxaban and 58 to VKA/heparin. The edoxaban arm had numerically fewer thromboembolic events, composite bleeding events, and major bleeding events than the VKA/heparin arm, but the results were not statistically significant [27].Lastly, in 2023 Van den Eynde et al. published a network meta-analysis comparing aspirin versus VKA versus DOAC versus no thromboprophylaxis in Fontan patients, with composite thrombotic events as the efficacy outcome and major bleeding as the safety outcome [28]. A total of 21 studies were included, of which 15 tested VKA versus aspirin, 1 tested DOAC alone (NOTE registry), 1 tested DOAC versus aspirin, 2 tested VKA versus DOAC versus aspirin, and 2 did not specify type of antithrombotic therapy used. Only one of these studies (Kawamatsu et al.) was included in our meta-analysis; the other study with a VKA versus DOAC comparison had only 3 patients on DOAC versus 88 on warfarin; we included a later version, albeit still without balanced VKA and DOAC arms [17, 19]. Overall, this network analysis showed DOAC > VKA > aspirin > no thromboprophylaxis in preventing thrombotic outcomes, and aspirin > no thromboprophylaxis > DOAC > VKA in preventing major bleeding outcomes. However, the methodology precludes a direct comparison between DOAC and VKA, as the number of patients on DOAC was extremely small (1.2% of patient-years).An important point is that despite the conflicting results of the above studies, many of them that utilized German national insurance data found that from the time DOACs went on the market, their use in patients with adult CHD needing anticoagulation rapidly increased from 5% to > 40% in under 10 years [16, 23, 26]. These trends reflect how in real-world practice, DOACs’ ease of use combined with lack of data proving inferiority to VKA supersedes the fact that there are not enough data to confirm noninferiority.3. Future PerspectivesMoving forward, large-scale randomized controlled trials comparing DOAC with VKA in patients with adult CHD will need to be conducted. To optimally inform guidelines as well as clinical decision-making, these should include analysis of multiple subgroups: Fontan versus non-Fontan, simple versus moderate versus complex CHD, and indications for anticoagulation that include atrial arrhythmia, thromboembolic events, or Fontan conduit prophylaxis.Of note, in 2024 Al Yousef et al. published data on anticoagulant usage among 3501 patients with adult CHD followed from 1995 to 2018 [29]. Compared with patients on VKA, patients on DOAC had higher rates of both VTE (94 versus 74) and major bleeding (58 versus 18). No statistical analysis was given. These data were not included in this meta-analysis as they were published only as a conference abstract. Publication of the full results will likely contribute further information on the topic.4. LimitationsAs with all studies, ours has inherent limitations. The most significant limitation is the absence of any randomized controlled trials comparing DOAC with VKA in the adult CHD population. While pooled meta-analysis of observational studies is inferior to meta-analysis of RCTs, it serves as the next best level of evidence on this subject. Another major limitation is that the outcomes data were heavily weighted toward the Freisinger study, which contributed 5643 of the 6004 patients analyzed (94%). When sensitivity analysis was performed by removing the Freisinger study, there was no statistically significant change in outcomes. However, this may be ascribed to the very small study population of the remaining three studies, which would likely be underpowered to achieve statistical significance for any of the tested outcomes. Subgroup analysis of Fontan versus non-Fontan patients was likewise limited by the Fontan subgroup containing much fewer patients than the non-Fontan subgroup, as the latter consisted practically entirely of patients from the Freisinger study. Lastly, a minor limitation was the inability to perform subgroup analysis by different types of DOAC.ConclusionsDOAC did not confer a statistically significant increase in either thromboembolic or bleeding risk when compared with VKA in patients with adult CHD requiring anticoagulation. These findings may support their use as an alternative to VKA. Large-scale randomized controlled trials comparing DOAC with VKA in this special patient population are needed.Supplementary InformationBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material.Supplementary file1 (DOCX 29498 KB)"}

Supported by the 2023 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines and the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of rapid optimization of heart failure (STRONG-HF) trial, SGLT2i offer improved outcomes with a favorable safety profile, emphasizing their pivotal role in HFrEF management. The aim of this study was to evaluate early initiation with dapagliflozin and empagliflozin, focusing on their efficacy and safety in acute heart failure (AHF). Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we searched seven databases for randomized controlled trials on SGLT2i in AHF (2019-2024). Outcomes included all-cause mortality, heart failure (HF)-related events, all-cause rehospitalization, length of hospital stay, diuretic response, serum electrolytes, and adverse events (AEs). The Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool was used. Data were analyzed using a random-effects model and presented as standardized mean differences and risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals. A subgroup analysis was conducted based on intervention. Nine studies encompassing 1,417 patients with a generally low risk of bias were included. Initiating SGLT2i within five days of admission significantly reduced in-hospital all-cause mortality risk by 42% and in-hospital worsening HF during rehospitalization by 39%. SGLT2i also significantly reduced serious AEs risk by 27%. No significant differences were found in other outcomes, including specific AEs (acute kidney injury, hepatic injury, symptomatic hypotension, hypoglycemia, urinary tract infections, and diabetic ketoacidosis). The analysis showed homogeneity, with no significant differences between SGLT2i. The study highlights that initiating SGLT2i within five days of admission significantly reduces all-cause mortality and worsening HF during rehospitalization, with a better safety profile than placebo.", "body": "IntroductionAcute heart failure (AHF) poses a significant and growing global health challenge, particularly among individuals aged 65 and older, leading to over one million hospital admissions annually in the United States alone [1]. The incidence of AHF increases with age, peaking between 70 and 73 years, where the management becomes increasingly complex due to the interplay of multiple chronic conditions and geriatric syndromes [2,3]. Despite advancements in medical care, AHF continues to contribute substantially to morbidity and mortality, highlighting an urgent need for more effective therapeutic strategies.Traditionally, AHF management has focused on symptomatic relief and hemodynamic stabilization, offering limited options to alter the disease trajectory [4,5]. However, the therapeutic landscape is transforming with the introduction of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), specifically dapagliflozin and empagliflozin. Initially developed for glycemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), these agents have demonstrated significant cardiovascular benefits that extend beyond glucose lowering [6,7]. Recent landmark trials have unveiled the potential of SGLT2i in reducing mortality, hospitalization rates, and symptom burden in heart failure (HF) patients, irrespective of their diabetic status [7]. A study reported that early initiation of SGLT2i post-AHF hospitalization significantly lowers the risk of all-cause mortality and HF events within the first nine months after discharge [6]. Similarly, another study found that starting SGLT2i during hospitalization for acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) improves post-discharge outcomes. Monzo et al. [8] further confirmed the broad clinical applicability of these agents, demonstrating benefits across various ejection fractions and care settings. Despite these promising findings, critical questions remain regarding the optimal timing for initiating SGLT2i in AHF and the full extent of their therapeutic benefits. Early intervention with dapagliflozin and empagliflozin can enhance patient outcomes and redefine treatment paradigms in AHF management.The aim of this study was to evaluate the early initiation of SGLT2i (dapagliflozin and empagliflozin) in AHF comprehensively. By synthesizing data from multiple studies, this study sought to address critical clinical questions about the timing of initiation, impact on patient outcomes, and potential adverse events (AEs). Through rigorous analysis, this study might offer clear evidence to support clinical decision-making and potentially reshape current treatment guidelines, emphasizing the importance of early intervention with dapagliflozin and empagliflozin in AHF management.MethodsThis systematic review and meta-analysis adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guideline and was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO); registration number CRD42024585838 [9].Database and literature searchA comprehensive literature search was conducted on July 22, 2024, across multiple electronic databases: PubMed, ProQuest, SAGE Journals, EBSCOhost, Wiley Online Library, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Library. The search strategy employed a combination of relevant keywords and medical subject headings (MeSH) terms, including “sodium-glucose transporter 2 inhibitors,” “dapagliflozin,” “empagliflozin,” “acute heart failure,” and “acute decompensated heart failure”. Boolean operators (AND/OR) were used to refine the search results. Filters were applied to include studies published in English between 2019 and 2024. Additionally, reference lists of pertinent reviews were manually screened to identify any additional relevant studies. Duplicates were removed using EndNote X9 (Clarivate Plc., London, England) duplicate removal function.Eligibility criteriaRandomized controlled trials (RCTs) focusing on adult patients (>18 years old) with AHF who received dapagliflozin or empagliflozin within the first five days of hospitalization were included. We excluded studies that employed other SGLT2i or non-pharmacological interventions, were not original RCTs (e.g., observational studies, case reports, or reviews), enrolled pediatric populations, or did not involve patients with AHF, initiated dapagliflozin or empagliflozin reatment later than five days post-admission, failed to report our prespecified outcomes, or were not published in English.Study selection and data extractionThree investigators (SSI, ERY, and GT) independently screened the titles and abstracts of retrieved studies for eligibility. Full-text articles were obtained for studies that met the inclusion criteria or when eligibility was uncertain from the abstract. Any discrepancies during the screening process were resolved through discussion with senior authors (AEPS, IP, and VB). Data were extracted using a standardized form and included study characteristics (year of publication, study design, sample size), participant demographics, and clinically relevant outcomes such as all-cause mortality, HF-related events (e.g., worsening HF, rehospitalization), AEs, and other pertinent clinical endpoints.Risk of bias assessmentThe risk of bias for each included study was independently evaluated by three investigators (SSI, ERY, and GT) using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 (RoB 2) tool [10]. This instrument assesses five domains: bias arising from the randomization process, bias due to deviations from intended interventions, bias due to missing outcome data, bias in the measurement of outcomes, and bias in the selection of reported results. Each domain has a low risk of bias, some concerns, or a high risk of bias. A study was considered low risk if all domains were judged to be low risk. If it had at least one domain with some concerns and none at high risk, it was judged as having some concerns. If any domain was rated high risk or if there were multiple domains with some concerns that reduced confidence in the outcome, the study was considered high risk. Only studies classified as low risk or some concerns were included in the analysis. Any discrepancies were resolved through discussion with the senior investigators (AEPS, IP, and VB).Data synthesis and statistical analysisStatistical analyses were performed using review manager (RevMan) version 5.4 (Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen, Denmark). For dichotomous outcomes, a pooled risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated using the Mantel-Haenszel method. For continuous outcomes, pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% CIs were calculated using the inverse variance method. A random-effects model was employed to account for potential heterogeneity among studies. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic, with values above 50% or a Chi-squared p < 0.10 indicating substantial heterogeneity. In cases of significant heterogeneity, subgroup analyses were conducted to explore potential sources.Sensitivity analysis and quality of evidenceSensitivity analyses were conducted by removing studies classified as high risk of bias, defined as having at least one domain rated high risk or multiple domains rated as some concerns according to the RoB 2 tool, to evaluate the stability of the pooled results. The certainty of evidence for each outcome was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework (high, moderate, low, or very low), briefly considering factors such as risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias [11].ResultsStudy selectionA total of 473 records were identified through database searches, and one additional record was found via manual hand-searching, yielding 474 records for initial consideration. After the removal of 79 duplicates, 395 titles and abstracts were screened. Of these, 371 studies were excluded for being irrelevant to the research question. The full texts of the remaining 24 articles were assessed for eligibility. Fifteen studies were excluded at this stage: ten for evaluating different outcomes, four for containing irrelevant data, and one for different group intervention. Ultimately, nine RCTs met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. The study selection process is outlined in the PRISMA flow diagram (Figure 1).\nFigure 1.PRISMA flow diagram depicting study selection.Risk of bias assessmentThe risk of bias for each included study was evaluated using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool (Figure 2). Overall, four studies were rated as having some concerns regarding the risk of bias across the five assessed domains. Ibrahim et al. [12] exhibited concerns due to unclear blinding of participants and allocation concealment in Domains 1 and 2. Charaya et al. [13,14] raised concerns due to the lack of blinding of participants and personnel in Domain 2. Similarly, Cox et al. [15] was assessed with concerns in Domain 2 because neither participants nor personnel were blinded to treatment assignments.\nFigure 2.Risk of bias assessment using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool (RoB 2).The nine included studies were all RCTs published between 2020 and 2024 (Table 1). The total sample size comprised 1,417 patients with AHF. Of these, 28.44% received early dapagliflozin, 21.52% received early empagliflozin, and the remaining patients received a placebo. Among the patients, 70.94% had ADHF, while 29.06% were presented with de novo HF. Approximately 49.36% of the patients had comorbid diabetes. Detailed baseline characteristics, including patient demographics and clinical features, are presented in Table 1.\nTable 1.Results of fractionation of vacuum liquid chromatography of ethanol extract of Caulerpa racemosa (EECR) and Caulerpa lentillifera (EECL)StudyYearGroupsnAge (mean±SD, years)Male (%)History of heart failure (%)Diabetes (%)Initiation of treatmentDuration of hospital Follow-up stay (days) (days)Damman et al.

All analyses showed early dapagliflozin and empagliflozin did not significantly affect AEs (Figure 10), acute kidney injury (AKI) (Figure 11), symptomatic hypertension (Figure 12), hypoglycemia (Figure 13), and urinary tract infection (UTI) (Figure 14). However, empagliflozin showed a significant decrease in the risk of serious AEs compared to control (RR: 0.73; 95%CI: 0.59–0.90; p = 0.004), with no significant heterogeneity (I2 = 0%) (Figure 15). According to the GRADE approach, most AEs outcomes were classified as having a moderate degree of certainty, while serious AEs were classified as having high degree of certainty.\nFigure 10.Forest plot showing the effects of early initiation of dapagliflozin and empagliflozin on adverse events among acute heart failure (AHF) patients.\nFigure 11.Forest plot showing the effects of early initiation of dapagliflozin and empagliflozin on acute kidney injury among acute heart failure (AHF) patients.\nFigure 12.Forest plot showing the effects of early initiation of dapagliflozin and empagliflozin on symptomatic hypotension among acute heart failure (AHF) patients.\nFigure 13.Forest plot showing the effects of early initiation of dapagliflozin and empagliflozin on hypoglycemia among acute heart failure (AHF) patients.\nFigure 14.Forest plot showing the effects of early initiation of dapagliflozin and empagliflozin on urinary tract infection among acute heart failure (AHF) patients.\nFigure 15.Forest plot showing the effects of early initiation of dapagliflozin and empagliflozin on serious adverse events among acute heart failure (AHF) patients.DiscussionThis systematic review and meta-analysis of nine RCTs involving 1,417 patients with AHF demonstrated that initiating SGLT2i—specifically dapagliflozin and empagliflozin—within five days of hospital admission significantly reduced in-hospital all-cause mortality by 42% and in–hospital worsening HF by 39%. Additionally, SGLT2i use was associated with a 27% reduction in serious AEs risk. No significant differences were observed in other outcomes, including specific AEs such as AKI, hepatic injury, symptomatic hypotension, hypoglycemia, UTIs, and diabetic ketoacidosis. The analysis showed homogeneity across studies, with no significant differences between the effects of dapagliflozin and empagliflozin.Our findings on mortality align with previous studies [21,22], which reported that early initiation of SGLT2i can prevent significant deterioration in cardiac function. The hemodynamic stability provided by SGLT2i, resulting from their natriuretic effects, contributes to the prevention of functional decline in HF patients and reduces the need for intensified diuretic therapy. This benefit is particularly notable with prolonged treatment, highlighting the efficacy of SGLT2i in stabilizing patients with AHF.The significant reduction in in-hospital worsening HF corroborates previous studies [22,23], which attributed these benefits to favorable changes in natriuretic peptide concentrations, leading to decreased left ventricular mass and attenuation of cardiac remodeling. These physiological effects may contribute to the improved clinical outcomes observed with early SGLT2i initiation in AHF patients.Contrastingly, some studies reported differing results regarding rehospitalization and length of hospital stay. Other studies [24,25] supported the beneficial effects of early dapagliflozin on reducing rehospitalization risk, particularly in patients with acute de novo HF. However, another study indicated that SGLT2i reduces rehospitalization risk compared to non-SGLT2i treatments. Variations in study populations, definitions of HF subtypes, and trial designs may explain these discrepancies. Our findings did not significantly impact the length of hospital stay, differing from one previous study [25], which reported a shorter hospital stay with early dapagliflozin initiation.The lack of significant influence of SGLT2i on diuretic response, measured by weight loss, contrasts with previous studies [26,27], which suggested that the benefits of SGLT2i may vary depending on body mass index (BMI). One previous study [27] observed a consistent weight loss effect with empagliflozin across all BMI categories. Discrepancies may result from variations in patient characteristics, BMI distributions, and the duration of follow-up in different studies.Our findings that SGLT2i did not significantly affect discharged serum sodium levels are consistent with a previous study [28], which observed that early SGLT2i treatment leads to an initial reduction in sodium concentration due to osmotic and natriuretic diuresis. This is followed by compensatory mechanisms, such as increased vasopressin secretion and reduced free-water clearance, ultimately stabilizing serum sodium levels at discharge.Regarding safety outcomes, we did not observe significant differences in the incidence of specific AEs, which aligns with previous studies [29,30], suggesting that early SGLT2i initiation is generally safe in AHF patients. However, the significant reduction in serious AEs with empagliflozin observed in our study corroborates findings reported in previous research [22]. Although we did not find a significant increase in AKI among patients treated with SGLT2i, some studies have reported transient changes in renal function parameters, indicating that further investigation is warranted to elucidate the long-term implications on renal function in AHF patients.Our analysis did not show a significant increase in UTIs or hypoglycemia, which is consistent with previous studies [30,31]. The glycemic effects of empagliflozin were observed primarily in patients with T2DM, with minimal impact on those with normoglycemia or prediabetes, as reported in previous research [27] which aligns with the mechanism of SGLT2i targeting hyperglycemia.This study has several limitations that should be considered. First, the included trials varied in their designs, patient populations, and outcome definitions, which may contribute to heterogeneity despite statistical homogeneity. Second, the relatively short follow-up periods may not capture long-term outcomes and AEs associated with SGLT2i use. Third, the majority of patients had comorbid T2DM, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to non-diabetic AHF populations. Additionally, the analysis did not fully account for the potential influences of concomitant medications and variations in standard HF therapies.ConclusionEarly initiation of dapagliflozin and empagliflozin in patients with AHF offers significant benefits in reducing in-hospital mortality and worsening HF, without increasing the risk of AEs. These findings support their use as a potential therapeutic strategy in this population, particularly due to their safety profile and efficacy in preventing serious AEs. However, the lack of impact on rehospitalization, length of stay, and other secondary outcomes indicates that further research is warranted to evaluate these aspects comprehensively."}

{"PMCID": "11754262", "title": "The efficacy and safety of indobufen in patients with ischemic cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases: systematic review and meta-analysis", "abstract": "ObjectiveThis meta-analysis aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of indobufen in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, and thromboembolic disorders. The primary focus is on the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), thrombosis, bleeding events, and adverse reactions. The results are intended to provide a reference for the clinical application of indobufen and suggest directions for further large-scale, multi-center, prospective studies.MethodsThis review follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library databases to identify all relevant studies on indobufen. Twelve trials, all randomized controlled trials (RCTs), met the inclusion criteria. The results were presented as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), and meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 and Stata 18.0 software.ResultsThe meta-analysis included 12 randomized controlled trials. Regarding safety, indobufen showed superior clinical outcomes compared to other antiplatelet agents regarding bleeding events, gastrointestinal adverse reactions, and overall adverse reactions, with these differences being more pronounced in cardiovascular diseases. However, the effects of both treatments on efficacy outcomes, including MACE, myocardial infarction, angina, mortality, and thrombotic events, were similar. For stroke events, particularly in patients with cerebrovascular diseases, the use of indobufen was associated with some risk.ConclusionIndobufen is associated with a lower risk of adverse reactions and bleeding, making it a viable option for patients at risk of bleeding or adverse effects, particularly in those with cardiovascular diseases. However, compared to anticoagulants such as aspirin and clopidogrel, indobufen has a shorter history of use, and its evidence base is relatively limited, highlighting the need for further research. Currently, indobufen is widely used in secondary cardiovascular and cerebrovascular prevention and provides some guidance for antiplatelet therapy in patients with gastrointestinal discomfort or bleeding risk. However, due to the potential risks in MACE, stroke, and other events, further clinical trials are needed to assess the clinical applicability of indobufen.Systematic Review Registrationhttps://www.crd.york.ac.uk/, identifier (CRD42024587938).", "body": "1IntroductionIndobufen, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), has demonstrated significant antiplatelet aggregation effects, making it widely used to prevent and treat cardiovascular diseases. Cardiovascular diseases, one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide, are steadily increasing in prevalence. According to statistics from the World Health Organization (WHO), ischemic heart disease and stroke rank first among the top ten causes of death worldwide. Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases cause approximately 14 million deaths annually, accounting for 23% of the total global mortality (1). With the aging population and lifestyle changes, the incidence of cardiovascular diseases is on the rise, highlighting the critical need for effective antithrombotic and antiplatelet therapies.The formation of intravascular thrombosis is the primary cause of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (2). Arterial thrombosis primarily comprises platelets and forms at sites of atherosclerotic vascular injury under increased shear stress and disturbed blood flow (3). Antiplatelet drugs, which reduce thrombosis by inhibiting platelet aggregation, play a key role in significantly reducing the incidence of cardiovascular events and are an essential therapeutic approach for treating cardiovascular diseases. Indobufen exerts its antiplatelet effects by inhibiting cyclooxygenase activity (COX-1 and COX-2), thereby reducing the synthesis of platelet aggregation-promoting substances (4). In recent years, there have been an increasing number of studies assessing the effectiveness and safety of indobufen in treating cardiovascular conditions. However, results from various studies have been inconsistent; some demonstrate significant efficacy in preventing cardiovascular events (5), while others fail to confirm its superiority (6). Hence, a systematic evaluation of indobufen's role in cardiovascular disease treatment is crucial.This study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of indobufen in treating cardiovascular diseases through a systematic review and meta-analysis systematic review of existing literature, thus exploring its potential clinical value. This provides a basis for further clinical research and offers valuable guidance for treating patients with cardiovascular diseases.2MethodsAccording to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses), the protocol for this meta-analysis was registered on PROSPERO (Registration No: CRD42024587938) (7).2.1Inclusion criteriaStudy Population: Adult patients with cardiovascular or thromboembolic diseases. Intervention: With no dosage or treatment duration restrictions, Indobufen can be used as a single treatment or in combination with other standard treatments. Control: A placebo or another positive control drug, alone or in combination with other standard treatments, without restrictions on dosage or duration. Outcome Measures: Efficacy outcomes including MACE (major adverse cardiovascular events), stroke, myocardial infarction, thrombosis, and mortality, and safety outcomes such as adverse reactions and bleeding. Study Design: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs).2.2Exclusion criteriaStudies such as conference abstracts, reviews, animal experiments, or republished research; studies where the treatment group does not use indobufen; and studies lacking a control group will be excluded.2.3Search strategyOne reviewer conducted a computer-based search of the PubMed, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases using the keywords “indobufen”, “cardiovascular diseases” ,“cerebrovascular diseases”, “thromboembolic diseases”, and “randomized controlled trials”. The search strategy combined both MeSH terms and free-text terms. The search covered the period from establishing each database until September 2, 2024 (See the Supplementary Material for details).2.4Study selectionTwo reviewers independently screened the literature based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The full texts were downloaded and thoroughly reviewed for studies meeting the criteria, followed by a second screening and cross-checking. Data were then independently extracted by the two reviewers according to a pre-designed data extraction form, including the essential characteristics of the included studies and their results. Based on the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, the two reviewers independently assessed the methodological quality of the included studies.2.5Assessment of risk of bias and quality of evidenceBased on Cochrane risk-of-bias criteria, two reviewers (XL and CL) independently assessed the quality of all included trials. Stata was used to calculate the risk of bias.2.6Data analysisAnalyses were conducted using Review Manager 5.3 and Stata 18.0 software. A heterogeneity test was performed on the data before the meta-analysis. If the studies had no significant heterogeneity (P > 0.05 and I2 < 50%), a fixed-effect model was used to weigh and combine the effect sizes. If heterogeneity was present (P < 0.05 and I2 > 50%), studies with significant heterogeneity were excluded from meeting the heterogeneity threshold, after which a fixed-effect model was used to weigh and combine the effect sizes. The results were expressed as relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Subgroup analysis was conducted based on the disease type, study country or region, study type, and drug type. Publication bias was assessed using Egger's test, Begg's test, and funnel plot analysis (P > 0.05 indicates no publication bias; confidence level: Egger's test > Begg's test > funnel plot). A P-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Additionally, sensitivity analysis was performed using the “metaninf” tool in Stata software.3ResultsAfter screening the databases, 168 studies were initially identified. After 66 duplicate studies were removed, 37 irrelevant studies were excluded based on their titles and abstracts. Additionally, 37 articles were excluded because they were reviews or meta-analyses. The full texts of 28 articles were further reviewed, resulting in the exclusion of 16 articles. Among these, 3 trials lacked results, 4 were conference abstracts, and 9 studies had unavailable full texts, making data extraction impossible. Ultimately, 12 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in this meta-analysis. A brief description of the literature screening process is shown in Figure 1, while a summary of the key characteristics of the included studies is provided in Table 1.Figure 1Literature search and screening flow diagram.Table 1Characteristics of included studies.StudyCountryParticipantsTreatmentDesignAgeSex(F/M)No. of participantsOutcomesIndobufenOthersIndobufenOthersIndobufenOthersIndobufenOthersBarilla et al.

(F) Forest plot of mortality events.3.3StrokeSix studies reported stroke events (5, 6, 9, 11, 14, 17). The combined results showed a significant difference in stroke event rates between the indobufen and other treatment groups (RR: 1.17, 95% CI: 1.00–1.36, I2 = 45%, P = 0.049; Figure 3B).3.4Myocardial infarctionSeven studies reported myocardial infarction events (5, 6, 8–11, 14). The combined results showed no significant difference in the incidence of myocardial infarction between the indobufen group and other treatment groups (RR: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.49–1.38, I2 = 0%, P = 0.45; Figure 3C).3.5Recurrence of angina pectorisTwo studies reported recurrent angina events (10, 16). The combined results showed no significant difference in the incidence of recurrent angina between the indobufen group and other treatment groups (RR: 0.25, 95% CI: 0.03–2.21, I2 = 12%, P = 0.21; Figure 3D).3.6Thrombotic eventsSix studies reported thrombotic events (8, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17). After heterogeneity testing (I2 = 58.5%, Q test P = 0.03), the results indicated statistical heterogeneity between the included studies. After excluding the study by Belcaro et al. (12), which had a significant impact on heterogeneity, the combined results showed no significant difference in the incidence of thrombotic events between the indobufen group and other treatment groups (RR: 1.04, 95% CI: 0.82–1.33, I2 = 0%, P = 0.74; Figure 3E).3.7DeathSeven studies reported mortality events (5, 6, 9, 11, 14–16). The combined results showed no significant difference in the incidence of mortality between the indobufen group and other treatment groups (RR: 1.03, 95% CI: 0.82–1.29, I2 = 28%, P = 0.80; Figure 3F).3.8Bleeding eventsTen studies reported bleeding events (5, 6, 8–10, 13–17). One study was excluded due to a lack of event occurrence (8). Heterogeneity testing showed that the study by Morocutti et al. (14) had a significant impact on heterogeneity (I2 = 62%, Q test P = 0.008). After excluding this study, the combined results showed a significant difference in bleeding event rates between the indobufen group and other treatment groups (RR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.63–0.94, I2 = 39%, P = 0.01; Figure 4A).Figure 4Forest plots of indobufen treatment safety evaluations.

One study was excluded due to a lack of event occurrence (12). Heterogeneity testing (I2 = 55.6%, Q test P = 0.05) indicated statistical heterogeneity. After excluding the study by Bergamasco et al. (9), the combined results showed a significant difference in the overall adverse reaction rates between the indobufen group and other treatment groups (RR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.61–0.91, I2 = 33%, P = 0.004; Figure 4B).3.10Total adverse reaction eventsEight studies reported total adverse reaction events (6, 8–11, 13, 14, 16), which included gastrointestinal adverse reactions, dizziness, rash, allergic reactions, and anemia. One study was excluded due to a lack of event occurrence (7). Heterogeneity testing (I2 = 67%, Q test P = 0.006) indicated statistical heterogeneity. After excluding the study by Yuesong Pan et al. (6), the combined results showed a significant difference in the total adverse reaction rates between the indobufen group and other treatment groups (RR: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.69–0.90, I2 = 42%, P = 0.0004; Figure 4C).3.11Subgroup analysis3.11.1Subgroup analysis of efficacy evaluationThe subgroup analysis for cerebrovascular diseases indicated a significant difference in stroke event rates between the indobufen and other treatment groups (RR: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.04–1.43, I2 = 23%, P = 0.02). No meaningful results were found in the other subgroup analyses (Supplementary Tables S1–S4).3.11.2Subgroup analysis of safety evaluationIn the subgroup analysis of cardiovascular diseases, significant differences were found in the bleeding events (RR: 0.62, 95% CI: 0.47–0.83, I2 = 0%, P = 0.001), gastrointestinal adverse reactions (RR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.60–0.90, I2 = 45%, P = 0.002), and total adverse reaction events (RR: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.67–0.88, I2 = 43%, P = 0.0001) between the indobufen group and other treatment groups. Additionally, in the subgroup analysis based on the treatment drug, indobufen showed a more favorable effect compared to aspirin and clopidogrel for bleeding events and gastrointestinal adverse reactions (RR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.61–0.92, I2 = 41%, P = 0.0006; RR: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.59–0.88, I2 = 1%, P = 0.001). No meaningful results were found in the other subgroup analyses (Supplementary Tables S1–S4).3.12Sensitivity analysisHeterogeneity tests were conducted when synthesizing effect sizes for each group. If the heterogeneity test indicated statistical significance, studies that contributed substantially to the heterogeneity were excluded. In the final pooled results, heterogeneity was within acceptable limits. Sensitivity analyses were also performed, and the results remained stable (Supplementary Figures S1–S9).3.13Publication biasPublication bias was tested for each outcome by performing Egger's test, Begg's test, and funnel plot analysis (Supplementary Figures S10–S18). Both Egger's and Begg's tests showed P > 0.05, indicating no significant publication bias for the studies included in the analysis of each outcome.4DiscussionBased on meta-analysis, this study systematically evaluated the efficacy and safety of indobufen in treating cardiovascular diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, and thromboembolic diseases. Through this meta-analysis, we confirmed that indobufen demonstrates better clinical outcomes than other antiplatelet drugs in safety endpoints, including bleeding, gastrointestinal, and overall adverse reactions. Specifically, subgroup analyses of monotherapy or combination therapy with aspirin or clopidogrel, as well as cardiovascular disease subgroup analysis, revealed that indobufen had a significant advantage in bleeding events and gastrointestinal adverse reactions, which may be attributed to the reversible antiplatelet effect of indobufen. Regarding efficacy, no significant clinical superiority was observed for indobufen in MACE, myocardial infarction, angina, thrombosis, and mortality events compared to other antiplatelet therapies. However, in the case of stroke events, especially among cerebrovascular disease patients, indobufen demonstrated some risks.Additionally, heterogeneity issues were of considerable concern in this study. Although studies with significant heterogeneity were excluded in the combined analysis, factors such as study design differences, participants' baseline characteristics, and drug dosages may still influence the results. The subgroup analyses in this study showed that heterogeneity in thrombotic events, gastrointestinal adverse reactions, and total adverse reaction outcomes were primarily caused by inconsistent disease types among the included studies. No significant heterogeneity was found in the outcomes mentioned above after performing subgroup analyses based on different disease types (Supplementary Figures S19–S22). For bleeding events, heterogeneity caused by the study by Morocutti et al. (14) and publication bias visible in the funnel plot were further explored. We speculated that the close monitoring of patients in this study during follow-up may have kept the relevant indicators within optimal ranges, which could explain why the original data from this study may not reflect the most realistic research situation compared to other studies.Although no other meaningful results could be obtained in this study apart from the findings mentioned above, several interesting issues were observed. In cerebrovascular diseases, indobufen treatment may lead to higher risks of thrombosis and gastrointestinal adverse reactions. Further analysis of the included studies suggests that the high risk could be attributed to the few included studies (only two), which may have led to biased results and cannot be generalized. Furthermore, in subgroup analyses of cerebrovascular diseases and Asian patients, indobufen exhibited a higher risk in MACE events and stroke events, which is consistent with the conclusions from the study by Morocutti et al. (14). However, no statistical differences were found between the treatment groups after adjusting for prognostic factors. Multivariable analysis revealed that these factors were female sex, history of stroke, and myocardial infarction at admission (14). It is also well-known that antiplatelet drugs may show low responsiveness in certain diseases or populations due to metabolic pathways or genetic effects, such as the CYP2C19 enzyme for clopidogrel metabolism and the COX-1 gene and P2Y12 gene polymorphisms for aspirin metabolism (19–23). Due to variations in drug dosages, potential drug synergistic effects, the polymorphisms of the genes mentioned above, and the larger weight of findings from studies with large sample sizes, the higher risk associated with indobufen may have been influenced.Our meta-analysis confirmed that indobufen has certain advantages for patients with gastrointestinal dysfunction or aspirin intolerance in cardiovascular diseases, consistent with expert consensus in clinical guidelines (19). Previous clinical studies, such as OPTION (indobufen or aspirin with clopidogrel for coronary artery drug-eluting stent implantation) and INSURE (indobufen vs. aspirin in acute ischemic stroke), large multi-center clinical trials comparing indobufen and aspirin, reported similar results to our meta-analysis. Indobufen demonstrated advantages in bleeding outcomes compared to other antiplatelet drugs, but for preventing recurrence in cerebrovascular diseases, especially in stroke patients, indobufen was not superior to aspirin. Moreover, a series of previous systematic reviews evaluating the efficacy and safety of indobufen have also pointed out that its effectiveness is significantly lower than other antiplatelet therapies in patients with gastrointestinal discomfort or those at risk of bleeding (24–26).This meta-analysis comprehensively analyzed the efficacy and safety of indobufen in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, as well as thromboembolic diseases, and conducted subgroup analyses with possible explanations for significant results. However, due to differences in study designs, such as varied inclusion and exclusion criteria, baseline characteristics of patient populations, and differences in the diseases studied [e.g., coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and non-rheumatic atrial fibrillation (AF)], as well as time spans between studies (from 1993 to 2024). Inconsistent definitions of outcome assessment, these factors could have influenced the final results of the meta-analysis. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that indobufen shows advantages compared to other antiplatelet drugs in safety outcomes.5LimitationSeveral limitations remain in this study. Firstly, the open-label design of some randomized trials may potentially influence the outcomes and introduce bias into the results. Additionally, Different studies used various metrics to assess treatment efficacy, and the statistical forms of these metrics were inconsistent across studies, such as the thromboxane B2 (TXB2) levels in plasma and urine, making it difficult to compare the outcomes of these studies. Therefore, the research focuses only on safety indicators, such as bleeding events and adverse reactions, as well as efficacy indicators, such as cardiovascular events and stroke.Third, the included studies had inconsistent dosing regimens and insufficient studies with the same dosing protocols. This inconsistency in dosing regimens limits the interpretation of differences between the two groups in the final pooled analysis and introduces bias. In particular, the limited number of studies related to thromboembolic diseases included in this research made it difficult to evaluate the efficacy and safety of indobufen in treating thromboembolic diseases. Fourth, the studies from Asian countries included in this research were limited to China. While these studies provide valuable references for indobufen use in China and other Asian countries, future research should involve more countries and ethnic groups to obtain better results.6ConclusionThere are several antiplatelet drugs currently available in clinical practice, including aspirin, clopidogrel, and warfarin. Indobufen, as a secondary medication for preventing cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, exhibits high selectivity and reversible binding to its receptor (27), offering certain advantages over other anticoagulants. However, compared to other anticoagulants, indobufen is used for a shorter duration, and there are fewer large-scale clinical studies, which limits the strength of the available evidence. Additionally, the increased risk of MACE and stroke observed in the indobufen group in this study suggests that, in specific conditions such as cerebrovascular diseases, these risks may be more pronounced. In conclusion, indobufen may be a suitable choice for certain populations. Its low association with bleeding events and adverse reactions provides some guidance for clinical antiplatelet therapy in patients at potential risk of bleeding or adverse reactions. Nevertheless, compared to widely recognized antiplatelet drugs like aspirin and clopidogrel, indobufen still shows certain limitations in clinical efficacy. Therefore, using indobufen should be based on carefully assessing its effectiveness and safety with individualized treatment decisions. Further research focusing on different disease types and populations will be crucial for better defining the indications and scope of use for indobufen in future clinical practice."}
{"PMCID": "12184231", "title": "High Burden and Trend in Nonadherence to Blood Pressure‐Lowering Medications: Meta‐Analysis of Data From Over 34 000 Adults With Hypertension in Sub‐Saharan Africa", "abstract": "BackgroundNonadherence to blood pressure (BP)‐lowering medication is a strong predictor of poor BP control. Sub‐Saharan Africa has extremely low BP control rates (~10%), but it is unclear what the burden of medication nonadherence among Africans with hypertension is. This systematic review estimated the prevalence and determinants of nonadherence to BP‐lowering medications in Sub‐Saharan Africa.Methods and ResultsMultiple databases were searched from inception to December 6, 2023. Two reviewers performed independent screening, extraction, and quality assessment of studies. We pooled the prevalence estimates using random effects meta‐analyses and summarized the determinants using a narrative synthesis. From the 1307 records identified, we included 95 studies published between 1995 and 2023. The overall prevalence of nonadherence to BP‐lowering medication among 34 102 people treated for hypertension in 27 countries was 43.9% (95% CI, 39.2–48.6). There was no change in the prevalence of nonadherence over time. Nonadherence varied by measurement method and by median age (39.4%, ≥57 years versus 47.9%, <57 years). Socioeconomic and patient‐related factors were the most frequent factors influencing adherence. Active patient participation in management, accurate perceptions, and knowledge of hypertension and its treatment predicted good medication adherence, whereas high pill burden, medication cost, side effects, and comorbidities predicted poor adherence.ConclusionsTwo out of every 5 people are nonadherent to their BP treatment. With the African population projected to increase from 1.4 to ~2.5 billion by 2050, targeted strategies are urgently needed to optimize medication adherence in people with hypertension in Sub‐Saharan Africa.", "body": "Nonstandard Abbreviations and AcronymsSSASub‐Saharan Africa\nClinical PerspectiveWhat Is New?\nThe burden of nonadherence to blood pressure (BP)‐lowering medication in people with hypertension in Sub‐Saharan Africa is high (43.9%), and for the first time, this study demonstrates that the trend has remained unchanged over nearly 3 decades.\nWhat Are the Clinical Implications?\nWith rapid population growth, increasing prevalence of hypertension and nonadherence to BP‐lowering medication, we can expect health systems in Sub‐Saharan Africa to be overwhelmed with patients presenting complications of high BP like stroke, heart attacks, and kidney disease.Clinicians and other stakeholders involved in BP control in Sub‐Saharan Africa need to focus on improving patient awareness of hypertension and its treatment and facilitate active patient participation in their management to optimize adherence and BP control.\n\nHypertension is the leading risk factor for disease burden globally, affecting nearly 1.3 billion adults\n1\n and contributing to over 10.8 million deaths each year.\n2\n The prevalence of hypertension in Sub‐Saharan (SSA) is high, affecting about 1 in 3 adults and 1 in 2 people aged 50 years and over.\n3\n, \n4\n, \n5\n, \n6\n In SSA, over half of the women and two thirds of the men with hypertension remain undiagnosed. This high burden of hypertension contrasts with very low treatment and control rates. A recent global analysis found that only 22% to 29% of adults diagnosed with hypertension in SSA are treated; of these, only 9% of men and 13% of women have their blood pressure (BP) controlled.\n1\n Pharmacotherapy and lifestyle modification are the mainstay of BP control to prevent vascular complications including stroke, ischemic heart disease, chronic kidney disease, and dementia.\n3\n\nThe World Health Organization defines adherence as the extent to which an individual's behavior—taking medication, following a diet, or executing lifestyle changes—corresponds with agreed recommendations from a health care provider.\n7\n Nonadherence to medication has been identified as a major predictor of poorly controlled hypertension. Compared with people who are adherent to BP‐lowering medication, those who are nonadherent are twice as likely to have suboptimal BP control and to develop complications of hypertension.\n8\n Understanding the extent of nonadherence and determinants is critical to the development of appropriate interventions to prevent the health and economic consequences for affected people and health systems. Prior reviews exploring adherence to BP‐lowering medication have been limited by either narrow inclusion time periods,\n9\n, \n10\n restricted to 1 adherence measurement method,\n9\n, \n11\n lacked quality appraisal of the evidence,\n9\n did not assess determinants of nonadherence,\n12\n or had a broad geographical focus with limited representation of SSA.\n8\n, \n13\n\nGiven the high burden of hypertension, low rates of BP control in SSA, and the existing evidence gaps, this systematic review and meta‐analysis sought to answer the following questions: (1) What is the contemporary burden of nonadherence to BP‐lowering medication among people with hypertension in SSA, and has it changed over time? and (2) What are the determinants of (non‐)adherence to BP‐lowering medication in SSA?METHODSAll data underpinning this review are provided in the main article and supplementary files.Search Strategy and Selection CriteriaThe review protocol is registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews database (CRD42017079838) and published.\n14\n This review was reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐analysis (2020) guidelines.\n15\n Institutional review board approval was not required for this article as it is a review and synthesis of already published primary research. All supporting data are available within the article and supplementary material. MEDLINE via Ovid, SCOPUS, Web of Science, African Journals Online databases and gray literature (via Google Scholar) were searched to identify all relevant articles from the inception of databases until December 6, 2023. Search terms related to BP‐lowering medication and adherence were combined with relevant Boolean operators and a validated African search filter\n16\n to improve the sensitivity and precision of the search. No language restrictions were applied. See Tables S1 through S6 for the detailed search strategies and study inclusion.We included primary observational studies reporting the prevalence of or factors associated with (non‐)adherence to BP‐lowering medication among adults with hypertension residing in SSA. Studies were excluded if they were conducted out of SSA, selected participants based on their medication adherence status, had incomplete data or lacked relevant data to compute the prevalence of nonadherence, and those with <30 participants. In addition, letters to the editor, commentaries, reports without primary data, or explicit descriptions of the methods were excluded. Duplicate studies based on the same data were excluded and only the most comprehensive report was retained.Screening and Data ExtractionFollowing the database search, all records were uploaded to the Rayyan systematic review software\n17\n and duplicates were removed. Two investigators (L.N.A. and F.N.T.) independently screened titles and abstracts. Full texts of potentially eligible studies were assessed for final inclusion (L.N.A. and V.N.A.), and data were independently extracted by 3 pairs of reviewers (LNA, VNA, NTF, MAN, CAN and CN). We resolved any disagreements by consensus discussion. The following data were extracted from individual studies: the last name of the first author and year of publication, year(s) of recruitment, the country, study design, study setting (rural versus urban) and study type (community‐based versus hospital‐based), method or tool used to define medication adherence, approach to data collection (interview‐administered versus self‐administered), sample size, total number of patients nonadherent to BP‐lowering medication, mean or median age, and the male proportion. Only baseline data were extracted for cohort studies. For multinational studies, the combined data were extracted and, where possible, the disaggregated (country‐specific) data. For studies reporting on factors associated with medication adherence, we extracted measures of association and CIs for variables based on multivariable regression analyses.Risk of Bias Assessment and Certainty of the EvidenceThe risk of bias tool developed by Hoy et al.\n18\n was used to evaluate the methodological quality of prevalence studies. The tool assesses selection/sampling methods, response rate, outcome measurement, and validity of reporting. The Newcastle‐Ottawa Scale was used to assess cohort studies.\n19\n The Newcastle‐Ottawa Scale includes 8 items spread across 3 domains: selection of participants, comparability, and outcome assessment. Two reviewers (L.N.A. and C.A.N.) independently assessed the quality of studies, and any disagreements were resolved by consensus.The overall quality of the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach.\n20\n In the absence of specific guidance for systematic reviews of prevalence estimates, we followed the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework proposed for assessing confidence in incidence estimates from prognostic studies.\n21\n\nStatistical AnalysisA random effects meta‐analysis using the DerSimonian‐Laird method was used to estimate the pooled prevalence of nonadherence to BP‐lowering medication. Given the challenges with interpretation and limitations of transformation techniques,\n22\n, \n23\n we used raw proportions for this meta‐analysis.\n23\n Heterogeneity was assessed using the weighted SD of the study‐specific proportions as well as the Cochran's Q test and the I2 statistic.\n24\n In addition, prediction intervals for the pooled prevalence were estimated to depict the degree of uncertainty in the meta‐analysis. Subgroup analyses were conducted to investigate potential sources of heterogeneity. The Q test based on the analysis of variance was used to compare between subgroups. For studies reporting high, medium, and low adherence levels, as opposed to adherent versus nonadherent, nonadherence was defined as having low adherence levels in the main analysis. Sensitivity analyses was performed reclassifying individuals with medium adherence levels as nonadherent. Additionally, the prevalence of nonadherence was estimated using only studies with a low risk of bias. Influence analysis was used to investigate the impact of individual studies on the pooled estimate. To determine if the burden of nonadherence to BP‐lowering medication has changed over time, we conducted a meta‐regression analysis of prevalence estimates by publication years using a Poisson model with sample size as an offset and robust SEs and report the estimated relative rates.Small study effects were examined using the Doi plot and the Luis‐Furuya Kanamori index. A Luis‐Furuya Kanamori index of zero represents complete symmetry in the Doi plot. Any indices between −1 and +1 represent plot symmetry, and any values beyond ±1 are consistent with plot asymmetry. Compared with the traditional funnel plot and Egger's regression test, these measures have been shown to have better visual representation of asymmetry and diagnostic accuracy in detecting small study effects.\n25\n, \n26\n All statistical analyses were conducted in R Studio (R version 4.2.3) using the ‘meta’ and ‘metasens’ packages.RESULTSOverview of Included StudiesThe search identified 1315 records. After removing duplicates and screening titles and abstracts, we assessed 158 full texts for eligibility. We included 95 studies comprising 34 102 adults with hypertension in the systematic review and meta‐analysis (Figure 1). There were 2 multicountry studies, one with 12 countries\n27\n and the other with 2 countries.\n28\n Overall, most of the studies were conducted in Western SSA countries (n=50, 47.2%), including Nigeria (n=29), Ghana (n=11), Côte d'Ivoire (n=4), Togo (n=2), and Benin, Guinea, Mauritania, Senegal with 1 study each. The second most represented region was Eastern SSA (n=34, 32.1%), including Ethiopia (n=23), Kenya (n=3), Eritrea and Tanzania with 2 studies each, and Malawi, Mozambique, Seychelles, and Uganda with 1 study each. Next was Southern SSA (n=13, 12.3%), with studies conducted in South Africa (n=5), Zimbabwe (n=3), Namibia (n=2) and 1 each in Botswana, Lesotho, and Zambia. Finally, studies from Central SSA (n=9, 8.5%) included Cameroon (n=4), the Democratic Republic of Congo (n=2), Congo (n=2), and Gabon (n=1).Figure 1Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses flow diagram depicting the selection of studies for inclusion in the review.AJOL indicates African Journals Online.The most frequently used tool to measure adherence was the 8‐item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (n=25, 26.3%).\n27\n, \n28\n, \n29\n, \n30\n, \n31\n, \n32\n, \n33\n, \n34\n, \n35\n, \n36\n, \n37\n, \n38\n, \n39\n, \n40\n, \n41\n, \n42\n, \n43\n, \n44\n, \n45\n, \n46\n, \n47\n, \n48\n, \n49\n, \n50\n, \n51\n In 21 studies (22.1%), the authors used the proportion of days medication was taken (≥80%) per week.\n52\n, \n53\n, \n54\n, \n55\n, \n56\n, \n57\n, \n58\n, \n59\n, \n60\n, \n61\n, \n62\n, \n63\n, \n64\n, \n65\n, \n66\n, \n67\n, \n68\n, \n69\n, \n70\n, \n71\n, \n72\n The next most frequently used tool was the Hill‐Bone Compliance Questionnaire (n=11, 11.6%).\n73\n, \n74\n, \n75\n, \n76\n, \n77\n, \n78\n, \n79\n, \n80\n, \n81\n, \n82\n, \n83\n The pill count method was used in 6 studies (6.3%),\n84\n, \n85\n, \n86\n, \n87\n, \n88\n, \n89\n and only 1 study used biological assays.\n90\n Most studies were cross‐sectional (n=89, 93.7%), whereas 6 were cohort studies (6.3%). Forty‐eight (50.5%) studies were conducted in urban settings, 5 (5.3%) in rural, and 42 (44.2%) in both urban and rural settings. Almost all the included studies were hospital based (93.7%) (Table 1 and Table S7).Table 1Subgroup Analysis Exploring Differences in Prevalence of Nonadherence to BP‐Lowering Medication in Sub‐Saharan AfricaGrouping variableSubgroupNumber (%) of studiesNumber of observationsPrevalence % (95% CI)τ2\nI2, %\nP value for heterogeneity\nP value for subgroup differencesOverall…95 (100)34 10243.9 (39.2–48.6)0.05499.0<0.001…African regionsCentral SSA9 (8.5)235443.4 (34.1–52.7)0.01995.6<0.00010.647Eastern SSA34 (32.1)11 83543.7 (37.8–49.6)0.02997.9<0.0001Southern SSA13 (12.3)442736.4 (26.6–46.2)0.03298.3<0.0001Western SSA50 (47.2)15 48642.7 (34.9–50.4)0.07899.3<0.001Adherence measurementMMAS‐825 (26.3)11 02040.6 (31.7–49.6)0.05299.2<0.0010.030Hill‐Bone Compliance Questionaire11 (11.6)328148.9 (33.4–64.5)0.06899.1<0.0001MMAS‐410 (10.5)313146.0 (37.6–54.5)0.01895.9<0.0001Morisky‐Green‐Levine scale6 (6.3)211143.3 (14.2–72.4)0.13299.6<0.0001Pill count6 (6.3)243847.8 (28.0–67.6)0.06099.0<0.0001Girerd scale5 (5.3)189648.3 (38.2–58.5)0.01394.2<0.0001Medication Adherence Rating Scale4 (4.2)155161.9 (51.8–71.9)0.01094.4<0.0001Other questionnaires6 (6.3)188730.3 (16.7–43.9)0.02898.2<0.0001Proportion of days per week medication was taken and related21 (22.1)660042.7 (33.9–51.4)0.04198.4<0.0001Risk of biasLow risk67 (70.5)25 73543.4 (37.7–49.2)0.05799.2<0.00010.737Moderate risk28 (29.5)836745.1 (37.1–53.1)0.04598.5<0.0001Median age (57 y)At or above41 (49.4)16 81839.4 (34.1–44.8)0.02998.4<0.0010.048Below42 (50.6)13 29747.9 (41.4–54.4)0.04598.6<0.001SexFemale43 (49.4)990347.4 (40.1–54.7)0.05898.5<0.0010.893Male44 (50.6)16 73348.1 (41.5–54.6)0.04797.2<0.001Median sample size (329 people)At or above50 (52.6)25 54643.9 (37.3–50.5)0.05799.4<0.0010.999Below45 (47.4)855643.9 (37.4–50.4)0.04897.9<0.001Study locationUrban58 (79.5)18 89043.9 (36.8–50.9)0.07499.3<0.0010.295Rural15 (20.5)316949.6 (41.5–57.7)0.02495.6<0.001Study settingHospital89 (93.6)32 69143.8 (38.9–48.7)0.05599.1<0.0010.831Community6 (6.3)141145.4 (32.1–58.6)0.02696.2<0.001Study designCross‐sectional89 (93.6)31 13843.9 (39.1–48.7)0.05399.0<0.0010.966Cohort6 (6.3)296444.4 (20.5–68.3)0.08999.5<0.001Period of data collectionBefore 201013 (13.7)405948.9 (33.9–63.9)0.07499.1<0.00010.9142010 to 201420 (21.1)593544.7 (37.2–52.2)0.02897.3<0.00012015 to 201938 (40.0)15 60743.5 (35.1–51.9)0.06999.4<0.0012020 onward17 (17.9)661040.8 (31.7–49.9)0.03698.7<0.001Not reported7 (7.4)189142.4 (32.6–52.2)0.01695.0<0.001Sampling methodProbabilistic35 (36.8)12 03441.6 (34.5–48.7)0.04598.8<0.0010.631Non‐probabilistic55 (57.9)20 79344.7 (38.4–51.1)0.05699.1<0.001Unclear5 (5.3)127550.7 (31.0–70.4)0.04998.3<0.001Data collection approachInterviewer‐administered89 (93.6)29 98343.5 (38.5–48.5)0.05799.0<0.0010.465Self‐administered6 (6.3)411950.1 (33.0–67.2)0.04599.1<0.001MMAS indicates Morisky Medication Adherence Scale; and SSA, Sub‐Saharan Africa Other questionnaires included the Medication Adherence Questionnaire (1 study), the Brief Medication Questionnaire (1 study), the Adherence to Refills and Medication Scale (2 studies), the Adherence in Chronic Disease Scale (1 study), and the General Medication Adherence Scale (1 study).Quality of the EvidenceAbout three quarters (n=67, 70.5%) of studies were rated as having a low risk of bias, whereas the remaining studies (n=28, 29.5%) had a moderate risk of bias (Tables S8 and S9). Overall, the predominant methodological shortcomings in studies were target populations that were not nationally representative (96.8%), and about two thirds of studies that were based on nonrandom samples (64.2%). However, most studies used an acceptable measurement tool (88.4%), that had good reliability and validity (75.8%).The overall quality of the evidence was rated as moderate certainty, which was driven by the serious inconsistency in estimates between individual studies and the wide prediction intervals around the pooled prevalence. The detailed Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation assessment is shown in Table S10.Burden and Trend in Nonadherence to BP‐Lowering MedicationThe prevalence of nonadherence to BP‐lowering medication from individual studies ranged from 3.5%\n29\n to 92.9%.\n72\n The pooled prevalence of nonadherence across all studies was 43.9% (95% CI, 39.2–48.6). There was substantial between‐study heterogeneity demonstrated in the large weighted SD (18.5%) of the observed study prevalences and heterogeneity statistics (τ2=0.054; I2=99.0%, P<0.0001) (Figure 2). The prediction interval ranged from 0% to 90.3%, suggesting that we can expect the prevalence of nonadherence to BP‐lowering medication from future studies in different settings across SSA to vary within that range. Meta‐regression analysis of all the included evidence published between 1995 and 2023 showed no change in the prevalence of nonadherence over time (estimated relative rate, 1.001 [95% CI, 0.977–1.026]) (Table 1 and Figure S1).Figure 2Meta‐analysis of the prevalence of nonadherence to BP‐lowering medication in Sub‐Saharan Africa.BP indicates blood pressure.Subgroup AnalysesThe burden of nonadherence to BP‐lowering medication varied by age (P=0.048), with younger (<median age 57 years) participants having greater nonadherence compared with older (≥57 years) participants (47.9% versus 39.4%) (Table 1 and Figure S2). Nonadherence also varied by measurement tool (P=0.030). The prevalence of nonadherence was 40.6% (n=25 studies) for the most frequently used tool (Morisky Medication Adherence Scale‐8), lowest (30.3%) among studies using other questionnaires (n=7 studies) and highest (61.9%) in studies using the Medication Adherence Rating Scale (n=4 studies) (Table 1 and Figure S3). There was no sex difference in nonadherence to BP‐lowering medication (47.4%, 43 studies with 9903 women versus 48.1%, 44 studies with 6830 men, P=0.892). There was no statistical difference in the prevalence of nonadherence between Southern SSA (36.4%, n=13 studies) compared with Western SSA (42.7%, n=50 studies), Central SSA (43.4%, n=9 studies), and Eastern SSA (43.7%, n=34 studies) (P=0.646). Similarly, the prevalence of nonadherence did not differ by location (49.6% for rural versus 43.9% for urban; P=0.295), study settings, study design, sample size, sampling method, period of data collection, or data collection approach (Table 1 and Figures S4 through S13).Sensitivity Analysis and Publication BiasIn sensitivity analysis, the prevalence of nonadherence was similar to the main analysis estimate when considering only studies with low risk of bias (Figure S14). However, classifying people in the medium adherence category (n=19 studies) as being nonadherent to their medication resulted in a higher overall prevalence of nonadherence (50.7% [95% CI, 44.2–57.3]) with substantial heterogeneity (τ2=0.106; I2=99.6%) (Figure S15).The influence analysis found no evidence that any individual study significantly influenced the pooled estimate (Figure S16). The Doi plot showed mild asymmetry (Luis‐Furuya Kanamori index=1.34) suggesting a potential for publication bias (Figure S17); however, small studies were not more likely to report extreme prevalence estimates compared with larger studies (P=0.999, Table 1 and Figure S9).Factors Associated With Medication NonadherenceFigure 3 and Table S11 present the details of the predictors of medication nonadherence, which are summarized next.Figure 3Factors associated with medication (non‐)adherence in Sub‐Saharan Africa classified according to the World Health Organization dimensions for adherence to medication in people with hypertension.Note: The upward arrows in green boxes indicate the variable was associated with good medication adherence, and the downward arrows in pink boxes indicate an association with non‐adherence. The number of boxes along each variable indicate the number of studies that reported a significant association between that variable and adherence to BP‐lowering medication. BP indicates blood pressure; and C‐C, calcium channel.Demographic and Socioeconomic FactorsAge, sex, and area: All but 1\n72\n of 6 studies found that being male was associated with nonadherence to medication.\n91\n, \n92\n, \n93\n, \n94\n, \n95\n Additionally, 3 out of 5 studies showed younger adults (generally <40 years) were more likely to be nonadherent to medication compared with older adults,\n51\n, \n87\n, \n96\n but 2 studies found the contrary.\n92\n, \n97\n One study reported that residing in rural areas was associated with nonadherence.\n97\n\nEducation: All 5 studies showed that lower levels of education were associated with nonadherence to medication.\n44\n, \n70\n, \n85\n, \n89\n, \n98\n\nEmployment and income: Being unemployed was associated with poor medication adherence in 4 studies,\n35\n, \n74\n, \n93\n, \n94\n, \n95\n whereas 3 authors found the opposite relationship.\n35\n, \n46\n, \n70\n Additionally, 3\n27\n, \n70\n, \n79\n out of 5 studies reported that higher income/wealth status was associated with good medication adherence, whereas the converse was found in 2 studies.\n74\n, \n96\n\nSocial support: All but 1\n74\n of 4 studies\n35\n, \n44\n, \n74\n, \n78\n noted that having good family/friend support was associated with good medication adherence, with odds ratios (ORs) ranging from 2\n35\n to over 5‐fold.\n78\n\nDistance from health facility: Two studies showed that people experiencing high cost or lack of transport had >3 times the odds of being nonadherent to medication\n75\n, \n95\n; individuals with shorter distances to the hospital had a 2‐fold higher odds of being adherent (adjusted OR [aOR], 2.02 [95% CI, 1.19–3.43]).\n91\n\nMedication cost and availability: Unavailability of medication was associated with nonadherence to medication,\n74\n, \n84\n, \n98\n, \n99\n with the odds ranging from 1.7 (95% CI, 1.1–3.3) in a study in Tanzania\n84\n to 5.4 (95% CI, 1.76–16.85) in Namibia.\n74\n All 7 studies investigating cost coverage for medication found that compared with having free medication or funded by others/insurance/government schemes, self‐funded or out‐of‐pocket costs were associated with nonadherence to medication.\n37\n, \n39\n, \n44\n, \n49\n, \n51\n, \n84\n, \n98\n\nPatient‐Related FactorsActive participation in management: All 8 studies found that patients who actively participated in the management of their BP through regular attendance to clinic appointments,\n74\n, \n78\n, \n94\n health talks,\n95\n having good self‐efficacy\n85\n, \n93\n and not stopping medication when asymptomatic\n73\n, \n84\n were more likely to have good medication adherence.Understanding and perceptions about hypertension: Patients with a good understanding of hypertension were 3 to 9 times as likely to be adherent to their medication compared with those who had a poor understanding of the condition.\n30\n, \n37\n, \n48\n, \n91\n, \n92\n, \n93\n, \n95\n\nKnowledge and skill in managing symptoms and treatment: Patients with adequate knowledge and skill had 3‐ to 13‐fold higher odds of being adherent to medication compared with their counterparts.\n33\n, \n40\n, \n73\n, \n90\n, \n91\n, \n97\n, \n98\n, \n100\n\nPerception of the health risk related to hypertension: All but 1\n30\n of 4 studies found that people with accurate perceptions had higher odds of being adherent to their medication.\n35\n, \n99\n, \n100\n\nComorbidities: In 6 studies, patients with 1 or more comorbidities were over twice as likely to be nonadherent to their medication.\n39\n, \n46\n, \n64\n, \n87\n, \n91\n, \n98\n One study reported that those without a comorbid condition were 4 four times as likely to be adherent to their medication.\n37\n\nAlcohol use and smoking: All studies evaluating the impact of alcohol use\n30\n, \n39\n, \n40\n, \n73\n and smoking\n64\n, \n73\n found that both behaviors were associated with low or nonadherence to medication.Stress and forgetfulness: Patients who reported being stressed were twice as likely to be nonadherent to medication, whereas being forgetful was associated with about 8‐fold higher odds of nonadherence to medication.\n48\n, \n49\n\nOthers: Individuals using nonprescribed medication\n99\n or traditional medications\n27\n were twice as likely to be nonadherent to their BP‐lowering medication. Similarly, being physically inactive (aOR, 1.63 [95% CI, 1.04–2.55]) was associated with nonadherence to medication.\n46\n\nTherapy‐Related FactorsPill burden: Eight studies reported that high pill burden was associated with nonadherence to medication,\n39\n, \n49\n, \n87\n, \n89\n, \n92\n, \n96\n, \n97\n, \n101\n with poorer adherence in people taking 2 or more BP‐lowering pills.\n39\n, \n49\n, \n92\n, \n97\n\nSide effects: All 6 studies showed that those who experienced side effects (such as dizziness,\n75\n palpitation\n73\n) were 2 to 7 times more likely to be nonadherent to their medication.\n40\n, \n49\n, \n73\n, \n75\n, \n85\n, \n99\n\nDuration of diagnosis and treatment: Three studies showed that people who had been diagnosed or on treatment for longer than 1,\n40\n 5,\n101\n or 10 years\n96\n were more likely to be no‐adherent, whereas 2 studies showed that being on treatment for ≥3 years was associated with good medication adherence.\n37\n, \n79\n\nBP control and class of BP‐lowering medication: All 3 studies exploring the relation with BP control found that people with well‐controlled BPs were 2 to 3 times more likely to be adherent to their medication.\n64\n, \n91\n, \n99\n Two studies found a significant relationship between the use of calcium‐channel blockers and medication adherence, although both had differing conclusions.\n27\n, \n40\n\nHealth Care Team/Health System FactorsGood patient–doctor relationships: This was associated with up to 4‐fold higher odds of adherence,\n37\n whereas a poor relationship was associated with nonadherence to medication.\n98\n\nHealth education: Two studies showed that patients who did not receive health education or counseling when attending health facilities were twice as likely to be nonadherent to their medication.\n44\n, \n99\n\nDISCUSSIONThis systematic review provides a comprehensive synthesis of the burden of nonadherence to BP‐lowering medication among adults with hypertension in SSA. At least 2 out of every 5 adults on treatment for hypertension in SSA were nonadherent to their medication. This high burden has remained unchanged during the past 3 decades. Nonadherence was higher in younger (mean age <57 years) adults compared with older adults, and it varied by measurement method. Socioeconomic‐ and patient‐related factors were the most frequently reported drivers of medication adherence in SSA. There was consistent evidence that active patient participation in management, accurate understanding and perceptions, and knowledge of hypertension and its treatment predicted good adherence to medication, whereas high pill burden (mostly >2 pills per day), medication cost, experiencing side effects, and having comorbidities predicted poor adherence.The overall prevalence of nonadherence in this study was lower than the 62.5% and 65.9% reported by previous studies in Africa.\n9\n, \n10\n These reviews had very narrow periods for which data were included, ranging from 7 to 11 years, as opposed to the present review, which pooled data from studies published over the past 3 decades. Nevertheless, the estimates of the present study are on par with findings from a global meta‐analysis that found a prevalence of nonadherence—measured using questionnaires—of 43% in low‐ and middle‐income countries, which was higher than the 26% to 38% reported from high‐income countries.\n8\n\nNonadherence to BP‐lowering medication was higher in studies with younger populations compared with those with older people, consistent with reports from both low‐ and middle‐income countries and high‐income countries.\n8\n, \n13\n, \n102\n Older adults are more likely to have chronic conditions and to dedicate more time to their health and therapy. Furthermore, the use of adherence aids like pill boxes and calendars likely enhances their ability to adhere to medication.\n103\n There was variation in the pooled prevalence of nonadherence by the tool used in assessing medication adherence, which is consistent with previous reviews.\n8\n, \n13\n There is currently no gold standard for measuring adherence. Thus, the observed variation could reflect differences inherent to the respective tools.\n104\n, \n105\n More research is needed to develop standardized cost‐effective and pragmatic tools for assessing medication adherence for research and clinical practice in SSA.Socioeconomic and patient‐related factors were the major drivers reported for nonadherence to BP‐lowering medications. This is consistent with prior systematic reviews.\n10\n, \n11\n, \n13\n However, we found conflicting results for age and employment status. Although some studies showed that older age was associated with good adherence, 3 out of 5 studies reported an inverse relationship. The latter could be due to declining cognitive ability with aging. Being employed is correlated with higher socioeconomic status and access to health care services, which could explain better adherence.\n13\n In contrast, the association between employment and nonadherence could be due to patients prioritizing their job schedules. These mixed results likely indicate a complex relationship between age, employment, and medication adherence and potential differences in study settings.Active patient participation and good knowledge of hypertension and their treatment were the main patient‐specific factors consistently associated with good medication adherence. Targeted interventions promoting these attributes should be a key focus in SSA. There is growing evidence elsewhere about the benefits of active patient involvement in decision‐making about their health and adherence to therapy.\n103\n, \n106\n, \n107\n These benefits include increased satisfaction, quality of life, and improved understanding of hypertension.Comorbidities, experiencing medication side effects, and taking multiple pills were associated with medication nonadherence. Similar results were reported among older adults.\n11\n People with multiple chronic conditions are likely to have a high pill burden and incur significant out‐of‐pocket health expenditures.\n108\n, \n109\n This is a particular challenge for patients in low‐ and middle‐income countries such as SSA with limited insurance or universal health coverage.\n110\n There is strong evidence that most people with high BP require 2 medications to control their BP. Hence, simplifying treatments through single‐pill combinations is likely to address the problem of pill burden and adherence, with spinoffs like improved quality of life, reduced clinical inertia and lower health care costs.\n111\n, \n112\n, \n113\n\nImplications of the FindingsThe population of Africa is projected to increase from 1.4 billion now to ~2.5 billion by 2050, representing the fastest population growth worldwide.\n114\n Our analysis shows the prevalence of nonadherence to BP‐lowering medication has not changed over time. With 1 in 3 adults having hypertension,\n4\n health systems in SSA can expect to manage ~825 million people with hypertension. Assuming this pattern continues, this would approximate to over 350 million patients not adherent to their medication and at increased risk of cardiovascular events. This represents a substantial challenge for already struggling health systems. Hence, in addition to prioritizing primordial prevention, governments in SSA need to develop sustainable long‐term strategies. For example, accelerating progress toward universal health coverage for the delivery of quality and equitable health care for all, and fostering team‐based care to improve health care provider‐patient ratios and relationships.\n115\n Furthermore, with single‐pill combinations now on the World Health Organization Essential Medicines List,\n116\n stakeholders involved in BP control should adopt simple and practical treatment guidelines incorporating single‐pill combinations. Additionally, governments need to facilitate supply chains that enhance the availability of these single‐pill combinations for patients. Such strategies would contribute to improving adherence to therapy, BP control and cardiovascular disease outcomes.Strengths and LimitationsThe review had some limitations. First, most of the included studies were hospital‐based. Hence, the estimate of medication nonadherence may be biased by the “white coat adherence” phenomenon, whereby patients are more adherent in the days leading up to and immediately after their clinic visit.\n117\n, \n118\n Consequently, the prevalence presented in this study may be an underestimation of the true prevalence of medication nonadherence in SSA. Second, over half of the included studies were from Western SSA, with lower representations from central and southern SSA. Furthermore, there were comparatively fewer studies conducted in rural areas. Hence, the estimate from this review might not be generalizable to the whole of SSA. Third, there was substantial heterogeneity between the studies, which was not completely explained by the moderator variables in the prespecified subgroup analyses. However, subgroup analyses and meta‐regression are not without shortcomings. They are liable to the confounding effects of other study‐level characteristics. In addition, they may suffer from aggregation bias with the identification (or not) of relationships from variables based on study‐level averages that are inconsistent with individual‐level analysis.\n119\n Fourth, although most included studies had a low risk of bias, about a quarter had moderate risk of bias which was driven by nonrandom and nonrepresentative samples. The certainty in the overall quality of the evidence was moderate. This implies that although the true burden of nonadherence to BP‐lowering medication is likely to be close to the reported pooled prevalence, there remains a possibility that it is substantially different. Despite these shortcomings, this systematic review provides a comprehensive synthesis of the evidence on the burden, trend and determinants of nonadherence to BP‐lowering medication in SSA.CONCLUSIONSThis systematic review showed a substantially high burden of non‐adherence to BP‐lowering medication among adults with hypertension in SSA; two out of every five adults treated for hypertension are not adherent to their therapy, and this has not changed over the past 3 decades. Targeted policies are needed to address the broad range of socioeconomic, health system, therapy, and patient‐related factors driving this high burden of medication nonadherence in SSA.Sources of FundingNone.DisclosuresAletta E.

We aim to analyze bibliometric features in studies related to PFBC, investigate variant detection rates in patients with brain calcifications, and examine the phenotypic characteristics of PFBC patients. A comprehensive search of studies on the genetic effects of PFBC up until December 31, 2024, was conducted across Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, and Scopus. A random-effects meta-analysis combined variant detection rates for genes SLC20A2, PDGFRB, PDGFB, XPR1, MYORG, JAM2, CMPK2, and NAA60. Data on total calcification scores (TCS), age of onset, and the prevalence of various phenotypes in PFBC patients were also aggregated. Publication bias was assessed using Egger's linear regression, and a leave-one-out sensitivity analysis was performed. Of 1,267 records, 224 were included in the bibliometric analysis. Keywords “primary familial brain calcification” and “SLC20A2” were most prominent. Eighteen articles were included in the meta-analysis, revealing higher variant rates for SLC20A2 (16.7%, 95% CI: 10.0–24.6) and MYORG (16.8%, 95% CI: 0.0–54.0), which were associated with higher TCS. The average age of onset was 43.69 years (95% CI: 36.17–51.21). Cognitive impairment (45.3%, 95% CI: 35.7–55.1) and psychiatric symptoms (30.8%, 95% CI: 17.2–46.2) had relatively higher prevalence rates. No significant publication bias was found (p > 0.05), and the sensitivity analysis confirmed the results’ robustness. SLC20A2 and MYORG variants had higher detection rates, with cognitive impairment and psychiatric symptoms being common in PFBC patients. Continued research is essential to further explore these genetic variants.", "body": "Significance StatementThis study reveals that SLC20A2 and MYORG gene variants are key drivers of primary familial brain calcification (PFBC), a neurodegenerative disorder marked by brain calcium deposits. Using global data, we show these variants correlate with severe calcification and frequently manifest as cognitive decline or psychiatric symptoms, while nearly a quarter of patients remain asymptomatic. By integrating genetic and clinical analyses, we provide the first systematic comparison of PFBC-associated genes and phenotypes, offering critical insights for diagnosis, genetic counseling, and mechanistic research. These findings highlight the need for expanded screening of understudied genes and global collaborations to address gaps in understanding this underdiagnosed condition, ultimately guiding therapeutic strategies for affected individuals.IntroductionPrimary familial brain calcification (PFBC) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder characterized by bilateral brain calcifications in the basal ganglia. In 1974, the term “idiopathic basal ganglia calcification” was first introduced to describe two cases of familial basal ganglia calcification, which presented with characteristics of “dystonic deformities” and unexplained brain calcification (Caraceni et al., 1974). Over the following decades, studies on familial clusters suggested a potential genetic etiology for this idiopathic basal ganglia calcification (Foley, 1951; Boller et al., 1977; Ellie et al., 1989). It was not until 2012, when the first dominant genetic factor, SLC20A2, was identified (Wang et al., 2012), that the genetic basis of PFBC was firmly established. PFBC is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern (Guo et al., 2019), and to date, four dominant pathogenic genes have been identified: SLC20A2 (Wang et al., 2012), PDGFRB (Nicolas et al., 2013b), PDGFB (Keller et al., 2013), and XPR1 (Legati et al., 2015). In recent years, four recessive pathogenic genes, MYORG (Yao et al., 2018), JAM2 (Cen et al., 2020), CMPK2 (Zhao et al., 2022), and NAA60 (Chelban et al., 2024), have also been discovered. Among these, the role of CMPK2 in PFBC pathogenesis has not been independently replicated, and its potential as a causative gene remains under debate.The clinical phenotype of PFBC is heterogeneous, encompassing motor disturbances, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and, in a significant proportion of cases, the absence of obvious symptoms (Manyam et al., 2001; Nicolas et al., 2015; Tadic et al., 2015). Disease onset can occur at any age, although more than half of patients typically develop symptoms between the ages of 30 and 50 years (Nicolas et al., 2015). Currently, PFBC diagnosis is supported by the detection of brain calcifications through computed tomography (CT) scans, with confirmation through the identification of pathogenic variants in one of these eight PFBC-associated genes (Legati et al., 2015; Westenberger et al., 2019). While traditionally considered rare, recent population-based genomic analyses suggest PFBC is more common than previously thought, though frequently underdiagnosed (Nicolas et al., 2018). Epidemiological inference based on genetic screening suggests an overall prevalence of PFBC of up to 0.66% (Chen et al., 2019). Therefore, the impact of PFBC on global health needs to be further emphasized.Previous studies have indicated that among the known PFBC-associated genes, variants in SLC20A2 are the most common, accounting for ∼40% of familial cases (David et al., 2016). SLC20A2 encodes the transmembrane sodium-inorganic phosphate cotransporter PiT-2, which plays a crucial role in phosphate clearance from cerebrospinal fluid (Jensen et al., 2016). Additionally, XPR1 is also implicated in phosphate transport, with functional studies showing that variants in XPR1 severely impair its membrane localization and phosphate efflux activity (Legati et al., 2015; Anheim et al., 2016). The loss of NAA60 function may also reduce extracellular phosphate uptake by impairing the cell membrane expression of the SLC20A2 gene (Chelban et al., 2024). In addition to pathophysiological factors related to phosphate metabolism disorders, genes encoding platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGF-Rβ) and its ligand (PDGFB and PDGFRB), as well as recessive pathogenic genes MYORG and JAM2, may compromise blood–brain barrier (BBB) integrity by damaging the neurovascular unit (NVU). Increased BBB permeability could allow high concentrations of phosphate in the blood to infiltrate the brain, ultimately contributing to calcification (Xu et al., 2023). Given the rapid progress in PFBC research and its associated pathogenic genes, understanding trends and advancements in this field is crucial.However, there remains a lack of systematic assessments and comparisons regarding the variant detection rates, severity, and age of onset of different PFBC-related pathogenic genes in patients with brain calcifications. Furthermore, there is insufficient evaluation of the prevalence of clinical phenotypes in PFBC patients, as well as a comprehensive review of past research on PFBC and its associated pathogenic genes. Therefore, this study aims to address these gaps in the literature by conducting a meta-analysis, incorporating bibliometric perspectives, to identify key research trends and hotspots in PFBC, as well as to determine the variant detection rates of PFBC-related genes in patients with brain calcifications and the phenotypic characteristics of PFBC patients.Materials and MethodsSearch strategyTwo researchers systematically searched studies published up until December 31, 2024, in PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science databases, with no language restrictions. The search was performed using the following keyword combination: (“calcification” OR PFBC OR IBGC OR “Fahr disease”) AND (SLC20A2 OR PDGFRB OR PDGFB OR XPR1 OR MYORG OR JAM2 OR CMPK2 OR NAA60). References from relevant systematic or narrative reviews identified in the search were also screened for additional studies. Given the need for citation databases in bibliometric analysis, and the inability to integrate other databases (Archambault et al., 2009; Aria and Cuccurullo, 2017), the bibliometric analysis was limited to studies indexed in the Web of Science Core Collection (WOSCC), specifically the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE) and the Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI). Bibliometric data were exported as “plain text” files containing full records and references.Selection criteriaFor bibliometric analysis, we included all studies from the WOSCC database related to the pathogenic genes of PFBC with available bibliometric data. Studies such as letters, conference abstracts, corrigenda, and editorials were excluded.For the meta-analysis, we included studies that performed gene sequencing and screening in patients with brain calcifications identified by imaging features, reporting variants in at least one of the following genes: SLC20A2, PDGFRB, PDGFB, XPR1, MYORG, JAM2, CMPK2, and NAA60. Studies were excluded if they met any of the following criteria: (1) animal studies; (2) case reports, series with fewer than 15 cases, or reviews; (3) duplicate studies from the same population; and (4) missing or uncalculable key outcome data. When multiple publications reported on the same population, we included the publication with the largest sample size, longest follow-up period, or most comprehensive study outcomes. The studies were selected independently by two researchers, with disagreements resolved by consulting a third author.Bibliometric analysisWe recorded information including the title, institution, source (journal or book), authors, references, subject area, and keywords using Microsoft Excel. Analysis was performed using the “bibliometrix” package in R version 4.3.1 (Aria and Cuccurullo, 2017) and CiteSpace software (version 6.2.R2 Basic). Indicators such as Total Citation (TC), Local Citation (LC), Normalized Total Citation (NTC), Normalized Local Citation (NLC), Average Article Citation (AAC), Articles Fractionalized (AF), and the H-index were applied to evaluate the impact and research output of countries, journals, authors, or studies.Meta-analysisThe meta-analysis was conducted following the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines (Stroup et al., 2000). Two researchers independently assessed study eligibility and extracted relevant data from all included studies, including the title, first author's name, publication year, country or region of the study population, sample size, study type, gene sequencing method, number of screened patients, genes screened, number of patients with identified gene variants, total calcification score (TCS), age at disease onset, disease phenotypes, and the number of occurrences for each phenotype. Any discrepancies in data extraction were resolved through consensus.The methodological quality of cross-sectional studies was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Checklist (Zeng et al., 2015), which evaluates eight dimensions, each rated as Yes, Unclear, No, or Not Applicable. A study was considered high quality if at least six “Yes” responses were obtained with no “No” responses. Additionally, the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS; Stang, 2010) was used to assess the methodological quality of cohort and case–control studies, with a score of ≥7 considered high quality. A follow-up period longer than 2 years was considered sufficiently long. All quality assessments were performed independently by two researchers, with discrepancies resolved through consensus and the involvement of a third researcher.The primary outcome of this study was the variant detection rate of variants in SLC20A2, PDGFRB, PDGFB, XPR1, MYORG, JAM2, CMPK2, and NAA60 in patients with brain calcifications. The variant rate was calculated based on unrelated families and probands, with no repeated participants. Secondary outcomes included the age of onset, severity of brain calcification, and the prevalence of phenotypes in PFBC patients. The severity of brain calcification was assessed using the TCS score. Our classification of disease phenotypes was based on the descriptions reported in the included studies and was divided into Headache, Cognitive Disorder, Movement Disorder, Mental Symptom, Dysarthria, and Asymptomatic. These phenotypes were accurately defined in the original studies, from which detailed information can be obtained. We used a random-effects model to pool outcome data and calculate 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Heterogeneity between studies was assessed using Cochrane's Q test and the I2 statistic, with I2 values exceeding 50 and 75% considered moderate and high heterogeneity, respectively (Higgins et al., 2003). For outcomes related to the severity of brain calcification, we performed subgroup analyses based on the mutated gene and used the Z-test to assess intergroup differences. Egger's linear regression test was used to evaluate publication bias (Egger et al., 1997). A Baujat plot was employed to explore sources of heterogeneity further (Baujat et al., 2002). Sensitivity analysis was conducted using the “leave-one-out” method to assess the robustness of the pooled results (Deeks et al., 2019). In all statistical analyses, a p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses for the meta-analysis were performed using the meta package in R version 4.3.1.ResultsBibliometric characteristicsA total of 320 publications were identified through the WOSCC database. After excluding 96 studies that did not meet the inclusion criteria, 224 studies were included in the bibliometric analysis (Fig. 1). The publications spanned the years 2012–2024. Among these studies, 193 were original articles (86.16%) and 31 were reviews (13.84%), involving 1,551 authors, 400 keywords, 4,168 references, and 113 sources (journals or books). On average, each article was cited 24.82 times, and each article was written by 10.5 authors. International collaborative research accounted for 28.12% of the total publications. The average annual growth rate of publications in this field was 18.06%.Figure 1.Flow diagram including reasons for exclusion of full-text articles.In the research area of PFBC-related gene variants, publication frequency analysis, including co-authors, revealed that China and France had the highest publication rates, while there was a notable lack of research from the Arabian Peninsula and Africa. Additionally, studies from France had the highest citation rates (Fig. 2A). The analysis of interregional collaborations showed that the highest collaboration frequencies occurred between the United States, Brazil, and France, highlighting the dominant role of the United States in international cooperation (Fig. 2B). Driven by global research efforts, the number of publications and citations in this field has shown a steady increase year by year (Fig. 2C).Figure 2.Information of regions on relevant research. A, Distribution of regions contributing to the field. B, Regions’ collaboration world map. C, Trends in the number of publications and citations.The study by Wang et al. (2012) in 2012, titled “Variants in SLC20A2 link familial idiopathic basal ganglia calcification with phosphate homeostasis,” had the highest TC and LC. In contrast, the 2018 study by Yao et al. (2018) in Neuron, titled “Biallelic variants in MYORG cause autosomal recessive primary familial brain calcification”, had the highest NTC and NLC. These two studies are the most influential in the field, representing the discovery of the first dominant and recessive genetic variants associated with PFBC, respectively, and have made significant contributions to research on PFBC-related genetic variants (Table 1). Dr. Nicolas has the highest h-index, publication volume, TC, and LC, indicating the greatest influence in this field. The top 20 most influential authors maintain a relatively stable annual publication rate, with articles published in 2013 and 2015 receiving the most citations (Fig. 3). Regarding the sources of publications, the Journal of Molecular Neuroscience published the largest number of articles on PFBC, while Nature Genetics had the highest TC and Scientific Reports had the highest h-index. Among all source journals, the 11 journals with the highest publication volumes, including the Journal of Molecular Neuroscience, were identified as core journals according to Bradford's Law (Weinstock, 1971).Figure 3.Bibliometric analysis of authors: (A) plots of the top 20 most produced authors’ H-index and citation data; (B) authors’ production over time of the top 10 most productive authors.

Among these, “primary familial brain calcification” and “SLC20A2” had the largest node sizes and betweenness centrality, indicating the strongest co-occurrence and making them the most important keywords. Notably, other related genes, such as “PDGFRB,” “MYORG,” “XPR1,” and “JAM2,” as well as phenotypic traits like “dementia” and “parkinsonism,” also exhibited significant node sizes (Fig. 4A). In the co-citation network analysis of all studies, articles were divided into two major clusters. The articles by Nicolas, Keller, and Wang had the largest node sizes, indicating strong co-citation relationships between these studies (Fig. 4B).Figure 4.Co-occurrence and network analysis.

D, Journal analysis in the research field of genetic effects in PFBC. The dual-map overlay of journals on PFBC generated by CiteSpace software. Specifically, the labels represented different research subjects covered by the journals. Different colored lines correspond to the different paths of references, starting from the citing journals (left half) to the cited journals (right half). The main citing journals were shown in the blue box and the main cited journals were shown in the green box.In the network analysis of institutional collaborations, the institution with the highest activity in related research was the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM). The highest co-occurrence rate was observed between INSERM and the University of Rouen Normandy, indicating broad collaboration between these two institutions. Additionally, Zhejiang University in China exhibited the highest betweenness centrality, while Gifu Pharmaceutical University and Gifu University in Japan had the highest closeness centrality, making them key institutions in facilitating collaboration within the field (Fig. 4C).The dual-map overlay analysis of citing and cited journals revealed the disciplinary distribution of these journals. The left half of the map represents citing journals, while the right half represents cited journals. The colored lines represent citations and show the relationship between citing and cited journal articles. The results indicated that one of the primary citation pathways in PFBC-related research is from Molecular Biology & Genetics (cited journals) to Molecular Biology & Immunology (citing journals), highlighting the continued focus on basic research. “Genetics,” “Immunology,” and “Molecular Biology” remain core areas of focus, while the clinical translational significance of PFBC-related research requires further exploration (Fig. 4D).Study characteristics of meta-analysisBased on the bibliometric analysis, a total of 1,267 records were identified through database and manual searches. After determining the eligibility of the studies for full-text review, 81 studies were assessed, and following a detailed evaluation, 18 studies were included in the meta-analysis (Fig. 1). These studies, published between 2013 and 2021, spanned six regions, five PFBC-related genes, and six types of PFBC-related clinical phenotypes (Table 2). A quality assessment of the methodologies of the 12 cross-sectional studies (Chen et al., 2013; Baker et al., 2014; Sanchez-Contreras et al., 2014; Nicolas et al., 2015; Anheim et al., 2016; David et al., 2016; Gebus et al., 2017; Ramos et al., 2018; Giorgio et al., 2019; Grangeon et al., 2019; Chelban et al., 2020; Kurita et al., 2021), two case–control studies(Nicolas et al., 2013a; Hozumi et al., 2018), and four cohort studies(Hsu et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2019, 2020; Guo et al., 2019) included in the meta-analysis was performed (Table 3). All included studies were of high quality, with two case–control studies receiving a score of 9 on the NOS scale.Table 2.Characteristics of the 18 included in meta-analysisAuthorYearCountryStudy DesignSample SizeReported GeneReported PhenotypeChen et al.2013ChinaCS20 (14 Familial + 6 Sporadic)\nSLC20A2\nHeadache, movement disorder, dysarthria, asymptomaticNicolas et al.2013FranceCC72 (19 Familial + 6 Sporadic + 47 Probable PFBC)\nSLC20A2, PDGFRB\nCognitive disorder, movement disorder, mental symptom, asymptomaticHsu et al.2013USARC218 (All Familial)\nSLC20A2\nN.A.Baker et al.2014USACS27 (All Familial)\nSLC20A2\nN.A.Sanchez et al.2014USACS26 (All Familial)\nPDGFRB, PDGFB\nN.A.Nicolas et al.2015FranceCS57 (46 Familial + 11 Sporadic)\nSLC20A2, PDGFRB, PDGFB\nCognitive disorder, movement disorder, mental symptom, asymptomaticAnheim et al.2016FranceCS18 (All Sporadic)\nXPR1\nMovement disorderDavid et al.2016FranceCS24 (14 Familial + 10 Sporadic)\nSLC20A2\nheadache, cognitive disorder, mental symptomGebus et al.2017FranceCS80 (All Sporadic)\nSLC20A2, PDGFRB, PDGFB, XPR1\nCognitive disorder, movement disorderRamos et al.2018ItalyCS177 (All Familial)\nSLC20A2, PDGFRB, PDGFB, XPR1\nCognitive disorder, movement disorder, mental symptom, asymptomaticHozumi et al.2018JapanCC42 (29 Familial + 13 HC)\nSLC20A2, PDGFB\nN.A.Chen et al.2019ChinaRC273 (All Familial)\nSLC20A2, PDGFRB, PDGFB, XPR1\nHeadache, movement disorderChen et al.2020ChinaRC435 (All Familial)\nMYORG\nMovement disorder, dysarthria, mental symptomGiorgio et al.2019ItalyCS50 (All Sporadic)\nSLC20A2\nHeadache, movement disorder, mental symptom, asymptomaticGrangeon et al.2019FranceCS29 (All Familial)\nMYORG\nCognitive disorder, asymptomaticGuo et al.2019ChinaRC226 (35 Familial + 191 Sporadic)\nSLC20A2, PDGFRB, PDGFB, XPR1\nheadache, movement disorder, asymptomaticChelban et al.2020UKCS86 (All Familial)\nMYORG\nHeadache, cognitive disorder, movement disorder, dysarthria, asymptomaticKurita et al.2021JapanCS173 (All Sporadic)\nSLC20A2, PDGFRB\nHeadacheCS, cross-sectional study; CC, case–control study; RC, retrospective cohort study; HC, healthy control; Ref, reference.Table 3.Methodological quality evaluation of the 18 studies included in the meta-analysisStudyMajor components of JBI checklist for cross-sectional studiesWere the criteria for inclusion in the sample clearly defined?Were the study subjects and the setting described in detail?Was the exposure measured in a valid and reliable way?Were objective criteria used for measurement of the condition?Were confounding factors identified?Were strategies to deal with confounding factors stated?Were the outcomes measured in a valid and reliable way?Was appropriate statistical analysis used?\nChen et al.

The random-effects model indicated that 16.7% (95% CI: 10.0–24.6, I2 = 86%) of patients exhibited genetic variants in the SLC20A2 gene region. Eight studies screened the PDGFRB gene region, finding 4.3% (95% CI: 0.4–11.3, I2 = 92%) of patients with variants in this region. Seven studies focused on the PDGFB gene region, with 3.3% (95% CI: 0.0–11.0, I2 = 91%) of patients exhibiting variants. Five studies analyzed the XPR1 gene region, reporting a variant rate of 0.7% (95% CI: 0.0–2.4, I2 = 57%). Three studies assessed the MYORG gene region, revealing a variant rate of 16.8% (95% CI: 0.0–54.0, I2 = 96%; Fig. 5). Egger's linear regression analysis suggested no significant publication bias (p > 0.05).Figure 5.Forest plots of primary outcome in meta-analysis. A, SLC20A2 variant detection rate combined result. B, PDGFRB variant detection rate combined result. C, PDGFB variant detection rate combined result. D, XPR1 variant detection rate combined result. E, MYORG variant detection rate combined result.Except for the five studies reporting variants in the XPR1 gene, which exhibited moderate heterogeneity, the other four outcomes displayed high heterogeneity. The Baujat plot indicated that the studies by Gebus et al. (2017), Chen et al. (2019), Nicolas et al. (2015), and four studies by Chen et al. (2019) were the primary sources of heterogeneity for the studies on SLC20A2, PDGFRB, PDGFB, and MYORG, respectively. However, sensitivity analysis using the “leave-one-out” method showed that the combined results were robust, as excluding any single study did not significantly alter the outcomes.Phenotypic characteristics of PFBC patientsEight studies reported TCS scores for PFBC patients. The random-effects model showed that patients with variants in the PDGFB gene region had an average TCS score of 13.99 (95% CI: 5.10–22.87, I2 = 81%), while patients with variants in the SLC20A2 gene region had an average TCS score of 33.72 (95% CI: 25.01–42.42, I2 = 95%). Patients with variants in the MYORG gene region had an average TCS score of 35.06 (95% CI: 24.00–46.12, I2 = 56%). Z-test results showed significant differences in TCS scores between different genes (p < 0.01), with patients harboring variants in the XPR1 (7.30, 95%CI: 2.03–12.57) and PDGFRB (13.99, 95%CI: 5.10–22.87) region exhibiting lower TCS scores compared with those with variants in other genes, although only one study reported TCS score data for the XPR1 gene and thus the random-effects model could not be used for pooling. Except for the MYORG gene region, which showed moderate heterogeneity, the other studies demonstrated considerable heterogeneity (Fig. 6A). Additionally, 10 studies reported the onset age of PFBC symptoms. The random-effects model indicated that the average age of onset for PFBC patients was 43.69 years (95% CI: 36.17–51.21, I2 = 98%; Fig. 6B).Figure 6.Forest plot of secondary outcome in meta-analysis.

H, Combined results of asymptomatic phenotype rate.In the meta-analysis of various clinical phenotypes in PFBC patients, the random-effects model indicated the following prevalence rates: headache occurred in 26.4% (95% CI: 15.5–38.8, I2 = 71%) of patients (Fig. 6C); cognitive impairment was present in 45.3% (95% CI: 35.7–55.1, I2 = 67%; Fig. 6D); movement disorders were observed in 26.4% (95% CI: 16.2–37.8, I2 = 88%; Fig. 6E); psychiatric symptoms were observed in 30.8% (95% CI: 17.2–46.2, I2 = 81%; Fig. 6F); dysarthria were observed in 25.5% (95% CI: 13.3–39.8, I2 = 71%; Fig. 6G); and asymptomatic cases were observed in 23.5% (95% CI: 12.7–36.1, I2 = 86%; Fig. 6H). Egger's linear regression analysis indicated no significant publication bias (p > 0.05). Except for headache, cognitive impairment, and speech disorder phenotypes, which showed moderate heterogeneity, the remaining outcomes exhibited high heterogeneity. Sensitivity analysis using the “leave-one-out” method confirmed that the combined results were robust and unaffected by the exclusion of any individual study.DiscussionThis integrative analysis identifies SLC20A2 and MYORG as predominant genetic contributors to PFBC, with distinct neuropsychiatric manifestations (cognitive deficits, psychiatric symptoms) representing hallmark clinical features. The mid-adult disease onset pattern reinforces PFBC's characterization as a neurodegenerative disorder with presymptomatic calcification progression. These findings position SLC20A2 and MYORG variants as critical molecular markers while underscoring the need to disentangle mechanisms underlying its striking phenotypic heterogeneity.In the keyword network analysis, SLC20A2 exhibited the largest node area among all related genes. Moreover, in the meta-analysis, variants associated with SLC20A2 showed the highest detection rates, and patients carrying these variants had significantly higher TCS scores. The pathogenic effect of SLC20A2 variants remains unclear, but one possible explanation is that variants in SLC20A2 disrupt the normal function of PiT-2, leading to phosphate homeostasis imbalance. This causes excessive phosphate absorption by brain cells, particularly astrocytes, resulting in calcium phosphate crystal deposition in brain tissue. These calcifications can accumulate in various regions of the brain, including the basal ganglia (Wallingford et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2023).The XPR1 gene also contributes to pathogenesis by directly impairing phosphate transport in brain cells and inhibiting the storage of phosphate by suppressing the intracellular accumulation of polyphosphates (Mailer et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2023). In addition, in our meta-analysis we observed that XPR1 was associated with lower TCS scores. The differential impact of XPR1 and SLC20A2 variants on calcification severity may stem from their distinct roles in phosphate homeostasis. Although both genes encode phosphate transporters, SLC20A2 (PiT-2) mediates constitutive cellular phosphate uptake across the blood–brain barrier and the choroid plexus (Jensen et al., 2016), thereby directly affecting the clearance of phosphate from the cerebrospinal fluid. Consequently, complete loss-of-function mutations in SLC20A2 may result in systemic phosphate dysregulation, predisposing patients to widespread calcification. In contrast, XPR1 primarily regulates phosphate efflux via its plasma membrane localization, functioning as a “phosphate sensor” that modulates cellular output through a feedback mechanism (Legati et al., 2015; Anheim et al., 2016). This functional specialization suggests that XPR1 variants may retain partial phosphate efflux capacity through residual transporter activity or compensatory pathways, thereby potentially limiting the calcification burden.In addition to the phosphate metabolism pathway, some studies suggest that the pathogenic effects of variants in other genes may be related to damage to the NVU. The NVU, as the smallest functional unit of the brain, plays a crucial role in regulating cerebral blood flow and maintaining the integrity of the BBB. Dysfunction of the NVU can disrupt normal exchanges of substances between the blood and brain parenchyma. If the BBB is compromised, increased permeability may allow high concentrations of phosphate in the blood to infiltrate the brain, with PDGFRB, PDGFB, MYORG, and JAM2 genes potentially affecting BBB integrity (Xu et al., 2023). The dominant genes PDGFB/PDGFRB, which function as a ligand–receptor pair, help maintain neurovascular unit stability by regulating pericyte recruitment; the associated calcification phenotype may be related to local BBB disruption in the basal ganglia (Keller et al., 2013; Nicolas et al., 2013b). In contrast, the recessive genes MYORG and JAM2 impair the BBB through different mechanisms: MYORG regulates the astrocyte-mediated transport of endothelial tight junction proteins (Yao et al., 2018), while JAM2, being closely associated with tight junctions, directly maintains the integrity of the paracellular barrier (Yang et al., 2025). It is noteworthy that both “NVU” and “PiT-2” also appear as important nodes in the keyword network, marking significant directions for future research.According to the results of the meta-analysis, the prevalence of cognitive disorders among PFBC patients was found to be the highest (45.3%) among all clinical phenotypes, followed by psychiatric disorders (30.8%). In the keyword network, “dementia” was also identified as an important node. One possible explanation for this is that excessive extracellular phosphate can lead to tissue toxicity (Hong et al., 2015) and neuroinflammation (Brown, 2020), which in turn damages surrounding brain tissue and impairs normal brain functions, causing common neurological and psychiatric symptoms in PFBC patients, such as memory loss, mood swings, and behavioral abnormalities (Suescun et al., 2019; Dunn et al., 2020). Additionally, “Parkinsonism” was also an important node in the keyword network. Although our results show that the prevalence of movement disorders was relatively low, the majority of studies in the meta-analysis reported on the occurrence of movement disorders, making this an important focus in PFBC research. Movement disorders may arise from motor neuron damage, abnormal neural conduction, or lesions in specific brain regions caused by brain calcification, especially when neural pathways between the basal ganglia and the cerebral cortex are affected. While this symptom is relatively rare among PFBC patients, when present, it significantly impacts the quality of life. Therefore, movement disorders remain an important area of concern in clinical research on PFBC and should be prioritized in early screening and clinical evaluation of the disease.It is also worth noting that the meta-analysis observed that approximately one-fifth of PFBC patients were asymptomatic, while another one-fifth reported headaches, which is consistent with the rate of asymptomatic cases reported in a 2015 systematic review (Tadic et al., 2015). The genetic features of PFBC exhibit incomplete penetrance, meaning not all individuals carrying pathogenic variants will present with clinical symptoms. This incomplete penetrance may be related to variant type, the functional impact of the variants, and the timing of gene expression. Additionally, with advancing age, PFBC symptoms may gradually manifest, particularly in the context of neurodegeneration. Early carriers may not exhibit noticeable clinical signs due to their younger age or early physiological stage. As they age, the cumulative effects of brain calcification and neurodegenerative changes may promote the onset of clinical symptoms. Lastly, gene interactions, compensatory mechanisms, and gene–environment interactions may also influence the phenotypes of variant carriers. Certain carriers may have genetic interactions that are not yet fully understood, which could partially or fully compensate for the negative effects of the pathogenic variant, thereby preventing the appearance of symptoms. The heterogeneity of PFBC clinical phenotypes presents a challenge for clinical diagnosis and disease screening. Some asymptomatic variant carriers may only develop symptoms later due to specific environmental or physiological triggers, emphasizing the need for more research to support early screening and monitoring for PFBC.In most of the outcomes from the meta-analyses, significant statistical heterogeneity was observed between studies. This variability may be attributed to differences in study populations, as the ratio of sporadic to familial cases varies across studies. Additionally, methodological heterogeneity in gene sequencing protocols contributes to the variability. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) method is more robust and less prone to missing variants compared with whole exome sequencing (WES; Belkadi et al., 2015). This suggests that future research should prioritize WGS when possible. The Baujat plot identified the study by Chen et al. in 2019 (Chen et al., 2019) as the primary source of heterogeneity, as it reported lower variant detection rates for PDGFRB compared with other studies. This study employed a retrospective cohort design, categorizing patients into a “systemic group” and a “nonsystemic group.” The “systemic group” consisted of 37 probands diagnosed at the Department of Neurology, Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, while the “nonsystemic group” comprised 236 probands with cerebral calcification identified by imaging at other study centers. Patients with PFBC in the systemic group were ultimately diagnosed through outpatient clinics due to the presence of neurological symptoms, whereas those in the nonsystemic group were identified with calcification through imaging examinations and did not necessarily have neurological symptoms. It is possible that by including more asymptomatic individuals, this has expanded the study population to a certain extent, thereby introducing heterogeneity. It should be noted that, in addition to study design, the ratio of sporadic to familial cases included may also contribute to the high heterogeneity. For example, in the included studies, the research by Gebus et al. (Gebus et al., 2017) consisted solely of sporadic cases, which significantly differed from other studies (Table 2). Sporadic cases may be subject to substantial selection bias at the time of inclusion, with some sporadic patients potentially being overlooked due to atypical symptoms. For this reason, that study became the primary source of heterogeneity in the meta-analysis of SLC20A2 detection rates.Our study offers several advantages. First, it is the first meta-analysis to focus on the variant detection rates of various genes and the prevalence of different phenotypes in brain calcification patients. Additionally, we incorporated bibliometric perspectives by quantitatively exploring the characteristics and trends of the studies, and we used a random-effects model to combine the relevant outcomes. Second, we conducted a systematic search of databases and comprehensively included all 18 studies that met the inclusion criteria, all of which exhibited high methodological quality. Despite the high heterogeneity in some outcomes, no significant publication bias was detected between studies, and sensitivity analysis suggested robust results. Lastly, our bibliometric analysis was based on the WOSCC database, which includes complete citation networks for high-quality literature, ensuring the data's quality and authority (Wang and Waltman, 2016; Yeung, 2019).However, there are several limitations to our study. First, although we used various methods, such as the Baujat plot and “leave-one-out” analysis, to explore the sources of heterogeneity, the exact sources of heterogeneity between studies have not been fully elucidated. Due to the limited number of studies included for each outcome, we were unable to perform meta-regression for further investigation. Additionally, some early studies did not differentiate between primary and secondary brain calcification, and there is a lack of studies from the Arabian Peninsula and Africa. A higher representation of affected individuals in the studies may introduce selection bias, making the combined results less generalizable to other populations. Secondly, certain outcomes were based on a limited number of studies, such as those reporting MYORG variant detection rates and the prevalence of dysarthria phenotypes, which were derived from only three studies, potentially compromising the accuracy of the results. Furthermore, as JAM2 and CMPK2 were discovered later, no studies meeting the inclusion criteria were available for these genes. Earlier identified genes, such as SLC20A2, may introduce estimation bias due to the relatively higher number of reports, leading to higher variant detection rates and TCS scores. Some potential PFBC pathogenic genes have not yet been discovered, and the detection rates of these undiscovered genes in the calcification population cannot be determined. Finally, due to design limitations, we were unable to compare calcification scores and the incidence rates of asymptomatic patients with age, despite evidence suggesting that the clinical expressivity of calcification correlates with age.Our study has significant clinical implications. First, it provides a deeper understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms and research trends associated with PFBC, offering new insights into the molecular mechanisms of human brain function and neurodegenerative diseases. Clinically, our findings have implications for diagnosis and genetic counseling and provide valuable reference points for assessing prognosis and treatment outcomes. Genetic screening can be used to aid the diagnosis of brain calcification patients, in conjunction with common clinical phenotypic features of PFBC, improving diagnostic accuracy and enhancing patients’ quality of life. Future research should focus on variants related to JAM2, CMPK2, and NAA60, using more clinical data for validation, especially as the pathogenic effect of CMPK2 on PFBC has yet to be independently replicated by other research groups. Further studies should also aim to expand the sample size and geographic scope, explore other potential pathogenic genes and variants, and analyze the associations and differences between different genotypes and phenotypes. Additionally, although current PFBC-related research is concentrated in China and France, it is essential to investigate pathogenic gene variants in brain calcification patients from other regions worldwide. Collaborative efforts between regional research institutions are needed to promote global research in this field. Finally, considering that current research focuses primarily on basic medical disciplines, and the keyword network shows a higher focus on “case report” type studies, future research could explore individual cases to identify potential therapeutic targets and emphasize clinical translational significance. The highly cited literature summarized in our study can provide valuable guidance.ConclusionIn PFBC patients, the SLC20A2 and MYORG genes exhibit higher variant detection rates and tend to have higher TCS scores. Additionally, cognitive impairment and psychiatric symptom phenotypes have a higher prevalence in PFBC patients compared with other phenotypes, with ∼23.5% of patients remaining asymptomatic. Research on the genetic variants associated with PFBC has generated several hot topics. Institutions and researchers from different countries need to establish connections for more in-depth studies on the pathogenic mechanisms, clinical translation, and treatment of PFBC.Data AvailabilityThe data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request."}

IntroductionThe dual burden of heart failure (HF) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has emerged as a growing health concern globally.[1,2] HF is one of the most prevalent cardiovascular complications in T2DM patients, with a notably elevated incidence and poorer prognosis.[3,4] Approximately 40% of HF patients concurrently suffer from T2DM, a proportion that continues to escalate, posing significant challenges to patients’ quality of life and survival prognosis.[5] Consequently, exploring effective therapeutic strategies to improve clinical outcomes in this patient population is of paramount importance.Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors have emerged as key agents in the management of T2DM, primarily by inhibiting the SGLT-2 in the kidneys, leading to enhanced glucose excretion and improved glycemic control. Recent studies have identified additional mechanisms by which these drugs may exert beneficial effects on cardiovascular and renal health. Studies[6–8] have suggested that SGLT-2 inhibitors may reduce oxidative stress, improve endothelial function, and offer protection against HF and chronic kidney disease in diabetic and non-diabetic populations.In recent years, SGLT-2 inhibitors, a novel class of oral hypoglycemic agents, have shown unique advantages in the treatment of diabetes and its complications.[9,10] By inhibiting the reabsorption of glucose in the proximal tubules of the kidney, SGLT-2 inhibitors facilitate the excretion of glucose in the urine, thereby achieving glycemic control.[11] This mechanism not only ensures effective blood glucose management, but also significantly reduces the risk of cardiovascular and renal diseases.[12] In particular, the application of SGLT-2 inhibitors in the treatment of patients with HF and T2DM has garnered considerable attention.[13]Several large-scale clinical trials have corroborated the remarkable efficacy of SGLT-2 inhibitors in reducing the risk of HF hospitalization, cardiovascular mortality, and improving renal outcomes.[14–16] However, due to variations in study populations, design protocols, and follow-up durations, heterogeneity exists among these findings. Therefore, a systematic evaluation of the efficacy and safety of SGLT-2 inhibitors in patients with HF and T2DM is essential to guide clinical practice. This study aims to comprehensively assess the existing controlled trials on SGLT-2 inhibitor therapy for HF and T2DM patients through a meta-analysis approach, aiming to clarify their efficacy and safety, and ultimately provide more comprehensive and scientific evidence to support the treatment of HF and T2DM patients.2. Methods2.1. Literature search strategyGiven the international and specialized nature of the research, a manual search was conducted across 3 authoritative English databases: Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Web of Science. To ensure the timeliness and capture the latest advancements, the search timeframe was precisely set to cover the past decade, from July 2014 to July 2024. A combination of subject terms and free-text words was used to enhance the sensitivity and specificity of the search. The primary search keywords included “heart failure OR HF,” “Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2 Inhibitors OR SGLT-2 Inhibitors,” “Canagliflozin OR Dapagliflozin OR Empagliflozin OR Luseogliflozin,” and “type 2 diabetes.” All retrieved articles were managed using EndNote 21 software.A systematic literature search was performed to identify studies that explored the mechanisms of SGLT-2 inhibitors in T2DM and their associated effects on cardiovascular and renal outcomes. Studies included in this review were selected based on their relevance to the primary effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors and their contributions to understanding secondary mechanisms such as oxidative stress reduction, endothelial function improvement, and HF protection.[17–19]2.2. Inclusion and exclusion criteriaInclusion criteria: (1) study population: studies explicitly including patients with HFcombined with T2DM as the research subjects. (2) Intervention measures: studies utilizing at least 1 SGLT-2 inhibitor (Canagliflozin, Dapagliflozin, Empagliflozin, or Luseogliflozin) as the intervention. (3) Outcome indicators: studies reporting any of the following outcome indicators: ① efficacy indicators: N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), left ventricular end-diastolic volume index (LVEDVI); Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ); ② survival prognosis indicators: risk of HF hospitalization (HHF), risk of cardiovascular death, risk of all-cause death, risk of composite outcome of HF hospitalization or cardiovascular death; ③ safety indicators: incidence of adverse events. (4) Language limitation: only English literature was included to ensure the accuracy and accessibility of the research information.Exclusion criteria: (1) reviews, conference abstracts, commentary articles, etc. (2) Multiple publications of the same study, which were identified and excluded using the deduplication function of EndNote 21 and manual inspection. (3) Non-randomized controlled trials, case reports, and observational studies. (4) Studies that did not explicitly mention HF combined with T2DM or included patients with other disease states. (5) Animal and in vitro experiments as well as pharmacokinetic studies. (6) Studies with incomplete or unavailable data.2.3. Literature screening and data extractionTwo independent researchers conducted the database search and initial screening process separately, rapidly reviewing the titles and abstracts of all retrieved articles. Based on the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, they preliminarily excluded those that obviously did not meet the conditions. For studies repeatedly published across multiple databases or in different issues in the same journal, the 1 with the most complete and detailed data was preferentially selected to avoid duplicate calculations and analyses. For articles that potentially met the inclusion criteria after the initial screening, both researchers thoroughly read the full text. During this stage, meticulous screening was conducted, strictly adhering to the established inclusion and exclusion criteria. This process required researchers to thoroughly understand the study design, methodology, results, and conclusions of the literature to ensure that the quality of the included studies met analytical requirements. In cases of disagreement during the screening process, a third researcher was invited to join the discussion to jointly resolve the issue, ensuring the objectivity and consistency of the screening results.For the successfully included studies, data extraction was performed. The extracted content included, but was not limited to, the following: authors and publication year of the literature for tracing the research background and source; quality evaluation information such as the use of randomization, blinding, and sample size to assess the scientific rigor and credibility of the study; baseline characteristics of the study population, including age and follow-up duration, for inter-group comparisons; specific intervention protocols and measures for the experimental and control groups to clarify the intervention effects of the study; and relevant cardiac function and prognosis outcome indicators after treatment, such as cardiac function improvement, incidence of cardiovascular events, and incidence of adverse events, as key data for analyzing efficacy and safety.2.4. Quality assessment of literatureThe Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool was employed, utilizing Review Manager 5.4 software to create a risk of bias graph. Studies were evaluated holistically based on the 7 domains of Cochrane Risk of Bias. If all domains were rated as “low risk,” the study was deemed overall as “low risk.” If some domains were rated as “unclear risk” but no “high risk” domains existed, the overall evaluation was “some concerns.” Any study with a “high risk” rating in any domain was deemed “high risk.”2.5. Statistical analysisFor continuous variables and survival data, standardized mean differences and hazard ratios (HR) were adopted as effect size indicators. Data analysis was completed using Review Manager 5.4 and Stata 15.0 statistical software. To present the analysis results more intuitively, the logarithm of the HR (log HR) and its standard error were calculated. Additionally, all effect sizes were expressed with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) to enhance the reliability of the results. When the P-value of the Q test was >.05, indicating no significant heterogeneity among the studies, a fixed-effects model was used to pool the effect sizes for cases with no or low heterogeneity. In cases of moderate-to-high heterogeneity among studies, a random-effects model was employed to combine the data results.3. Results3.1. Literature search results3.1.1. Literature inclusion processPubMed, Web of Science database returned 169 articles, and Library of Congress databases yielded 912, 169, and 71 articles, respectively. Three additional articles were manually identified through supplementary searches on Google Scholar, resulting in an initial total of 1155 articles. After removing duplicates, 1025 articles remained. Following the exclusion of 156 irrelevant articles and further screening of titles and abstracts, 774 articles were discarded, leaving 82 articles for full-text review. Upon reviewing the full texts, articles with incomplete data, inconsistent outcomes, or non-compliant study subjects were excluded, ultimately resulting in the inclusion of 12 articles, as illustrated in Figure 1.Figure 1.Literature inclusion process.3.1.2. General characteristics of included studiesTwelve studies[20–31] were included, encompassing 9509 patients, with 4828 patients in the experimental group (treated with SGLT-2 inhibitors) and 4681 patients in the control group. The average age of the study participants was over 66 years, classifying them as elderly. Among the included studies, empagliflozin was the most commonly used SGLT-2 inhibitor in the experimental group, followed by canagliflozin. The control group received either placebo or standard diabetic therapy.

Quality of literatureThe study by Filippatos et al[22] was identified as high-risk due to the presence of a high-risk in random sequence generation (selection bias), while Anker SD[21] and Petrie MC[24] were classified as medium-risk due to unknown risks in blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias). The remaining 9 studies[20,23,25–31] were deemed low-risk across all 7 dimensions and were considered high-quality, low-risk literature. Therefore, the majority of the included studies were low-risk, indicating a high overall quality of the included literature, as shown in Figure 2.Figure 2.Quality evaluation of included literature.3.2. META-analysis results3.2.1. Efficacy outcomes META-analysis resultsThree studies[20,23,30] reported LVEDVI. With an I² heterogeneity of 0%, a fixed-effects model was chosen. The meta-analysis revealed a combined effect size of mean difference (MD) = -7.25, 95% CI (-9.83, -4.67), Z = 5.51, P < .00001, indicating a statistically significant reduction in LVEDVI in the experimental group compared to that in the control group, as shown in Figure 3.Figure 3.The effect of SGLT-2 inhibitors on the LVEDVI in patients. LVEDVI = left ventricular end-diastolic volume index, SGLT-2 = sodium-glucose cotransporter 2.Three studies[27,29,30] mentioned the BNP marker.

The meta-analysis showed a combined effect size of MD = -36.96, 95% CI (-63.51, -10.41), Z = 2.73, P < .05, indicating a significant decrease in BNP levels in the experimental group compared to the control group, with statistical significance, as shown in Figure 4.Figure 4.The effect of SGLT-2 inhibitors on BNP levels in patients. BNP = brain natriuretic peptide, SGLT-2 = sodium-glucose cotransporter 2.Three studies[21,23,24] reported KCCQ scores. Due to an I² heterogeneity of 100%, a random-effects model was chosen. The meta-analysis yielded a combined effect size of MD = 3.32, 95% CI (3.30, 3.34), Z = 278.41, P < .00001, indicating a significant improvement in KCCQ scores in the experimental group compared to the control group, with statistical significance, as shown in Figure 5.Figure 5.The effect of SGLT-2 inhibitors on patient KCCQ scores. KCCQ = Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire, SGLT-2 = sodium-glucose cotransporter 2.Three studies[23,27,28] reported the NT-proBNP levels.

Prognostic outcomes META-analysis resultsFive studies[21,22,24–26] addressed the time to the first event of cardiovascular death or HHF in patients with HF and T2DM treated with SGLT-2 inhibitors. As there was no heterogeneity among the studies (I² = 0.0%, P = .945), a fixed-effects model was used. The combined HR and 95% CI were 0.77 (0.70, 0.83), indicating a 23% reduction in cardiovascular death or HHF events with SGLT-2 inhibitor treatment (Fig. 7).Figure 7.The effect of SGLT-2 inhibitors on the risk of cardiovascular disease death or hospitalization for heart failure in patients. SGLT-2 = sodium-glucose cotransporter 2.Five studies[21,22,24,25,31] investigated the time to cardiovascular death in patients with HF and T2DM treated with SGLT-2 inhibitors. Moderate heterogeneity was observed (I² = 47.6%, P = .106), prompting the use of a random-effects model. The combined HR and 95% CI were 0.81 (0.68, 0.97), indicating a 19% reduction in cardiovascular death events with SGLT-2 inhibitor treatment, as shown in Figure 8.Figure 8.Impact of SGLT-2 inhibitors on the risk of cardiovascular disease mortality in patients. SGLT-2 = sodium-glucose cotransporter 2.Four studies[22,24,26,31] examined the time to all-cause mortality in patients with HF and T2DM treated with SGLT-2 inhibitors. Mild heterogeneity was present (I² = 34.8%, P = .203), necessitating the use of a random-effects model. The combined HR and 95% CI were 0.91 (0.75, 1.10), indicating a 9% reduction in all-cause mortality events with SGLT-2 inhibitor treatment (Fig. 9).Figure 9.Impact of SGLT-2 inhibitors on the risk of all-cause mortality in patients.

Heterogeneity analysis showed I² = 0%; therefore, the fixed-effects model was selected. The results of the meta-analysis showed that the combined effect size OR = 0.78, 95% CI (0.69, 0.88), Z = 6.55, P < .00001, indicating that the incidence of adverse reactions in the experimental group was significantly lower than that in the control group, with statistical significance, as shown in Figure 10.Figure 10.Impact of SGLT-2 inhibitors on the incidence of adverse reactions in patients. SGLT-2 = sodium-glucose cotransporter 2.4. DiscussionSGLT-2 inhibitors, or sodium-dependent glucose transporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, are a new type of hypoglycemic drug. Their successful development has provided a new approach for the treatment of diabetes and has become a research hotspot for hypoglycemic drugs.[32,33] SGLT-2 is the primary transporter responsible for the reabsorption of glucose filtered by renal tubules. It is distributed in the S1 segment of the proximal renal tubules and completes the reabsorption of approximately 90% of the glucose in the glomerular filtrate.[34] SGLT-2 inhibitors can selectively inhibit SGLT-2 receptors and reduce glucose reabsorption in the proximal renal tubules.[35] By inhibiting SGLT-2 receptors, SGLT-2 inhibitors can lower the renal threshold for glucose and allow glucose that would otherwise be reabsorbed in the kidneys to be excreted in urine, thereby increasing urinary glucose excretion and reducing blood glucose levels.[36,37] With the increase in urinary glucose excretion, the glucose concentration in the blood gradually decreases, achieving a hypoglycemic effect. This hypoglycemic method does not depend on insulin secretion or sensitivity; therefore, it is also effective in diabetic patients with insulin resistance.[38,39] Currently, various SGLT-2 inhibitors have been launched globally, such as dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, and canagliflozin. Among them, dapagliflozin has been approved by the China Food and Drug Administration and is available in China.Heart failure complicated by T2DM is a complex clinical condition that requires comprehensive consideration of multiple factors in its treatment. Among the included literature, 4 indicators frequently appeared: LVEDVI, BNP, KCCQ, and NT-proBNP. These 4 indicators comprehensively evaluate the therapeutic effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors in patients with HF complicated by T2DM from the aspects of cardiac function and quality of life. The results of this meta-analysis showed that the experimental group treated with SGLT-2 inhibitors demonstrated significantly better outcomes than the control group in terms of LVEDVI, BNP, KCCQ, and NT-proBNP, indicating that SGLT-2 inhibitors can be an effective treatment for patients with HF complicated by T2DM. LVEDVI is an indicator that measures the left ventricular volume at the end of diastole, reflecting cardiac diastolic function.[40] SGLT-2 inhibitors promote urinary glucose excretion and reduce blood volume, thereby decreasing cardiac preload, contributing to improved ventricular diastolic function, and subsequently, reducing LVEDVI. Furthermore, SGLT-2 inhibitors may also enhance cardiac efficiency by improving energy metabolism in cardiomyocytes, further reducing the end-diastolic ventricular volume.[41] BNP and NT-proBNP are peptide hormones secreted by the heart, are closely related to increased cardiac volume and pressure load, and serve as important biomarkers for HF diagnosis and prognosis assessment.[42] The significant efficacy of SGLT-2 inhibitors in HF treatment may be partially attributed to their regulation of BNP and NT-proBNP levels. Although the specific mechanisms are not fully understood, SGLT-2 inhibitors may reduce the secretion of BNP and NT-proBNP by improving cardiac function and decreasing cardiac load. Additionally, SGLT-2 inhibitors may further lower BNP and NT-proBNP levels by inhibiting myocardial fibrosis and improving cardiac remodeling.[43] The KCCQ is a crucial tool for assessing the quality of life in HF patients, encompassing dimensions such as symptom assessment and functional status. The significant improvement in KCCQ scores with SGLT-2 inhibitors suggests that these drugs not only enhance cardiac function but also improve patients’ quality of life.[44] This may be related to the role of SGLT-2 inhibitors in reducing HF symptoms, improving exercise tolerance, and decreasing rehospitalization rates.[45] Studies have also indicated that SGLT-2 inhibitors may indirectly enhance patients’ quality of life by improving their psychological state, such as by reducing anxiety and depression.[46]Heart failure and T2DM are significant contributors to all-cause mortality. Heart failure affects at least 26 million people globally, with an increasing prevalence every year.[47] A study of HF patients with T2DM revealed that hypoglycemic events are a risk factor for cardiovascular adverse events and increased all-cause mortality.[48] In the CHARM trial, even after adjusting for multiple covariates, diabetes remained an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality in HF patients.[49] Therefore, patients with HF complicated with T2DM face a higher risk of cardiovascular death and all-cause mortality, and understanding the impact of SGLT-2 inhibitors on patient prognosis is crucial for improving their quality of life. The combined results of this meta-analysis indicated that the experimental group treated with SGLT-2 inhibitors experienced a 23% reduced risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for HF, a 19% reduced risk of cardiovascular death, and a 9% reduced risk of all-cause mortality. Multiple large randomized controlled trials, including EMPA-REG OUTCOME,[50] NVAS,[51] and CLARE-TIMI 58,[52] have confirmed the significant effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors in reducing the risks of cardiovascular death, HF hospitalization, and all-cause mortality. Heart failure-specific trials, such as DAPA-HF[53] and EMPEROR-Reduced,[54] have also demonstrated that SGLT-2 inhibitors significantly reduce the risks of cardiovascular death and hospitalization in HF patients. Through mechanisms including glucose-lowering, cardiac function improvement, and anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects, SGLT-2 inhibitors reduce cardiovascular events and thereby improve patient prognosis. The results of this meta-analysis showed that the incidence of adverse reactions in the experimental group was significantly lower than that in the control group. SGLT-2 inhibitors for the treatment of HF complicated by T2DM significantly reduce the occurrence of adverse reactions, such as infections, fractures, diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperkalemia, and liver dysfunction, indicating a high level of safety.[55,56] The long-term use of SGLT-2 inhibitors exhibits good tolerability and a low rate of adverse reactions, allowing patients to adhere to treatment with greater peace of mind. As clinical research continues to deepen and drug applications become more widespread, the position of SGLT-2 inhibitors in the management of HF complicated by T2DM will be further consolidated, providing more potent treatment options for clinicians and patients.While the primary mechanism of action of SGLT-2 inhibitors is well understood, recent studies[6,7,57] have expanded our understanding of their multifactorial effects. These studies suggest that beyond their glucose-lowering action, SGLT-2 inhibitors may reduce oxidative stress and improve endothelial function, which could explain their cardiovascular and renal benefits. However, further investigation is required to fully elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects, particularly in populations with cardiovascular comorbidities and chronic kidney disease.This study provides comprehensive evidence supporting the efficacy and safety profile of SGLT-2 inhibitors in patients with HF complicated by T2DM. These findings highlight their potential to reduce cardiovascular events, improve HF symptoms, and enhance quality of life in this high-risk population. These results contribute to the growing body of knowledge on the multifaceted benefits of SGLT-2 inhibitors, underscoring their role not only as effective hypoglycemic agents but also as essential cardiovascular and renal protectors in patients with both HF and T2DM. In the context of future medical developments, the results of this meta-analysis can guide clinicians in optimizing treatment regimens for patients with the dual burden of HF and T2DM. The evidence here supports the broader implementation of SGLT-2 inhibitors in clinical practice, especially as adjunctive therapy for improving cardiac and metabolic outcomes. Moreover, this study strengthens the need for further research on the long-term effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors, particularly regarding their impact on HF progression and diabetic complications over extended treatment periods. However, several important gaps remain in the current evidence, limiting the full potential of SGLT-2 inhibitors in clinical practice. Future studies should address the the limitations as study design and heterogeneity: while meta-analysis synthesizes results from multiple randomized controlled trials, significant heterogeneity in study designs, population demographics, and intervention protocols poses a challenge to generalizability. More uniform study designs with consistent endpoints would help to consolidate this evidence.Although SGLT-2 inhibitors have shown strong short-term efficacy, data on their long-term effects, especially in the context of older populations with multiple comorbidities, are still lacking. Extended follow-up periods are necessary to evaluate the sustained benefits and potential risks, such as the impact on kidney function or cardiovascular outcomes over time. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to compare the efficacy of different SGLT-2 inhibitors in patients with HF and diabetes. This leaves a gap in the understanding of whether 1 agent might be more effective or safer than others in this specific population. While this study emphasizes the efficacy of SGLT-2 inhibitors as monotherapy, there is a pressing need to investigate the optimal combination of SGLT-2 inhibitors with other HF medications (such as ACE inhibitors, β-blockers, and aldosterone antagonists). This could further improve outcomes and enhance individualized treatment of patients with multiple health challenges. The majority of studies included in this meta-analysis focused on older, predominantly male, populations. Future research should aim to include a broader demographic to better understand the potential benefits and risks of SGLT-2 inhibitors in different age groups, genders, and ethnic backgrounds.5. ConclusionThis study, through a systematic meta-analysis, synthesized data from multiple high-quality research studies, revealing the significant efficacy and good safety profile of SGLT-2 inhibitors in patients with HF complicated by T2DM. However, this study has several limitations. Firstly, the relatively small number of studies included, coupled with significant variations in study follow-up durations, may have impacted the interpretation of the results. Secondly, by focusing primarily on English-language literature, this study potentially overlooked important research published in other languages, limiting the comprehensiveness of the findings. Thirdly, further investigation is needed to explore the specific efficacy differences among different SGLT-2 inhibitors and potential drug–drug interactions. Future research should strive to conduct larger-scale, multicenter, randomized controlled trials to more accurately assess the efficacy and safety of SGLT-2 inhibitors in patients with various types of HF and T2DM. Additionally, exploring the combined use of SGLT-2 inhibitors with other HF treatments (such as ACEI/ARBs, β-blockers, and aldosterone receptor antagonists) is essential for optimizing treatment regimens. The findings of this meta-analysis strongly support the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors in patients with HF and T2DM, demonstrating significant reductions in mortality, hospitalization for HF, and improvement in quality of life. However, further research is needed to address these limitations, particularly in terms of long-term safety, comparative efficacy, and combination therapy approaches. Future investigations should aim to fill these gaps and refine treatment protocols, ultimately contributing to the evolving landscape of HF and diabetes management. With more comprehensive data, SGLT-2 inhibitors have the potential to become the cornerstone of therapeutic strategies in this patient population.Author contributionsConceptualization: Xinliang Yao, Xueli Lu.Data curation: Xinliang Yao, Han Zhang, Xueli Lu.Formal analysis: Xinliang Yao, Han Zhang, Xueli Lu.Investigation: Xinliang Yao, Xueli Lu.Methodology: Xinliang Yao, Xueli Lu.Resources: Xueli Lu.Software: Xinliang Yao, Han Zhang, Xueli Lu.Supervision: Xinliang Yao.Validation: Xinliang Yao, Han Zhang.Visualization: Xinliang Yao, Han Zhang.Writing – original draft: Xinliang Yao, Han Zhang, Xueli Lu.Writing – review & editing: Xinliang Yao, Xueli Lu."}

In recent years, cilostazol has received increasing research attention. We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of cilostazol on the outcome of ISR after carotid stenting.MethodsA meta-analysis was carried out to identify the clinical trials that had been published up to 22 December 2024. The databases PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, CNKI and Wanfang have all been queried. The study population was composed of patients with stent carotid heart disease who were receiving cilostazol. Results included in-stent-restenosis, ischemic stroke and all-cause mortality. Publications were reviewed according to the Cochrane Handbook and the guidelines set out in the Preferred Reporting Project for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA 2020). The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the Revised Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for randomized trials (RoB 2.0) and the Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I).ResultsThis study was registered with INPLASY (number INPLASY202510004). A total of 1975 patients were included in 4 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 5 non-RCTs. A statistically significant reduction in ISR was observed for antiplatelet regimens including cilostazol compared to the control group (OR = 0.27, 95%CI: 0.13 ~ 0.54, P<0.01, I2 = 30%). Subgroup analysis revealed this finding was primarily driven by non-randomized controlled trials (non-RCTs), demonstrating a consistent effect (OR = 0.17, 95%CI: 0.08 ~ 0.39, P<0.01, I2 = 0%). For other primary end events, no significant differences were noted in the incidence of ischemic stroke (OR = 0.83, 95%CI: 0.50 ~ 1.39, P = 0.49, I2 = 0%) or all cause death (OR = 0.53, 95%CI: 0.26 ~ 1.05, P = 0.07, I2 = 0%). The certainty of evidence for the ISR outcome was rated as low.ConclusionsCilostazol was associated with less postoperative carotid stent restenosis, with no statistically significant difference in ischemic stroke and all-cause mortality.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13019-025-03522-7.", "body": "IntroductionCarotid artery disease is a common vascular disease and a major cause of ischemic stroke [1]. Currently, carotid artery stenting (CAS) is a widely used clinical treatment for carotid artery disease with minimal invasiveness and a low incidence of complications. However, studies have shown that in-stent restenosis (ISR) occurs in over 10% of patients after CAS surgery [2]. ISR is characterized by the recurrence of blood vessel stenosis within the stent or both ends of the stent with a diameter of at least 5 mm and a maximum contraction velocity of at least 1.75 m/s as determined by Doppler ultrasound. The prevalence of ISR has been associated with an increased risk of stroke [3] and worsening of patients’ quality of life. Despite the implementation of antiplatelet therapy to prevent ISR in patients treated with a stent implant, complications such as restenosis and stroke continue to occur. Previous studies have shown that severe ISR (stenosis greater than 70%) may occur in some patients within two years of carotid stenting, highlighting the need to develop more effective antithrombotic treatment options [4]– [5].Cilostazol is a 2-hydroxyquinolone derivative that selectively inhibits the activity of phosphodiesterase, thereby increasing the level of cyclic adenosine phosphate and inhibiting the release of 5-hydroxytryptamine and adenosine diphosphate from platelets. This leads to a vasodilating and antiplatelet effect [6]. In addition, cilostazol has been shown to have a protective effect on vascular endothelial function and act as an anticoagulant, alleviating neurological symptoms and cerebral edema after ischemia and protecting brain function [7]. The available evidence lists cilostazol as a secondary drug. Line agent after aspirin and clopidogrel treatment [8]– [9]. In addition, studies have highlighted the superiority of this drug in the secondary prevention of stroke and prevention of hemorrhagic events compared to other antiplatelet agents [10]. There was a meta-analysis that showed a reduction in ISR in CAS patients treated with cilostazol [11]. However, the study population was limited to Japan and a limited number of randomized controlled trials were lacking. Consequently, this systematic review was conducted to collect, analyze and provide all relevant data on the protective effects of cilostazol-containing regimens on adverse cardiovascular events and postoperative ISR, with the aim of guiding the prevention of ISR after CAS.MethodsThe meta-analysis was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [12]. The protocol has been registered in the International Platform of Registered Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols database (Inplasy protocol: INPLASY202510004) and is fully available on Inplasy.com (https://inplasy.com/inplasy-2025-1-0004/). Ethical approval was not required for this study.Search strategyA comprehensive electronic search of the literature was conducted by three researchers (Jing Sun, Duo Wang and Yue Zhao). Electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, CNKI and Wanfang) were systematically searched for relevant studies since their inception up to 22 December 2024. The search strategy of the literature was shown in the supplement (Supplementary file Table S1).Study selection criteriaStudies included in this meta-analysis were required to meet the following criteria. The inclusion criteria are as follows: (1) Patients after carotid artery stenting; (2) The intervention group received cilostazol and the control group received other antiplatelet agents; (3) Outcome measures included stent restenosis, incidence of ischemic stroke, and all-cause mortality; (4) Randomized controlled trials and relevant clinical studies. The exclusion criteria excluded the following studies: (1) non-clinical trials, such as reviews, letters, meta-analyses; (2) The results of patients in the cilostazol group could not be extracted. No specific language restrictions were applied to the included studies.Data extractionThree authors carried out data extraction independently (Jing Sun, Duo Wang and Yue Zhao), using established standard data collection tables. The data extracted included first author name, year of publication, subject characteristics, cilostazol dose, and the primary and secondary outcomes described above.Assessment of trial qualityTwo independent reviewers performed study selection and data extraction using a pre-defined standardized protocol, strictly adhering to pre-specified inclusion and exclusion criteria. Relevant data were systematically collected following dual-review verification. Funnel plots were employed to assess potential publication bias among the included eligible studies. The methodological quality of the trials was assessed using the Revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials (RoB 2.0) and the Risk of Bias In Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I) [13]– [14], which was shown in the supplement (Supplementary file Figure S1-2).\nFig. 1Selection process for studies included in the meta-analysis\n\nFig. 2Forest map of in-stent restenosis between cilostazol group and control group\nData synthesis and analysisThe meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan 5.4. Data that met the criteria for homogeneity (P > 0.10 and I²≤50%) as determined by the heterogeneity test were subjected to meta-analysis using the fixed-effect model. In instances where the aforementioned homogeneity criteria were not met (P ≤ 0.10 or I2 > 50%), and the presence of heterogeneity could not be discounted, the random-effect model was employed to consolidate the effects [15]. Due to the inconsistency of the experiment types included in the studies, we considered using subgroup groupings to express the results. The estimates are expressed as odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.ResultsEligible studiesThe flow chart provides a summary of the process for identifying and selecting studies for review (Fig. 1). A total of 2689 related literatures were retrieved, of which 986 were excluded due to duplication. Furthermore, 1652 studies were excluded after a preliminary assessment of the titles and abstracts. The remaining 51 studies were subjected to a more comprehensive evaluation through a thorough reading of the full texts. Data from nine trials evaluate the effects of cilostazol on outcomes such as in-stent restenosis after carotid artery stenting in the final analysis.General characteristic of studies and outcomesA total of 1975 patients were included in 4 randomized controlled trials [16–19] and 5 non-RCTs [20–24]. Seven trials [16]– [17, 20–24] were published in English and other two trials [18]– [19] were published in Chinese. The detailed characteristics of the included trials are presented in Table 1. All of the study population received carotid stent therapy and postoperative treatment with cilostazol or other antiplatelet agents. For antiplatelet regimens that include cilostazol compared to other antiplatelet therapies, there was significant difference in ISR(OR = 0.27, 95%CI: 0.13 ~ 0.54, P<0.01, I2 = 30%) (Fig. 2). But in the subgroup analysis, this difference was mainly due to the non-RCT results(OR = 0.17, 95%CI: 0.08 ~ 0.39, P<0.01, I2 = 0%), and the results of two randomized controlled trials showed no statistical difference in the occurrence of ISR between the two groups(OR = 0.38, 95%CI: 0.09 ~ 1.53, P = 0.17, I2 = 53%). To better describe the ISR results, relative risk was used in the expression, and the results were similar to those described above (Supplementary file Figure S3). With regard to adverse events, there was no notable discrepancy in the incidence of ischemic stroke (Fig. 3) (OR = 0.83, 95%CI: 0.50 ~ 1.39, P = 0.49, I2 = 0%) or all cause death (Fig. 4) (OR = 0.53, 95%CI: 0.26 ~ 1.05, P = 0.07, I2 = 0%). In terms of study type, we also conducted subgroup analysis, and the result was the same (P > 0.05).\nTable 1Design and outcomes of the studies included in the Meta-AnalysisNumAuthor/ YearDesignIntervention assignmentsParticipantsOutcomeInterventionControlSample, nMean ageMale(%)Patients(I/C)Follow up1Jin/2009 [19]RCTCil 200 mg/d + Asp 100 mg/dAsp + Clo1963.368.413/62 weeksIR2Kato/2012 [20]non-RCTCil 200 mg/d + other APNoncilostazol957388.429/6612 monthsISR3Miyazaki/2015 [22]non-RCTCil 100-200 mg/d + other APNoncilostazol22972.477.793/13612 monthsISR4Takayama/2012 [23]non-RCTCil 200 mg/d + Asp 100 mg/dAspi + Clo/Tic6272.987.130/323–6 monthsISR5Takigawa/2010 [24]non-RCTCil 200 mg/d + Asp 100 mg/dAsp and Tic/Clo9769.685.627/7012 monthsISR; IR6Tsutsumi/2013 [17]RCTCil 200 mg/d + Asp 100 mg/dThienopyridine + Asp19775.782.797/10012 monthsISR; IR; All cause death7Yamagami/2012 [21]non-RCTCil 100-200 mg/d + other APNoncilostazol55370.186.4207/34630 monthsISR; IR; All cause death8Yamagami/2024 [16]RCTCil 100-200 mg/d + other APNoncilostazol63169.988.4325/3062 yearsISR; IR; All cause death9Yang/2019 [18]RCTCil 200 mg + asp + cloAsp + Clo6055.661.731/296 monthsIRAP = Antiplatelet therapy, Asp = aspirin, Cil = cilostazol, Clo = clopidogre, I/C = Intervention group/ Control group, IR = Ischemic stroke, ISR = in-stent restenosis, Tic = ticlopidine\n\nFig. 3Forest map of ischemic stroke between cilostazol group and control group\n\nFig. 4Forest map of all cause death between cilostazol group and control group\nBias and assessment of trials qualityThe RevMan software is used to see how a single study affects the overall result for each outcome. We used a funnel plot to test for publication bias in included studies and found that the bias was small (Supplementary file Figure S4). The randomized controlled trials included in this analysis were evaluated using RoB 2.0 and showed medium-high quality. Non-randomized controlled trials were evaluated using ROBINS-I, and the results were mostly of moderate quality. The results of the risk of bias assessment of these trials are summarized in the Supplementary file Figure S1-2. This shows that the research conclusions in this paper are reliable. This study assessed research certainty according to the criteria of the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) Guidelines Working Group [25]. According to the corresponding evaluation criteria, the evidence level was classified (divided into 4 categories: high, moderate, low and very low) [26]. Certainty of evidence for ISR was low (Supplement file Table S2).Furthermore, studies with relatively complete data were selected for sub-analysis [16]– [17, 21–23] and the basic characteristics of patients who received cilostazol and those who did not were compared. Data type is number of people, we performed chi-square test. A pooled sub-analysis of these studies revealed statistical differences between hyperlipidemia and open cell stents (P < 0.05, Table 2).\nTable 2Comparison between Cilostazol-Treated and noncilostazol patients with adequate dataCilostazol(n = 752)Noncilostazol(n = 920)\nP\nMale gender(N)6528050.628Smoking(N)2753350.947Diabetes mellitus(N)2883680.478Hypertension(N)5697150.323Dyslipidemia(N)4085020.021Symptomatic carotid stenosis(N)3914660.585Open-cell stents(N)343511< 0.01\nDiscussionThis study comprehensively analyzed the clinical impact of cilostazol on patients with CAS after stenting, including the incidence of ISR, stroke, and mortality. The following conclusions were drawn: First, patients treated with cilostazol either as monotherapy or in combination with other antiplatelet agents showed a reduction in ISR within 12 months after CAS. This protective effect can offset the negative effects of different types of stents on ISR. Second, cilostazol did not reduce the risk of ischemic stroke in patients after CAS surgery. In addition, the study found that cilostazol did not increase the risk of all-cause death in patients after CAS and showed a downward trend compared to alternative antiplatelet agents. In contrast to previous meta-analyses, this study augmented the sample size and incorporated the most recent high-quality RCT studies. The findings were more compelling and possessed guiding significance for clinical practice.Carotid artery stenting (CAS) is the primary treatment for stenosis or occlusion of the carotid artery. Intima-media thickness (IMT) events mainly occur within 1 year after CAS and are mainly due to arterial elastic retraction, thrombosis, intimal hyperplasia and arterial wall remodeling [27]. Cilostazol has been shown to be an effective preventative measure against the occurrence of ISR. Among the nine studies included in this meta-analysis, six studies [16, 20–24] supported this conclusion. Two studies [18]– [19] did not report in-stent restenosis (ISR) as an outcome, while another study [28] indicated that although no significant difference was observed between the cilostazol group and the control group, a downward trend in ISR risk was evident. The protective effect of cilostazol can be achieved mainly through the following mechanisms: (1) Inhibition of intimal proliferation. Intimal hyperplasia is one of the core mechanisms of ISR [29]. Stent implantation has been demonstrated to cause damage to the vascular endothelium, with platelets adhering to the injured site and releasing the related components of platelet α particles, such as the chemotactic and mitotic factors of vascular smooth muscle cells, such as PDGF [2]. These factors have been shown to promote intimal hyperplasia and vascular lumen stenosis. This, in turn, has been shown to increase the risk of ISR [30]. In addition, cilostazol has been shown to upregulate tumor suppressor genes P53, P21 and hepatocyte growth factor by affecting cAMP levels [30]– [31]. The increase in p53 protein can block the cell cycle and induce smooth muscle cell apoptosis, thereby increasing the anti-proliferation effect of cells. (2) Inhibiting inflammatory response. The invasion of inflammatory cells into damaged intima is facilitated by endothelial cell adhesion molecules, and the proliferation of newborn intima is promoted by these molecules. Cilostazol has been shown to downregulate endothelial cell adhesion molecules [32]. Previous studies have shown that cilostazol can inhibit the inflammatory response after CAS by affecting monocyte function [33]. (3) Inhibition of platelet aggregation in the thrombus. The formation of local microthrombi after CAS is one of the pathogeneses of ISR. Cilostazol has been shown to effectively inhibit platelet aggregation induced by various stimuli, including adenosine diphosphate, collagen, arachidonic acid, epinephrine and thrombin. In addition, it has been observed to inhibit platelet aggregation induced by shear stress, contributing to the inhibition of platelet aggregation and micro-emboli formation in the carotid arteries of patients [34]. In addition, recent evidence suggests that cilostazol plays a role in inhibiting multidrug-resistant protein 4 (MRP4) [35] by actively transporting cyclic nucleotides, including cAMP and cGMP, thereby promoting platelet aggregation [36]. Cilostazol has been shown to reduce aspirin-induced high expression of MRP4 in platelets, thereby exerting a synergistic antiplatelet effect. A study included in this meta-analysis [18] compared the platelet aggregation rate, hematopoietic volume and fibrinogen of patients after CAS surgery. The results showed that the cilostazol group was significantly lower than the control group, suggesting the accurate anti-platelet effect of cilostazol in patients after CAS surgery.In the course of this meta-analysis, studies were selected for sub-analysis on the basis of the completeness of their data [16]– [17, 21–23]. It was found that the prevalence of hyperlipidemia was significantly higher in the cilostazol group than in the control group. This finding is in contrast to the results of previous studies, which suggested that hyperlipidemia was one of the risk factors for ISR after CAS [7]. However, the results of this study suggest that the incidence of ISR in the cilostazol group is still significantly lower than in the control group, which may be due to the hypolipidemic effect of cilostazol. The results of clinical trials have confirmed that cilostazol can increase cyclic adenosine phosphate and phosphorylated lipase through activation of protein kinase A, reduce the secretion of very low-density lipoprotein, increase high-density lipoprotein in the body, and reduce triglyceride levels in the body [37]. Furthermore, previous studies have suggested that differences in stent design appear to be associated with different incidences of restenosis. Despite the lack of data from the studies included in this meta-analysis, it was observed that closed cell stent use was more common in patients receiving cilostazol, which concomitantly resulted in a lower incidence of ISR. However, it should be noted that previous studies have shown that open-cell scaffolds appear to have a lower incidence of restenosis than closed-cell scaffolds [38]. The presence of more metal components in closed cell stents compared to open cell stents, as well as their poorer compliance, has been shown to result in localized stress concentration at the turn or bifurcation of blood vessels. This, in turn, has been shown to cause excessive pressure on the walls of blood vessels, leading to inflammation and intimal hyperplasia. This has been shown to increase the risk of ISR [5]. However, the results of this study may suggest that the positive effects of cilostazol may outweigh the negative effects of blocking cell scaffolds.The safety profile of cilostazol, encompassing adverse events and bleeding risks in combination therapies, merits thorough scrutiny. Common non-hemorrhagic adverse reactions, such as headache and dyspnea attributable to its phosphodiesterase-inhibitory effects on vascular smooth muscle and respiratory pathways [39] were documented in individual investigations but not systematically appraised in this meta-analysis owing to heterogeneous reporting methodologies (such as divergent definitions and documentation thresholds), with their impact on real-world patient adherence during long-term administration remaining underexplored. Regarding bleeding risks, cilostazol-based dual antiplatelet therapy (such as in conjunction with aspirin or clopidogrel) for conditions such as peripheral artery disease or coronary stenting may entail a comparable or marginally reduced major bleeding risk relative to conventional regimens, likely due to its mechanistic inhibition of cyclic AMP degradation without direct platelet receptor blockade; however, data on triple therapy are scarce and were not evaluated herein, given the absence of such studies in this meta-analysis and limited reporting of bleeding outcomes. The findings revealed no statistically significant intergroup disparity in ischemic stroke risk: investigations like SPACE5 [5] and EVA-3 S [40] demonstrated no association between intracranial stenosis recurrence (ISR) and stroke incidence, while Toyoda [41] reported that cilostazol-based dual therapy outperformed monotherapy in preventing high-risk ischemic stroke recurrence, though its benefits in extracranial stenosis vascular event prevention remained equivocal in subgroup analysis. Notably, this meta-analysis demonstrated no elevated 2-year mortality risk with cilostazol, and studies documenting bleeding events [16–21] confirmed no excess bleeding risk in the cilostazol group, underscoring its favorable safety profile while concurrently highlighting the imperative for future research on triple therapy and long-term treatment adherence impacts.The present study is subject to the following limitations. First, all the included studies were conducted in Asian countries, and this geographic restriction may limit the generalizability of our findings due to potential differences in genetic profiles, lifestyle factors, and healthcare practices between Asian and non-Asian populations. Second, the overall sample size remains modest, and the available data are limited by heterogeneous follow-up durations across studies, which may affect the precision of long-term outcome assessments. These limitations highlight the need for future large-scale, multicenter studies involving diverse populations to validate our results and expand their applicability. Thirdly, the studies included in this study comprise retrospective cohort studies and randomized controlled studies, some of which are of poor quality, employ different types of stents in different populations, and potentially exhibit differences in the efficacy of antiplatelet drugs, suggesting a possibility of bias. Nevertheless, we were able to identify directions and areas for further research. For instance, further research could entail the conduct of studies on non-Asian populations. In addition, comparative studies may be conducted to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of cilostazol in conjunction with other antiplatelet agents, particularly newer antiplatelet agents such as ticagrelor. Although Meta can be used to provide indirect evidence for the protective effect of cilostazol in postoperative CAS surgery, further randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes are needed.ConclusionCilostazol has been demonstrated to be associated with a reduced incidence of postoperative stent restenosis in carotid artery stents, with no statistically significant difference observed in terms of ischemic stroke and all-cause death.Electronic supplementary materialBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material.\nSupplementary Material 1"}

A total of 19 studies with 2822 participants were included. Eligible RCTs assessed the impact of HBCR on ACS patients, comparing it with hospital-based CR or usual care. The primary outcome was QoL, with secondary outcomes including cardiovascular capacity, cardiovascular disease risk factors, and rehospitalization rates. Statistical analysis was conducted using a random-effects model in R Statistic.ResultsHBCR improves QoL compared to all comparators (hospital-based CR and usual care) (SMD 0.17, 95 % CI 0.00 to 0.33). HBCR was equally effective as hospital-based CR in enhancing QoL, peak VO2, 6-min walk distance (6 MWD), lipid profiles, and blood pressure. Compared to usual care, HBCR significantly improved QoL (SMD 0.29, 95 % CI 0.11 to 0.46) and HDL-cholesterol level (SMD 0.18, 95 % CI 0.02 to 0.34), while reducing triglyceride level more effectively (SMD −0.34, 95 % CI −0.57 to −0.11). However, no significant differences were observed between HBCR and usual care in terms of peak VO2, rehospitalization rates, LDL-cholesterol, total cholesterol, or blood pressure.ConclusionsHBCR significantly improves QoL and is equally effective as hospital-based CR across all measured outcomes. Compared to usual care, HBCR leads to significant improvements in specific aspects of QoL as a primary outcome, as well as in HDL-cholesterol and triglyceride levels. However, its impact on other outcomes, such as peak VO2, LDL-cholesterol, total cholesterol, and blood pressure, is not consistently significant.", "body": "1IntroductionCardiovascular diseases are still the leading cause of death globally. In 2019, deaths from cardiovascular disease reached 17.9 million in 2021, representing 30 % of deaths caused worldwide. Coronary heart disease caused 9 million deaths globally [1]. In low- to middle-income countries, >75 % of deaths are related to cardiovascular diseases [2]. The Global Burden Disease states that deaths from ischemic cardiovascular disease in low- and middle-income countries accounted for 13.4 % of all death cases [2]. The acute spectrum of ischemic cardiovascular disease is acute coronary syndrome (ACS), which still exerts a substantial burden on patients and their families.Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is a crucial program for individuals grappling with cardiovascular diseases and is recommended by the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) [3]. CR helps patients achieve better functional capacity and quality of life (QoL) and lower risk for myocardial infarction, hospitalization, and health costs [4]. However, the limited implementation of CR and low participation rates in hospitals—often averaging only 20–30 % of eligible patients—can be improved by transitioning the second phase of the CR program to the patient's environment as home-based cardiac rehabilitation (HBCR) [5]. The HBCR incurs lower costs than hospital-based CR. Patients undergoing HBCR experience cost efficiency because they do not need transportation and hospital costs [5].Studies show that participation rates in HBCR can exceed 60–80 %, significantly higher than those for hospital-based programs. HBCR has been demonstrated to increase patient participation, program completion, and long-term compliance [[6], [7], [8]]. Additionally, HBCR is associated with greater reductions in cardiovascular disease risk factors, improved QoL, and enhanced exercise capacity compared to usual care in patients who have undergone coronary artery bypass grafting [9]. It also improves peak maximal oxygen consumption (VO2) in patients with myocardial infarction, those who have had percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and heart transplant recipients [10]. Furthermore, HBCR is linked to a lower risk of all-cause rehospitalizations, decreased mortality [11] and fewer adverse events [12].However, there are still limited systematic reviews (SRs) comparing the effectiveness of HBCR with other treatments after hospitalization, specifically looking at both hospital-based CR and usual care together. The importance of SRs on HBCR compared to hospital-based CR and usual care cannot be overstated, particularly for patients with ACS. Despite several studies evaluating HBCR's effectiveness in this population, the evidence remains inconclusive. The diversity of HBCR interventions complicates the identification of the most effective implementation strategies. Most existing SRs have primarily focused on the safety of HBCR in the general heart disease population [12] or on patients undergoing PCI [13]. This focus has created a critical gap in understanding HBCR's impact on clinical outcomes and cardiovascular disease risk factors specifically in ACS patients. Previous reviews have compared HBCR with only one group—either hospital-based CR or usual care—making the comparisons between these two groups unclear.This study aims to compare the outcomes of HBCR with hospital-based CR and usual care to evaluate the effectiveness of HBCR. The selected outcomes focus on the secondary prevention goals of CR program, including improving QoL, cardiovascular capacity, and reducing mortality and rehospitalization rates—key indicators of treatment success. Additionally, we include lipid profiles and blood pressure as intermediate outcomes, reflecting the success of target behaviors such as exercise, diet, and medication adherence.Lipid levels, particularly LDL-cholesterol, are strongly associated with the recurrence of ACS [14]. Similarly, hypertension can also increase the risk of recurrence [15,16]. While lipid-lowering therapy plays a crucial role, lifestyle modifications—such as diet, exercise, and adherence education—are core components of CR and also contribute to lipid improvements [[17], [18], [19], [20], [21]]. By including lipid profiles and blood pressure as secondary outcomes, we aim to assess CR's broader impact on reducing cardiovascular disease risk factors, in addition to preventing the recurrence of ACS. This approach underscores the potential benefits of combining medical treatment with lifestyle changes for better long-term outcomes.2MethodsThis systematic literature review and meta-analysis were conducted following the preferred reporting items for SRs and meta-analyses (PRISMA) checklist [22]. This study has been registered in PROSPERO with ID CRD42023402527.2.1Eligibility criteriaStudies were included if they were RCTs that analyzed patients aged 18 years or older, who were hospitalized for ACS and received HBCR during the outpatient period. Only studies that compared HBCR with hospital-based CR or usual care were included. To qualify, studies had to report on at least one primary outcome. Primary outcomes included patient-related measures during follow-up periods, such as HRQoL, cardiovascular capacity assessed by peak VO2, the 6-min walk distance (6 MWD), and cardiovascular disease risk factors for recurrent ACS and rehospitalization rates. Studies focusing on children or patients hospitalized for cardiovascular diseases other than ACS were excluded from this review.2.2Search strategy and selection studiesThe literature search was conducted in eight databases including Medline, CINAHL, ProQuest, Cochrane Library, Clinical Key, PubMed, Embase, and ClinicalTrial.gov to extract relevant studies published up to June 2023. The search used a Medical Subject Heading and an entree of keywords representing population (P), intervention (I), comparison (C), and outcome (O). The search combination was “Cardiovascular Rehabilitations” AND Home Care” AND “Syndromes, Acute Coronary.” Rayyan software was employed for the management of study selection.The screening was conducted independently by two authors. Two independent reviewers (EM and MHR) screened titles and abstracts for inclusion. Studies were selected based on preplanned criteria. First, titles and abstracts were screened and classified as “possibly relevant” or “irrelevant.” Articles identified as “possibly relevant” by both reviewers progressed to full-text review and were further classified as “included” or “excluded.” During these processes, any disagreements between reviewers were resolved through discussion with a third reviewer (RDR) until a consensus was reached. The PRISMA flowchart (Fig. 1) provides detailed information about the search and selection process.Fig. 1PRISMA 2020 flow diagram for new systematic reviews which included searches of databases and registers only.Fig. 12.3Data extractionThe sample size, mean score, and standard deviation of all outcomes at post-treatment or follow-up measurements were retrieved for statistical analysis. Additionally, study ID, participant characteristics (age and sex), study characteristics (country), therapy characteristics (type, format, session, duration, and frequency of therapy), and outcome characteristics (outcome, instrument, and time measurement) were extracted for reporting. The extraction process was conducted by two authors (EM, NY) using an Excel-based form following Cochrane guidelines [23] and was checked by the primary authors (ABH, H) to evaluate its accuracy and relevance.2.4Risk of bias assessmentThe overall methodological quality of RCTs was assessed based on Cochrane Collaboration's risk-of-bias (ROB 2) tool by two reviewers (RD and EM). The aspects evaluated included the randomization process, deviations from the intended intervention, missing outcome data, measurement of the outcome, and reporting results. The assessment results were classified as low ROB, some concern, or high ROB.2.5Data synthesisData were examined and interpreted to identify significant results regarding the effectiveness of HBCR on HRQoL and patient outcomes. Due to the varied outcomes reported by the included studies, we categorized the outcomes into four groups: 1) QoL; 2) cardiovascular capacity, measured by peak VO2 and the 6 MWD; 3) cardiovascular disease risk factors, including lipid profiles (total, HDL and LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides) and blood pressure; and 4) rehospitalization rates. Other relevant outcomes were synthesized narratively.The statistical analysis was conducted using R version 4.4.0. Data were analyzed using the metacont package based on a random-effects model. Forest plots were generated to visually represent the outcome effects, with the pooled effectiveness reported in standardized mean differences (SMDs) along with a 95 % confidence interval (CI) and a 95 % prediction interval. Heterogeneity was analyzed using I2, Q-statistic, and p-values, with I2 > 50 % indicating significant heterogeneity [24]. A larger I2 value suggested greater effects of study variations [25]. A sensitivity analysis was conducted by excluding one study at a time to evaluate its impact on the overall results. Publication bias was assessed using funnel plots and the Egger regression test, with a p-value <0.1 indicating significant publication bias.3Result3.1Study selection and exclusionA total of 237 articles were identified from seven databases and one trial registration platform. In total, 154 articles were screened based on their titles and abstracts after removing duplicates. Thereafter, 70 potential articles were screened based on their full texts. After a manual search through Google Scholar, no additional eligible articles were included; thus, 19 studies were eligible for inclusion in this meta-analysis.

Among the RCTs, approximately 57.2 %, 9.5 %, and 33.3 % had a low, medium, and high ROB, respectively (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Risk of bias in included studies.Fig. 23.4Stratification of cardiovascular risk in included studiesTo assess the stratification of the study populations in our analysis, we reviewed 19 studies included in the meta-analysis. Among these, 3 studies explicitly categorized participants into low and moderate/medium-risk groups as part of their inclusion criteria [5,42,43]. Two studies did not provide detailed information on their inclusion criteria [44,45]. The remaining 14 studies outlined both inclusion and exclusion criteria, from which we inferred that the exclusion criteria corresponded to high-risk categories, based on the guidelines of the American Association of Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Rehabilitation [46].From this analysis, we conclude that the studies included in our meta-analysis predominantly involve populations classified as low to moderate risk. Specifically, two studies set participants in the low-risk category, while 14 studies included subjects in both low and moderate-risk categories. This finding aligns with previous research by Thomas et al. [21], which indicated that most HBCR studies primarily target subjects in low-to-moderate risk categories. Therefore, we can confidently state that the population in our analysis is relatively homogeneous with regard to cardiovascular risk. This stratification is crucial because it ensures that the results of our analysis reflect the outcomes typically observed in low-to-moderate risk populations—groups that are the primary focus of most HBCR interventions.Subgroup analysis was not conducted for outcomes involving studies with low-risk participants (6 MWD, lipid profile, and blood pressure), as only one study provided data for each of these outcomes. Given the limited number of studies, subgroup analysis would not have provided additional meaningful information or insights. Therefore, these outcomes were considered as part of the overall analysis without further stratification. Future research, particularly that which includes high-risk individuals, is crucial for gaining a deeper understanding of how HBCR can be effectively tailored to meet the needs of all patient subgroups.3.5Effect of interventionThe primary outcome of this study was QoL, which is a key goal of CR program. Secondary outcomes included cardiovascular capacity, measured as peak VO2 and 6 MWD, as well as cardiovascular risk factors such as lipid profiles (total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides) and blood pressure. These two risk factors were considered intermediate outcomes, closely related to the risk of recurrent ACS, reflecting the broader effects of CR in reducing risk factors through core components such as diet, exercise, and medication adherence. Rehospitalization and mortality were also secondary outcomes. Although rehospitalization and mortality are key goals of CR, they were classified as secondary outcomes in this study due to the limited number of studies reporting data, which restricted the ability to analyze them as primary outcomes.Each outcome was analyzed by comparing HBCR with hospital-based CR, as well as HBCR with usual care. Additionally, subgroup analyses will be performed based on follow-up duration, with groups divided into those with 3 months or less of follow-up and those with follow-up longer than 3 months. The 3-month cut-off was chosen because it is the minimum follow-up duration typically used in the CR studies. Further subgroup analyses based on specific time points (e.g., 3, 6, 9, and 12 months) were not feasible due to the limited number of studies available for each outcome. Other relevant outcomes will be summarized narratively, as they involve different measurement metrics across studies.3.5.1Primary outcome: quality of lifeIn the studies reviewed, significant variation was found in the presentation of QoL data across the analyzed studies. This variation is primarily due to differences in the measurement instruments used. Out of the 12 studies that measured QoL as an outcome, only seven studies reported overall QoL results, while the others reported results across various dimensions in different ways. Therefore, in our analysis, we present only the overall QoL data, as it was not feasible to analyze all studies due to the variation in the types of dimensions measured.3.5.1.1QoL comparison between HBCR and comparator groupsSeven studies [8,20,21,24,32,33,35] compared QoL between HBCR and various comparator groups, including hospital-based CR and usual care. These studies involved a total of 2438 participants. The study by Kraal et al. [32] was excluded from the analysis due to its exceptionally high SMD value, which indicated that its results were significantly different from those of the other studies and made it an outlier. In our sensitivity analysis, we found that this had a disproportionate influence on the meta-analysis results and contributed substantially to the observed heterogeneity across the studies. Excluding this study caused a significant change in the overall effect estimate. Before removal, the overall effect estimate was 0.51, with a confidence interval (CI) of [0.02 to 0.99]. After excluding this study, the effect estimate decreased to 0.17, with a narrower CI of [0.0 to 0.33]. The other effect is further demonstrated by a reduction in heterogeneity, which dropped from 91.7 % to 73.1 %.Using the random-effects model based on data from six studies, a statistically significant difference in QoL was found between HBCR and all comparator groups (SMD = 0.17, 95 % CI = [0.00 to 0.33), with significant heterogeneity among the studies (I2 = 73.1 %) (Fig. 3).Fig. 3Effect of HBCR on QoL.

According to the random-effects model, no significant difference in QoL was found between HBCR and hospital-based CR (SMD 0.05, 95 % CI −0.16 to 0.25), with no significant heterogeneity across the studies (I2 = 56.3 %). The group receiving HBCR had similar QoL scores to the group receiving hospital-based CR (Fig. 3).3.5.1.3HBCR and usual careThree studies involving a total of 1343 participants, compared QoL between HBCR and usual care. According to the random-effects model, a statistically significant difference in QoL was found between HBCR and usual care (SMD 0.29, 95 % CI 0.11 to 0.46), with no significant heterogeneity among the studies (I2 = 54 %). The group receiving HBCR had significantly higher QoL scores compared to the group receiving usual care (Fig. 3).3.5.2Secondary outcomes: HBCR and hospital-based CR3.5.2.1MortalityA meta-analysis could not be conducted due to the availability of only one study reporting mortality events between HBCR and hospital-based CR, which had some concerns regarding the risk of bias [48]. This study found no significant difference in mortality events between the HBCR and hospital-based CR groups at the 12-month follow-up (p-value = 0.3).3.5.2.2RehospitalizationOnly one study [49] with a high risk of bias (Fig. 2) compared the rehospitalization rates between the HBCR and hospital-based CR groups, involving a total of 80 participants with a follow-up period of 6 months. The results indicated a significant difference in rehospitalization rates between the HBCR group compared to the hospital-based CR group (p value<0.01)3.5.2.3Cardiovascular capacityThree studies assessed 6 MWD [6,8,20], comparing results of 6 MWT between HBCR and hospital-based CR, with a total of 1,075 participants. The random-effects model showed no significant difference in 6 MWD between the HBCR and hospital-based CR groups (SMD 0.34, 95 % CI −0.21 to 0.88), but there was significant heterogeneity across the studies (I2 = 90 %, p < 0.01) (Fig. 4).Fig. 4Effect of HBCR on cardiovascular capacity compared to Hospital-based CR. A. Effect of HBCR on 6 MWD compared to Hospital-based CR; B. Effect of HBCR on peak VO2 compared to Hospital-based CR. HBCR: Home-based Cardiac Rehabilitation, CR: Cardiac Rehabilitation, 6 MWD: 6-min walk distance, SD: Standard Deviation, CI: Confidence Interval, SMD: Standardised Mean Difference.Fig. 4Furthermore, three studies reported peak VO2 values between HBCR and hospital-based CR [18,24,25], involving a total of 255 participants. The random-effects model found no significant difference in peak VO2 between the two groups (SMD 0.02, 95 % CI [−0.55 to 0.60]), with notable heterogeneity observed (I2 = 77.7 %, p = 0.0113) (Fig. 4). Two studies that reported long-term effects (12 and 15 months) [5,40] indicated better improvements in peak VO2 for the HBCR group. However, these improvements were not statistically significant.3.5.2.4Cardiovascular risk factorsNo significant differences were observed in total, LDL, or HDL cholesterols levels between the HBCR and hospital-based CR groups. Only triglyceride level showed a statistically significant difference, favoring the HBCR group. One study with a low risk of bias compared triglyceride level between the groups, involving 76 participants with a 6-week follow-up. The HBCR group had significantly lower triglyceride level than the hospital-based CR group (SMD −0.26, 95 % CI −0.51 to −0.0, p = 0.04) (Fig. 5). Similarly, no significant differences were found between the HBCR and hospital-based CR groups for either systolic or diastolic blood pressure (Fig. 6).Fig. 5Effect of HBCR on lipid profile compared Hospital-based CR.

The meta-analysis showed no significant difference in mortality between the HBCR and usual care groups (OR 0.74, 95 % CI [0.09 to 6.18]), with no significant heterogeneity among the studies (I2 = 19.9 %) (Fig. 7). The risk of bias across the studies was low.Fig. 7Effect of HBCR on mortality and rehospitalization compared to usual care. A. Effect of HBCR on mortality compared to usual care. B.

HBCR: Home-based Cardiac Rehabilitation, OR: Odds ratio; CI: Confidence interval.Fig. 7One study could not be included in the meta-analysis because it did not report the number of mortality events. However, this study demonstrated a significant reduction in all-cause mortality (log-rank p = 0.049) over 3 years in the CR+ group compared to the CR− group. This finding contrasts with the results of the meta-analysis, where no significant difference in mortality was observed.3.5.3.2RehospitalizationTwo studies [39,50] reported rehospitalization events in patients undergoing HBCR versus usual care, involving a total of 414 patients with a 12-month follow-up period. The meta-analysis indicated no significant difference in rehospitalization rates between the HBCR and usual care groups (OR 1.09, 95 % CI [0.50 to 2.35]), with no significant heterogeneity across the studies (I2 = 55,7 %) (Fig. 7). The risk of bias across the studies was low (Fig. 2).3.5.3.3Cardiovascular capacityThree studies [31,33,34], involving a total of 946 participants, compared peak VO2 between HBCR and usual care. Due to high heterogeneity among the studies (I2 = 99.15 %), a meta-analysis was not conducted. In the previous study, a significant improvement in peak VO2 was observed in patients with MINOCA (myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries) who underwent HBCR [40]. These improvements were noted both at the beginning of the intervention and after 36 months of follow-up (p < 0.01). In contrast, no significant changes were found in the usual care group. Although the study by Chen et al. did not show a significant difference in peak VO2 between the HBCR and usual care groups, it did report a notable improvement within the HBCR group, with peak VO2 increasing from baseline to 3 months of follow-up [38]. In the study by Snoek et al., peak VO2 increased by 8.5 % after 6 months and 6.5 % after 12 months in the HBCR group, while no significant improvement was observed in the usual care group [50]. In summary, while the statistical significance of these improvements could not be firmly established, these three studies collectively suggest that HBCR has a positive impact on cardiovascular capacity, as reflected by improvements in peak VO2.3.5.3.4Cardiovascular risk factorsNo significant differences were observed in total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels between the HBCR and usual care groups (Fig. 8). Similarly, no significant differences were found between the HBCR and usual care groups for either systolic or diastolic blood pressures (Fig. 9).Fig. 8Effect of HBCR on lipid profile compared to usual care.

Using the random-effects model, the results showed a significant difference in HDL cholesterol level between the HBCR and usual care groups (SMD 0.18, 95 % CI 0.02–0.34), with no significant heterogeneity among the studies (I2 = 4.6 %) (Fig. 8). Similarly, a significant difference in triglyceride level was found between the HBCR and usual care groups in three studies [26,27,29], involving 345 participants (SMD −0.34, 95 % CI −0.57 to −0.11), with no significant heterogeneity among the studies (I2 = 0.00 %) (Fig. 8).3.5.4Patient satisfaction and adherenceA study conducted by Varnfield et al. [51] showed that the ACS patient group undergoing HBCR using smartphones and a specific platform (CAP CR: Care Assessment Platform of CR) had higher adherence and completion rates compared to those receiving hospital-based CR. Similarly, Grace et al. [7] found that women participating in HBCR demonstrated higher adherence rates than their counterparts in the hospital, with a focus exclusively on woman participants.Additionally, patients undergoing HBCR exhibited greater adherence to walking exercises and medication compared to those receiving hospital-based CR [6]. Beyond adherence rates, HBCR also resulted in higher patient satisfaction levels compared to hospital-based CR. This was highlighted in a study by Kraal et al. [32] which found that while there were no significant differences in exercise adherence between patients in home and hospital settings, satisfaction levels were significantly higher among those rehabilitating at home. Furthermore, another study [6] indicated that patient satisfaction was greater after 12 months of participating in the HBCR program compared to those undergoing hospital-based CR.4Discussion4.1The HBCR enhances QoLIn the overall analysis, HBCR demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in QoL compared to the comparator groups (SMD 0.51, 95 % CI 0.02 to 0.99), indicating that, on average, HBCR has a positive impact on QoL. However, the observed heterogeneity (I2 = 73 %, p < 0.01) suggests considerable variability across the included studies. To address the impact of extreme values on heterogeneity, we conducted sensitivity analyses by removing outliers in the SMD, which reduced the I2 to a more moderate level(91,7 % to 73 %). While some heterogeneity remains, it is considered within acceptable limits for meta-analysis, particularly in rehabilitation research [52]. Heterogeneity in CR studies is inevitable and can arise from various factors, including differences in patient characteristics such as age range and clinical diagnoses like ACS, as well as the diversity in intervention types (e.g., exercise modalities, duration, intensity, and settings). Previous systematic reviews in the field of CR have reported similar levels of heterogeneity, which is typically associated with variations in interventions, patient populations, and outcome measures [52,53]. This aligns with findings from other meta-analyses in CR, where moderate-to-high heterogeneity is commonly observed and does not undermine the validity of the findings, as it reflects the real-world complexity of CR programs.Despite this variability, the significant effect size supports the conclusion that HBCR is beneficial in improving QoL. A review by Zhong et al. [13] further supports this conclusion, noting enhancements in physical functioning among patients undergoing PCI in the HBCR group using telemonitoring, compared to the control group. One key factor contributing to these positive outcomes is the higher adherence rates observed in HBCR programs. Consistent with previous research, HBCR is not only comparably effective but also more cost-effective. Notably, among the 11 studies reviewed, only one reported low adherence, suggesting that HBCR effectively promotes exercise continuity and patient commitment, leading to improved QoL outcomes [42]. The CR, particularly HBCR, plays a crucial role in enhancing QoL by encouraging increased physical activity, improving vocational status, and fostering psychological well-being [54].When comparing HBCR to hospital-based CR the overall impact on QoL was similar. This suggests that, while hospital-based CR may provide more immediate or higher-impact results, HBCR serves as a viable and comparable alternative—particularly for individuals who may not have easy access to hospital-based CR. When comparing HBCR to hospital-based CR, the overall impact on QoL was similar. Eight studies evaluated health-related QoL between HBCR and hospital-based CR, with six finding no significant differences [6,8,[28], [29], [30],32,33,55]. Both groups showed significant improvements; however, in two studies, the HBCR group demonstrated better QoL, particularly in the emotional dimension, after six weeks [28,29,32]. This suggests that, while hospital-based CR may provide more immediate or higher-impact results, HBCR serves as a viable and comparable alternative—particularly for individuals who may not have easy access to hospital-based CR. The study by Varnfield et al. even showed better QoL outcomes for patients undergoing HBCR compared to those receiving hospital-based CR [8]. The study utilized smartphones, allowing patients to track their daily exercise progress and receive weekly education, which helped improve adherence and effectiveness in their daily exercise routine [8].Compared to usual care, HBCR demonstrated significant improvements in QoL, although with substantial heterogeneity. Notably, the long-term follow-up groups (≥12 months) highlighted sustained benefits of HBCR, with these benefits becoming more pronounced over time compared to usual care. In the study by Campo et al., elderly patients in the intervention group showed better QoL scores at both the 6-month and 1-year visits [39]. This was further supported by a reduction in physical complaints and mobility difficulties compared to the control group [39]. A similar finding was observed in the study by He et al., where MINOCA patients showed better physical QoL scores after 1 year, although no significant differences were found in the emotional dimension [40].The long-term benefits of HBCR on QoL are likely attributed to a combination of sustained lifestyle changes, psychological adaptation, and cumulative physiological improvements resulting from ongoing participation in rehabilitation activities. While HBCR produces immediate health benefits in the short term, its effects on QoL are more consistently sustained and become more evident over time. Patients are better prepared for the transition following illness through a comprehensive CR program. Psychological benefits, such as improvements in mood, self-esteem, and stress reduction, are also more pronounced in the long term. Previous studies demonstrated that the HBCR group showed significant improvements in anxiety [29,37]. Moreover, these long-term improvements are shaped by patients’ ability to adapt to their health conditions and develop effective coping strategies. As patients become more familiar with their condition and the rehabilitation process, they are better equipped to rely on these strategies, leading to more stable and lasting improvements in their overall QoL.However, patients cannot be left to navigate the HBCR process alone. Consistently changing habits is difficult because patients are often stuck in old routines and feel incapable of making changes without guidance from healthcare professionals [56]. Adequate information and ongoing monitoring by healthcare providers are essential to ensure that patients remain consistent in making lifestyle changes and achieving the desired outcomes.The study by Zhong et al. highlighted the positive impact of HBCR, especially when telerehabilitation was used [57]. It demonstrated significant improvements in cardiovascular capacity and (QoL. Patients were better prepared for recovery through a comprehensive CR program, which included regular communication with healthcare providers via social media platforms, weekly educational videos, and access to physical exercise data shared between healthcare providers and patients [57].In addition to adequate information and monitoring by healthcare professionals, behavior change is influenced by many factors, such as psychological stress, daily life pressures, and barriers from social environments [58]. Family can play a crucial role as a supportive factor by providing positive encouragement, which can enhance the long-term effectiveness of HBCR in improving QoL [59]. Family-centered care has been shown to increase adherence to therapeutic regimens and diet in patients with heart disease Thus, a family-centered approach may serve as an effective strategy to improve patient health status and overall QoL [60].4.2HBCR is as effective as hospital-based CR in enhancing cardiovascular function and reducing risk factorsA subgroup meta-analysis comparing HBCR to hospital-based CR found no differences across peak VO2, 6 MWD, lipid profiles, and blood pressure, indicating that HBCR is as effective as hospital-based CR [28,29,32]. Furthermore, HBCR was associated with higher satisfaction levels and lower costs compared to hospital-based CR [32] Similarly, Li et al. found that satisfaction levels in the HBCR group were higher 12 months post-program [49].Although improvements were observed in both groups during the follow-up period, no differences in peak VO2 values were found between patients undergoing HBCR with telemonitoring and those in hospital-based CR [32,42]. A notable difference was seen in the study by Batalik et al., where peak VO2 was higher in patients undergoing HBCR as compared to those receiving hospital-based CR after 1 year of follow-up [33]. This may be related to the structure of the HBCR program, which included supervision by cardiologists and physiotherapists, teleconsultations, and daily progress monitoring through a web platform [33]. These factors may have contributed to the higher quality of physical activity performed by patients at home.This finding is significant, indicating that HBCR is as effective as hospital-based CR in improving cardiovascular metrics and reducing cardiovascular disease risk factors including blood pressure and lipid profile. This is crucial, as it demonstrates that HBCR programs can serve as an effective alternative, particularly for patients who may have difficulty accessing hospital facilities. Additionally, it could reduce costs and enhance patient adherence to CR programs.However, the study by Lee et al. found that improvements in lipid profile and blood pressure occurred only in the hospital-based CR group and not in the HBCR group [27]. This may be due to more adequate exposure to information and education, with a stronger emphasis on diet management in the hospital setting. This finding underscores an important consideration for the development of HBCR programs, highlighting the need to ensure that HBCR offers sufficient information and monitoring to support effective diet management and overall health improvement.This is further supported by the Varnfield et al. study [8], which showed better results in diastolic blood pressure and triglyceride levels of HBCR as compared to hospital-based CR. These improvements were attributed to the use of smartphones for exercise and vital sign monitoring, as well as the delivery of motivational and educational materials to participants via text messages and videos.In conclusion, while systematic reviews indicate that HBCR is as effective as hospital-based CR in improving outcomes, it is crucial to note the importance of ongoing monitoring by healthcare professionals in the implementation of these programs.4.3HBCR demonstrates superior effectiveness compared to usual care in QOL, HDL, and triglycerideIn a comprehensive subgroup meta-analysis comparing HBCR with usual care, significant improvements were observed in QoL, triglyceride level, and HDL cholesterol, highlighting HBCR as a superior rehabilitation approach. Patients participating in HBCR demonstrated lower mean scores on modifiable risk factors compared to those receiving traditional outpatient care [9,54].The QoL assessments conducted between 3 and 12 months revealed that individuals undergoing HBCR outperformed their counterparts in routine outpatient programs [37,39,40]. Furthermore, HBCR participants exhibited enhanced physical activity levels, greater average daily steps, and improved exercise capacity relative to those receiving standard outpatient treatment [9,[34], [35], [36]]. These findings are significant as they serve as indicators of successful risk reduction, given that HDL cholesterol is a key component in the atherosclerosis process, with higher HDL cholesterol levels being associated with a reduced risk of atherosclerosis [61]. Additionally, these results suggest that lipid-lowering medications may be more effective when combined with consistent physical exercise [34].Importantly, the HBCR group recorded significantly lower mean triglyceride levels compared to the usual care group [34,36,38] and a notable difference in HDL cholesterol level was also in favor of the HBCR group [34]. Four studies indicated that HBCR led to greater decreases in triglyceride level compared to usual care [34,36,38,62]. These findings reinforce previous research, emphasizing that the core components of HBCR—physical exercise, dietary management, and medication adherence—can have a more significant impact on patients receiving lipid-lowering treatment. Numerous studies have shown the positive effects of consistent physical activity in improving lipid profile [[63], [64], [65], [66], [67]]. Adherence to diets rich in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and low in saturated fatty acids (SFAs) has been shown to improve lipid profile in patients with cardiovascular disease [66,68,69]. Improved adherence to these components in HBCR programs can lead to sustained lifestyle changes, ultimately resulting in better long-term health outcomes for patients. However, the LDL and total cholesterol levels in the HBCR group were not significantly different from those in the usual care group, suggesting the need for further investigation into barriers, particularly in dietary management and oversight during HBCR. A qualitative study found that a higher percentage of patients with poor dietary adherence participated in CR compared to those with good dietary adherence [70]. This highlights the potential impact of dietary habits on the effectiveness of the CR program.No significant differences were found between HBCR and usual care regarding peak VO2, and blood pressure. Nonetheless, when examining the studies individually, patients undergoing HBCR showed improvements in peak VO2, physical activity, mean daily steps, and exercise capacity compared to those receiving standard care [[34], [35], [36],41,71]. This warrants further investigation into why the CR program does not positively impact heart function as measured by peak VO2 and blood pressure. One possible explanation for these findings is the typically lower exercise intensity in HBCR. Since HBCR often lacks direct supervision, the intensity of physical activity may not be sufficient to achieve the same physiological improvements seen in HBCR [38,72]. The effectiveness of physical exercise in enhancing heart function should be reconsidered within the context of HBCR. Key questions to explore include whether patients are performing exercises in line with the prescribed program, whether they are executing the exercises correctly, and what barriers may still hinder physical activity. Identifying these factors is essential for understanding the limitations of HBCR and improving patient outcomes in future CR efforts.Another contributing factor may be the lack of professional support in HBCR. The limited involvement of healthcare providers in supporting HBCR participation presents a significant challenge to patient compliance [73]. Without continuous medical supervision, patients may lack the motivation and guidance necessary to perform exercises correctly, which could diminish the program's overall effectiveness. Additionally, variability in HBCR protocols across different studies can lead to inconsistent outcomes. This is consistent with the findings of previous systematic reviews [74]. Differences in factors such as program duration, exercise intensity, and the use of technology can influence the results, making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions. The comparison of mortality and rehospitalization rates between HBCR and usual care shows no significant difference. However, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that HBCR significantly impacts mortality compared to usual care. This lack of conclusive evidence is due to contradictory results from the two studies that reported mortality and rehospitalization outcomes [39,41]. Additionally, the broad confidence interval (CI) and the absence of statistical significance highlight uncertainty in the findings. Therefore, further studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods are needed to provide more definitive conclusions. Indicate uncertainty in the results, underscoring the need for additional research to draw more definitive conclusions.4.4Challenges in HBCRAlthough the benefits of HBCR on QoL are more evident in the long term, the effects of HBCR on other outcomes appear to be more prominent in the short term. Our analysis reveals that HBCR has varying effects on lipid profiles depending on the follow-up duration. LDL cholesterol levels showed no significant change, regardless of follow-up length. In contrast, HBCR had a more pronounced effect on HDL cholesterol and triglycerides in the short term (≤3 months), with these benefits diminishing over time (follow-up >3 months).The decline in long-term follow-up scores is also reflected in the outcomes of the 6 MWT result. The 6MWD by the HBCR group decreased from 408.6 m at 6 months to 391.3 m at 12 months [28]. A similar finding was reported in Li et al. study, where at 3 and 6 months, the 6 MWT outcomes for patients in HBCR were lower compared to those in the hospital-based CR group [6].Short-term improvements in HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and physical capacity are likely the result of acute physiological responses to exercise, temporary dietary changes, and improved psychological well-being. A combination of lipid interventions, including diet, medication, and appropriate exercise training, may be beneficial and help optimize individualized medical management for lipid disorders [75]. However, these benefits may not be sustained in the long term due to factors such as reduced exercise intensity, a return to previous eating habits, and metabolic adaptation. The effects of repeated low-intensity physical activities may lead to only minor, transient changes in lipid profiles that may not be noticeable in clinical trials. However, frequent aerobic training over a longer period may result in lasting improvements in lipid profiles [75]. Therefore, further research is needed to explore the long-term effects of HBCR and the factors influencing these outcomes. These time-dependent effects underscore the importance of understanding the mechanisms behind these changes and whether extended interventions or maintenance strategies can help sustain the benefits of HBCR over time.Additionally, a more targeted approach to HBCR is essential to maintain its long-term benefits, particularly through family empowerment strategies [[76], [77], [78]]. These strategies can provide ongoing support and guidance, helping patients maintain lifestyle changes and coping strategies beyond the rehabilitation program. Another challenge identified in this study is that HBCR was less effective in improving physical capacity and blood pressure. No significant differences were observed in peak VO2 or blood pressure between the HBCR and usual care groups. This may be related to the suboptimal nature of physical exercise performed at home without supervision. This highlights the need for an enhanced approach to HBCR, in addition to what is currently being implemented. Patients require ongoing support to maintain a healthy lifestyle over the long term. Furthermore, during physical exercise, patients should be guided to ensure that the frequency, intensity, duration, type, and progression of the exercises are appropriate. Given the limited time healthcare professionals have for monitoring patients at home, family members are likely to play a key role in providing support.4.5Strength and limitations of this studyThis analysis includes a diverse range of studies involving ACS patients who underwent various interventions, such as PCI, CABG, or no intervention at all. The patient population spans a wide age range, from those under 50 to those over 70, offering a comprehensive view across different age groups. Additionally, the HBCR interventions varied significantly, including telerehabilitation with remote monitoring, smartphone applications, and traditional HBCR with modules and diaries for self-reporting. The studies were conducted across multiple geographical regions, including Europe, Asia, and Australia.The diversity in patient populations, the variety of HBCR interventions, and the geographical spread of the studies all contribute to the strengths of this analysis. These factors enhance the external validity of the findings, making the results more generalizable across different settings, contexts, and patient populations.Despite these strengths, significant heterogeneity was observed across the studies, which limits the consistency and interpretability of the results [23]. This variability is likely due to differences in patient characteristics (such as age and type of ACS), the types of HBCR interventions used, and the geographical settings of the studies. Consequently, the findings should be interpreted with caution, as this heterogeneity may affect both the generalizability and reliability of the results.Furthermore, the study was limited to published articles in English, which may have excluded relevant research published in other languages or gray literature. The number of studies for certain outcomes was also limited, meaning the analysis for some outcomes was based on only a small number of studies. Additionally, several studies had small sample sizes (<100 participants), which further limits the strength of the conclusions drawn. Finally, some studies did not provide detailed descriptions of how the HBCR program was implemented, making it difficult to assess the consistency and quality of the interventions or to replicate them in other settings.5ConclusionsHBCR has consistently shown improvements in QoL compared to hospital-based CR and usual care. Subgroup meta-analyses indicate significant benefits in QoL, triglyceride level, and HDL cholesterol, positioning HBCR as a superior rehabilitation approach. Additionally, HBCR is as effective as hospital-based CR in all outcomes measured.However, key gaps remain in the literature. No studies have compared the six-minute walk test (6 MWT) between HBCR and usual care patients. Furthermore, studies measuring mortality and rehospitalization as key long-term outcomes of HBCR are very limited. Variability in HBCR implementation may also contribute to these inconsistencies, highlighting the need for more standardized protocols. Furthermore, trends suggest a decline in outcomes over time, with suboptimal results in LDL, peak VO2, and blood pressure, underscoring the importance of addressing challenges in the implementation of HBCR. Further research is needed to explore specific approaches, such as family involvement, in sustaining the rehabilitation process and improving long term outcomes.Central illustration.Unlabelled imageFundingThis work was supported by the Universitas Gadjah Mada under Program Rekognisi Tugas Akhir [grant number: 5286/UN1.P1/PT.01.03/2024].CRediT authorship contribution statementEva Marti: Writing – original draft, Methodology, Investigation, Funding acquisition, Formal analysis, Data curation, Conceptualization.

{"PMCID": "12258805", "title": "Sympathetic Overactivation in the Resistant Hypertensive Phenotype: A Meta-Analysis of Published Studies", "abstract": "BACKGROUND:Indirect and direct approaches to assess sympathetic cardiovascular drive have shown that patients with essential hypertension responsive to the blood pressure–lowering effects of antihypertensive drugs are characterized by a pronounced adrenergic overactivity. Whether an emerging clinical hypertensive phenotype such as drug-resistant hypertension (RHT) is also characterized by sympathetic activation and whether its magnitude and underlying pathophysiological mechanisms differ from those of non-RHT is undefined.METHODS:Among the 54 studies identified providing information in RHT on muscle sympathetic nerve traffic (MSNA), 12 were eligible (508 patients) and meta-analyzed, grouping them based on clinically relevant questions: (1) Is MSNA increased in RHT? (2) Does the magnitude of the sympathetic activation differ from that observed in non-RHT? (3) Are heart rate and plasma norepinephrine valuable surrogate markers of MSNA in RHT? and (4) Is baroreflex-MSNA control impaired?RESULTS:MSNA was significantly greater in patients with RHT than in normotensive patients (73.2±6.6 versus 46.1±11.1 bursts/100 heartbeats, means±SD; P<0.0001) and this was the case also when data were compared with patients with non-RHT (59.8±8.4 bursts/100 heartbeats; P<0.001), despite the greater number of antihypertensive drugs. At variance from non-RHT, in RHT, elevated MSNA was unrelated to heart rate and plasma venous norepinephrine. Similar to non-RHT, MSNA in RHT was inversely related to the baroreflex function.CONCLUSIONS:RHT is characterized by a sustained sympathetic overdrive, significantly greater in magnitude than the 1 detected in non-RHT. Neither heart rate nor norepinephrine are capable of reflecting the marked adrenergic overdrive seen in this condition via MSNA recordings.", "body": "Novelty and RelevanceWhat Is New?This meta-analysis is aimed at addressing 3 issues never examined before, that is, (1) the behavior of sympathetic nerve traffic, assessed via clinical microneurography, in resistant hypertension (RHT), (2) the comparison with non-RHT, and (3) the relationships between sympathetic nerve traffic, heart rate, plasma venous norepinephrine, and baroreflex function.Twelve microneurographic studies for a total of 512 patients were meta-analyzed.Results show that RHT exhibits a significant increase in sympathetic nerve traffic as compared with the normotensive control state. They also show that the sympathetic activation is significantly greater in magnitude than the 1 detected in non-RHT.In contrast to what was reported in essential hypertension responsive to the blood pressure–lowering effects of antihypertensive drugs, in RHT no significant relationship was found between sympathetic nerve traffic and surrogate sympathetic markers, such as plasma venous norepinephrine and heart rate. An inverse significant relationship was found with the baroreflex function.What Is Relevant?Results of the present meta-analysis provide the first evidence that the sympathetic overactivity characterizing essential hypertension is remarkably potentiated in RHT.Alterations in baroreflex cardiovascular modulation may contribute to this profound sympathetic activation, which can be only in part detectable by norepinephrine and heart rate assessment.Clinical/Pathophysiological Implications?The marked sympathetic activation detected in RHT may participate in the elevated cardiovascular risk profile of this clinical condition. Its specific detection in RHT also suggests the need to counteract the adrenergic overactivation with pharmacological and nonpharmacological (ie, bilateral renal nerve ablation) interventions capable of exerting sympathoinhibitory effects.Microneurographic studies based on the direct recording of efferent postganglionic sympathetic nerve traffic (MSNA) to the skeletal muscle vascular district in patients with essential hypertension have provided conclusive evidence that this clinical condition is characterized by a consistent sympathetic activation, thereby strengthening the findings (frequently not univocal) collected by employing indirect approaches to assess sympathetic cardiovascular function, such as the assay of plasma venous norepinephrine and the measurement of resting heart rate (HR).1–4 Evidence has been also provided that the sympathetic overdrive (1) is potentiated in patients with essential hypertension in which the high blood pressure (BP) state is associated with other clinical conditions also characterized by an adrenergic overdrive, (2) is detected independently on patients’ age and gender, (3) relates to the elevated BP values and the presence of target organ damage, and (4) characterizes different clinical hypertensive phenotypes, such as white-coat, masked, masked uncontrolled, and refractory hypertension.3,5–8Whether and to what extent another emerging clinical hypertensive phenotype, known as drug-resistant hypertension (RHT), is also characterized by sympathetic overactivation remains unclear. The issue has pathophysiological and clinical relevance, considering the potential therapeutic implications related to the detection of a hyperadrenergic state.9 Specifically, it remains unsettled whether RHT displays a sympathetic overdrive of greater magnitude than the 1 detected in the hypertensive states responsive to the BP-lowering effects of antihypertensive drugs. These uncertainties may rely on a variety of factors, including the small sample size of the studies available, frequently dependent on the difficulties intrinsic to the microneurographic technique to obtain stable MSNA recordings with an optimal signal-to-noise ratio in the recruited patients.The present meta-analysis was conceived to overcome some of the above limitations, by determining MSNA from a large number of studies and thus from a wider population sample. The analysis was extended to the relationships of MSNA with other surrogate neuroadrenergic markers, such as resting HR and plasma venous norepinephrine.3,10 In a few studies, analysis was also extended to the relationships of MSNA with arterial baroreceptor dysfunction, which characterizes high BP states including RHT.10,11MethodsData AvailabilityThe data supporting the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.Protocol and RegistrationWe assessed the difference in MSNA measures between patients with RHT and patients with hypertension without the RHT phenotype, used as controls. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were adhered to.12 This systematic review was registered at the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews database (URL: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/; Unique identifier: CRD42025636708).13Eligibility CriteriaCase-control or cohort studies were eligible whether they provided data for the comparison of MSNA measures between patients with (1) RHT subsequently undergoing renal denervation or carotid baroreflex stimulation versus RHT or non-RHT phenotype used as controls, (2) RHT versus non-RHT, and (3) RHT versus normotension. Differences in systolic/diastolic BP and the number of antihypertensive drugs used were additional mandatory criteria to include studies. In cohort studies of patients with RHT without a control group, a historical cohort of controls was used.14 We excluded studies (1) without or incomplete data on MSNA measures, (2) without BP or HR values, and (3) without information about the antihypertensive drug regimen.Information Sources and SearchIn the first week of September 2024, 3 independent reviewers (G.G., F.Q.-T., and C.T.) performed a systematic literature search in PubMed and the Cochrane Collaboration Library databases to select eligible studies published until August 31, 2024. A search strategy was organized around the setting of RHT and the measure of interest, that is, MSNA. The comparison between the RHT and the non-RHT phenotype was primarily pursued, but additional comparisons between RHT and controls were not excluded. Searching procedures with the appropriate keywords are presented in Table S1.Study Selection and Data Collection ProcessTitles and abstracts of studies retrieved through database searching were screened by 3 independent reviewers (G.G., F.Q.-T., and C.T.) to identify studies potentially meeting the inclusion criteria. The full text of these potentially eligible studies was retrieved and independently assessed for eligibility by the same 3 reviewers. Any disagreement was resolved through discussion. A standardized, prepiloted form was used to extract data from the included studies. Two reviewer authors (E.S. and C.C.) extracted data independently, while discrepancies were identified and resolved through discussion. For each study, the following information was extracted: publication details (first author’s name, journal, and year of publication), study characteristics (country of conduction and type of study), number of participants, mean age of participants, male sex prevalence, number of antihypertensive drugs, attrition rate, mean systolic/diastolic BP, and mean HR values.Risk of Bias in Individual Studies and Quality of EvidenceTwo independent reviewers (E.S. and R.F.) assessed the risk of bias in individual studies using the Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies - of Exposures (ROBINS-E) tool to reflect the studies’ quality.15 The 7 domains of the ROBINS-E tool through which bias may be introduced into outcomes refer to (1) bias because of confounding, (2) bias arising from the measurement of the exposure, (3) bias related to the selection of study participants, (4) bias related to postexposure interventions, (5) bias related to missing data, (6) bias related to the measurement of the outcome, and (7) bias in the selection of the reported result. For each domain, the possible risks of bias judgments are: (1) low risk of bias, (2) some concerns, and (3) high risk of bias. The overall risk of bias judgment for each study, about the examined outcome was defined as low risk of bias if the study was judged to be at low risk of bias for all domains for this result, some concerns if the study was considered to raise some concerns in at least 1 domain for this result, but not to be at high risk of bias for any domain and high risk of bias if the study was judged to be at high risk of bias in at least 1 domain for this result or the study is considered to have some concerns for multiple domains in a way that substantially lowers confidence in the result.The same 2 reviewers (E.S. and R.F.) rated the quality of evidence separately for each outcome using the grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation approach.16 Rating of the overall quality of evidence for each outcome is based on the judgments about each of the quality of evidence factors assessed (ie, risk of bias, indirectness, inconsistency, imprecision, and other considerations) and quality of evidence grades are defined as high, moderate, low, or very low. Disagreements between the 2 reviewer authors over the risk of bias in individual studies and the quality assessment of the evidence were resolved through discussion, with the involvement of a third reviewer author (G.M.) whenever necessary.Outcomes and Data AnalysisThe outcomes explored in this meta-analysis were MSNA values, expressed as bursts incidence over time (bursts/min) or as bursts incidence corrected for HR (bursts/100 heartbeats). In the primary analysis, all studies were considered together, and then sensitivity analyses were performed: (1) according to the type of comparison (RHT versus non-RHT, RHT in patients selected to undergo an interventional treatment of hypertension versus RHT with patients chosen not to proceed with an intervention), (2) limited to studies with a control group (ie, excluding cohort studies), and (3) limited to higher quality studies.Because no individual participant data were available, analyses were performed using the tabular data from the original study publications. Baseline clinical characteristics of the participants, baseline systolic/diastolic BP difference, baseline HR difference, and the difference in the number of drugs between the 2 arms represent the mean of individual study values weighted by participants’ number (ie, weighted average) using the random-effects model. Outcome variables were pooled as standard differences in means with 95% CI. Information on other markers of sympathetic activity such as HR was obtained in all studies, while plasma venous norepinephrine in 4 studies only. Data on baroreflex modulation of MSNA were reported in 3 studies only. The proportion of inconsistency across studies not explained by chance was assessed by the I2 index. A random-effects model was used for all analyses because it is the most appropriate when data from studies of the literature with different clinical characteristics are gathered together. The influence of an individual study on pooled effect size was tested by excluding 1 trial at a time: if the point estimate of the combined effect size with a given study excluded lay outside the 95% CI of the overall BP estimate with all available studies, the study in question was considered to have excessive influence. Univariate and multivariate meta-regression analyses with a limited and selective number of covariates (ie, age, the prevalence of male sex, baseline difference in systolic/diastolic BP, HR, and antihypertensive drugs) were conducted to determine whether the modulating effect of clinical variables remains significant. The publication bias was investigated graphically using funnel plots under a random-effects model, Duval, Tweedie’s trim and fill method, and Egger’s regression test. All statistical analyses were done using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis, version 3 (Biostat; Englewood, NJ). In each analysis, a P<0.05 (2-tailed) was considered statistically significant.ResultsStudy Selection and CharacteristicsThe flow diagram of the study selection process is shown in Figure 1. A total of 7519 records were identified through the database search. After duplicates were removed (n=3100), 4365 records were excluded based on the title and abstract evaluation, while 54 articles were assessed for eligibility at the full-text level. We further excluded 42 studies based on predetermined criteria, and we finally selected 12 studies for a total of 508 patients.11,17–27 Recruited patients mean age amounted to 57.4 years, men to 75.2%, systolic/diastolic BP difference to 20.6/11.0 mm Hg, HR difference to 0.5 bpm, difference in the number of antihypertensive drugs to 2. Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the studies included in the present meta-analysis.11,17–27Table 1.Clinical Characteristics of the Studies Included in the Meta-AnalysisFigure 1.Flowchart summarizing the methodology for selecting the included studies. BP indicates blood pressure; HTN, hypertension; and MSNA, muscle sympathetic nerve traffic.MSNA Measures in RHT: Primary AnalysisIn all studies, the standard difference in means between groups amounted to 0.55 (95% CI, 0.30–0.50) for bursts/min and 0.48 (95% CI, 0.13–0.83) for bursts/100 heartbeats (Figure 2). The heterogeneity between studies was moderate to significant. No study excessively affected the outcomes according to one-study removed analysis (data not shown). Regarding the unstandardized difference in means, MSNA as bursts/min and as bursts/100 heartbeats amounted to 6.70 (95% CI, 3.16–10.25) and 7.97 (95% CI, 1.84–14.10), respectively.Figure 2.Mean differences in muscle sympathetic nerve traffic (MSNA) between patients with resistant hypertension (RHT) and patients with essential nonresistant hypertension and normotensive subjects (controls). A, MSNA expressed as bursts incidence over time (bursts/min). B, Muscle sympathetic nerve traffic values corrected for heart rate (MSNAc) expressed as bursts incidence corrected for heart rate (bursts/100 heartbeats).Sensitivity AnalysesThe comparison between RHT and non-RHT groups demonstrated significantly higher MSNA values, favoring the former group (Figure 3; Table 2). Notably, heterogeneity was downgraded compared with the higher levels of heterogeneity observed in the primary analysis. In Table 2, it is also possible to note that MSNA values between patients with RHT scheduled to undergo interventional treatment (renal denervation) and those not selected for the procedure were not different. By excluding studies in which a historical cohort was chosen as a comparator, only the difference in MSNA expressed as bursts/min remained significant. The analysis, including studies of higher quality, was not different compared with the primary analysis (Table 2).Table 2.Sensitivity Analysis Limited to Studies With Different Characteristics or Level of QualityFigure 3.Muscle sympathetic nerve traffic (MSNA) expressed as bursts frequency over time (bursts/min, left) and as bursts frequency corrected for heart rate (MSNAc; bursts/100 heartbeats, right) in normotensive subjects (NT), nonresistant (HT), and resistant essential (RHT) hypertensives. Differences between groups were highly statistically significant (always P<0.05). Data are shown as means±SD. Data from 508 individuals were evaluated in 12 microneurographic studies.Meta-Regression AnalysesUnivariate meta-regression analyses demonstrated a marginal but significant positive association between MSNA values and the difference in systolic BP between groups. No significant association was detected between resting HR and MSNA values, both when expressed as burst frequency over time (β-standardized coefficient, 0.07; P=NS) and as bursts corrected for HR (β-standardized coefficient, 0.44; P=NS). This was the case also for the relationships between venous plasma norepinephrine and MSNA values (r=0.11; P=NS). A significant association between the difference in the number of antihypertensive medications and MSNA in bursts/100 heartbeats was also detected (Table S2). In a multivariable meta-regression model (Table 3), the differences in HR, age, and number of antihypertensive drugs were related to MSNA expressed as bursts/min, but not to MSNA expressed as bursts/100 heartbeats. MSNA values were significantly and inversely related to baroreflex-MSNA function (r=−0.34; P<0.05) in the 3 published studies evaluating in 35 patients this variable. No data were available to differentiate MSNA activation in controlled versus uncontrolled RHT phenotypes.Table 3.Multivariate Meta-Regression Analyses for the Association of Different Confounders With OutcomesPublication Bias, Risk of Bias Within Studies, and Rating of Evidence QualityAs shown in the funnel plots (Figure S1), no publication bias was produced for both outcomes under the random-effects plotting, a finding further suggested by Egger’s regression test. However, the trim and fill test indicated that the imputed effect would be significantly higher than the observed by 25% and 21% for MSNA quantified as bursts/min and as bursts/100 heartbeats, respectively. As indicated in Table S3, the overall risk of bias was low except for concerns about uncontrolled confounding for almost 83% of studies, while 1 study had a low risk of bias and another had a high risk of bias. According to the grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation approach, the quality of evidence was rated as low or very low for the estimated outcomes. The level of evidence was downgraded because of the observational nature of the study design, the extent of inconsistency, and concerns about publication bias for 1 outcome measure (Table S4).DiscussionThe present meta-analysis collecting 12 studies, including 259 RHT and 249 normotensive and essential non-RHT controls, is the first ever done evaluating MSNA in RHT and comparing the results with those obtained in nonresistant patients with hypertension. The main study findings can be summarized as follows. First, a direct sensitive marker of the adrenergic cardiovascular drive, such as MSNA, shows a marked and highly significant increase when assessed in RHT as compared with normotensive controls of similar age. Second, the magnitude of the sympathetic activation appears to be much more pronounced, and highly significantly greater, in RHT than in non-RHT patients also of similar age. Third, the differences in adrenergic activation appear only in part related to the difference in BP values between groups. Specifically, in the multivariable analysis, it was found that systolic, but not diastolic, BP values showed a positive significant association with MSNA. Finally, the greater MSNA values found in RHT as compared with non-RHT patients were detectable despite the fact that RHT were treated with a larger number of antihypertensive drugs (on average 2) and thus under a pharmacological treatment with potentially more marked sympathomodulatory effects. It should be worthy of mention, however, that some of the antihypertensive agents used in RHT treatment, such as calcium channel blockers, loop diuretics, and peripheral vasodilatory agents, should have triggered sympathoexcitatory effects.9 We cannot thus exclude that, at least in part, the marked sympathetic overactivation detected in RHT may derive from a larger use in these patients of compounds exerting sympathoexcitatory effects.It can be thus concluded that patients with RHT are characterized by a sympathetic overactivity of much greater magnitude than the 1 characterizing non-RHT and that this is the case regardless of the hypertension severity, the initial or the later stage of the hypertension condition, and the presence of a heightened pharmacological treatment. These conclusions are strengthened by the evidence that data were obtained from a large database ever (about 500 patients).Several other findings of this study deserve to be discussed. First, as mentioned under Results, no study included in the present meta-analysis provides data allowing to determine whether there is a difference in the MSNA activation between RHT patients with BP uncontrolled or controlled by antihypertensive agents. It should be worthy of mention, however, that in a recent study, we found that in treated patients with essential hypertension, even when displaying satisfactory BP control (BP values <140/90 mm Hg and in some cases <130/80 mm Hg) MSNA remains significantly greater as compared with normotensive controls.28 This finding thus indicates that, regardless of BP control, sympathetic activity is not normalized by antihypertensive drug treatment, potentially exerting a harmful impact, particularly in RHT, on the patient’s cardiovascular risk profile.28Second, the results of our study show that in RHT, MSNA was not related to HR values assessed at rest. This finding may imply that at variance from what has been reported in patients with non-RHT essential hypertension responsive to antihypertensive drug treatment and other clinical conditions characterized by sympathetic activation, such as obesity, chronic heart failure, metabolic syndrome, renal insufficiency, and failure,10,29–33 in RHT there is a regional heterogeneity of the sympathetic activation, which appears be present at peripheral vascular level but not at the level of the heart. Our findings may also suggest, however, that HR may not represent a sensitive marker of the marked sympathetic overdrive characterizing RHT. This may be because HR is modulated not only by the sympathetic drive but also, and to a greater extent, by the parasympathetic influences on the sinus node.34 Based on the data collected in the other clinical conditions mentioned above,29–33 this hypothesis can be regarded more likely than the previous one.Third, in the patients with RHT of the present meta-analysis, venous plasma norepinephrine did not show any significant relationship with MSNA values, in sharp contrast with the significant relationship found between these variables in a previous meta-analysis performed in essential hypertensives responsive to the BP-lowering effects of antihypertensive drugs.1 Although the small number of meta-analyzed studies in which plasma norepinephrine was assessed in patients with RHT did not allow to make any firm conclusion, this finding may suggest that venous plasma norepinephrine may have limitations in reflecting the adrenergic cardiovascular overdrive characterizing RHT.Our meta-analysis shows that in the patients with RHT who underwent evaluation of the baroreflex-MSNA control, this variable was inversely related to resting MSNA values, namely that an impaired modulation of sympathetic drive by arterial baroreceptors (and thus a greater baroreflex dysfunction) is associated with more elevated values of MSNA. This suggests that arterial baroreceptor impairment may be one of the mechanisms involved in the development of the RHT-related marked sympathetic overdrive. However, given the consideration that a similar baroreflex dysfunction has been also reported in the non-RHT phenotype,1,3,10 the specificity of this finding to RHT appears unlikely. Finally, this study was not designed to determine the mechanisms through which the sympathetic overactivation found in RHT may participate in determining the sustained BP elevation characterizing this hypertensive phenotype. We can, however, identify 2 pathophysiological processes, mediated by an increase in the sympathetic cardiovascular influences to the arteries and the kidneys, namely the potentiation of the peripheral vasoconstrictor drive and the enhancement of the renal sodium reabsorption process.3,4,10,35PerspectivesSome limitations and strengths of the current meta-analysis merit to be mentioned. The first limitation, which is shared by all the meta-analytic investigations, includes the fact that the evaluation we did depends on the number, size, and design of the various studies included in the analysis, and this may have potentially affected to some extent the results. The second limitation refers to the fact that comparisons were made without correction for multiple testing, not excluding the possibility that some of the differences may be because of chance. A third limitation refers to the fact that there is some heterogeneity in the included studies about the number of patients, their age, and duration of hypertension, which may have potentially affected the meta-analysis results. Finally, although the presence of a chronic heart failure state concomitant to RHT was an exclusion criterion common to all the studies included in the meta-analysis, based on the clinical and instrumental evidence, the presence of a low-grade heart failure state cannot be entirely ruled out.The strengths are represented by the fact that the number of studies and of the patients included in the meta-analysis makes the present evaluation one of the largest never done before assessing the role of sympathetic neural factors in RHT development and progression. The clinical implication refers to the evidence that the marked sympathetic activation detected in RHT may participate in the elevated cardiovascular risk profile of this hypertensive phenotype and strengthens the need to counteract the neuroadrenergic activation with pharmacological and device-based therapeutic interventions.9 As far as the latter is concerned, it should be worth mentioning that 2 recent meta-analyses performed by our group have conclusively documented the sympathoinhibitory effects exerted by bilateral renal nerves ablation and carotid baroreceptor stimulation in the RHT phenotype.36,37Article InformationSources of FundingNone.DisclosuresNone.Supplemental MaterialTables S1–S4Figure S1"}

Physician–patient sex concordance may also contribute to better patient outcomes. However, other studies have not identified a significant difference. There is a paucity of pooled evidence examining the association of physician sex with clinical outcomes.MethodsThis random-effects meta-analysis was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines and prospectively registered on PROSPERO. MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched from inception to October 4th, 2023, and supplemented by a hand-search of relevant studies. Observational studies enrolling adults (≥ 18 years of age) and assessing the effect of physician sex across surgical and medical specialties were included. The risk of bias was assessed using ROBINS-I. A priori subgroup analysis was conducted based on patient type (surgical versus medical). All-cause mortality was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included complications, hospital readmission, and length of stay.ResultsAcross 35 (n = 13,404,840) observational studies, 20 (n = 8,915,504) assessed the effect of surgeon sex while the remaining 15 (n = 4,489,336) focused on physician sex in medical/anesthesia care. Fifteen studies were rated as having a moderate risk of bias, with 15 as severe, and 5 as critical. Mortality was significantly lower among patients of female versus male physicians (OR 0.95; 95% CI: 0.93 to 0.97; PQ = 0.13; I2 = 26%), which remained consistent among surgeon and non-surgeon physicians (Pinteraction = 0.60). No significant evidence of publication bias was detected (PEgger = 0.08). There was significantly lower hospital readmission among patients receiving medical/anesthesia care from female physicians (OR 0.97; 95% CI: 0.96 to 0.98). In a qualitative synthesis of 9 studies (n = 7,163,775), patient-physician sex concordance was typically associated with better outcomes, especially among female patients of female physicians.ConclusionsPatients treated by female physicians experienced significantly lower odds of mortality, along with fewer hospital readmissions, versus those with male physicians. Further work is necessary to examine these effects in other care contexts across different countries and understand underlying mechanisms and long-term outcomes to optimize health outcomes for all patients.Review registrationPROSPERO – CRD42023463577.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12913-025-12247-1.", "body": "BackgroundA growing body of literature has suggested an association between physician sex and patient outcomes across medical and surgical specialties, including the quality of care, mortality, and length of stay (LOS) [1–4]. A number of studies have demonstrated that female physicians are more likely to follow medical guidelines, offer patient-centred care, provide more preventive care, and exhibit better communication skills [5, 6]. These practices have been postulated to underpin observations that patients treated by female physicians may experience lower odds of mortality and hospital readmission versus male physicians [7, 8]. At the same time, several studies have suggested no significant associations between physician sex and patient outcomes [1, 8–11].It has also been suggested that patient-physician sex discordance is associated with worse outcomes, especially among female patients [2, 9, 12]. However, there is a more limited consensus on the outcomes of male patients. The underlying mechanisms may include less attention to the severity or different interpretation of symptoms in female patients by male physicians [13], more time spent with patients and better communication skills that could increase rapport [14], lower postoperative pain reporting by patients to male physicians [15, 16], and female patient discomfort for sensitive examinations [2, 17].To date, there is a paucity of pooled evidence examining the association of physician sex with clinical outcomes in both the medical and surgical setting. Hence, given the mixed findings of prior observational studies, our primary objective was to determine the association between physician sex and outcomes of patients across all medical and surgical specialties by conducting a comprehensive meta-analysis on the topic. Our secondary objective aimed to summarize the relationship between physician–patient sex concordance and patient outcomes.MethodsEligibility criteriaThis review was prospectively registered on PROSPERO (CRD42023463577) and conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses framework (PRISMA; Fig. 1, ESM 1 Table 1) [18]. The inclusion criteria consisted of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or observational studies enrolling adults (≥ 18) investigating the effect of physician sex and/or physician–patient sex concordance on patient outcomes. Patients across the spectrum of medical and surgical care, as well as physicians from all specialties, were included. No relevant RCTs were identified. Non-English language publications were excluded, consistent with prior literature demonstrating limited impact on effect estimates and conclusions [19].\nFig. 1PRISMA flow diagramThe primary outcome was short-term, all-cause mortality. Studies reporting in-hospital or 30-day mortality were pooled, consistent with the prior literature demonstrating no difference [20, 21]. Secondarily, we examined complications, hospital readmission, and LOS, as defined by individual study investigators.Literature search and selectionSearches were conducted by a medical librarian across MEDLINE and EMBASE from inception up to October 4th, 2023. The search strategies are outlined in ESM 1 Tables 2–3. We supplemented this with a hand-search of the bibliographies of relevant studies. The abstract and full-text screening was conducted by KH, AC, and HM through Covidence [22]. Relevant data including study design, author names, year of publication, country of origin, patient type, sample size, and outcomes of interest were extracted using sheets developed a priori. Screening and extraction were conducted independently and in duplicate. All disagreements were resolved through consensus and discussion with senior authors.Risk of biasWe assessed the risk of bias (ROB) using the Risk Of Bias In Non-Randomized Studies-of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool for observational studies [23]. None of the included studies were RCTs and therefore, the use of the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for Randomized Trials (RoB-2) was not indicated [24]. Publication bias was assessed using Egger’s test and visualized through contoured funnel plots when more than 10 studies were pooled for a given outcome [25].Statistical analysisWe conducted random-effects meta-analyses using the meta 4.18 library in R 3.6.3 [26]. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) were calculated with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Studies reporting proportions were converted into odds ratios and pooled with other studies reporting odds ratios only. Those reporting odds ratios for male physicians were converted to odds ratios for female physicians, prior to pooling. Studies that could not be pooled and did not have an author response and/or had unavailable data were described narratively. The Mantel–Haenszel and inverse variance methods were used for estimating study weight [27]. Heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran’s Q with a significance threshold of PQ < 0.10 as recommended by the Cochrane guidelines [27]. Heterogeneity was further quantified using I2 [27]. The I2 is a measure of inconsistency between the included studies for a given outcome, with an I2 of < 25% interpreted as low, 25 to 75% as moderate, and > 75% as high [27]. The results were visualized using forest plots.Subgroup/sensitivity analysisPre-planned subgroup analyses were considered based on patient types (surgical versus medical/anesthesia) and on surgical acuity (elective versus emergent) for patients undergoing surgery. However, given the limited number of studies across individual outcomes, we elected to forego subgroup analysis based on surgical acuity. An interaction test was conducted to determine the presence of significant subgroup differences [27]. As Jerath et al. [28] was the only study which focused on anesthesiology, sensitivity analysis was conducted, post hoc, by removing the results from the medical/anesthesia cohort. Bouchgoul et al. [29] and Kobylianskii et al. [30] reported risk ratios, and therefore, we conducted sensitivity analyses by including the unadjusted proportions to derive odds ratios. Chapman et al. [31] reported 30-day patient complication rates based on death or readmission secondary to complications stemming from surgery, and therefore, we conducted a sensitivity analysis excluding these results. Finally, given the inclusion of studies across different continents, we conducted post hoc subgroup analyses based on the geographical location of the study cohorts (North America versus other continents) for the primary outcome of mortality given the limited sample sizes among other outcomes.Patient and public involvementWhile we recognize the importance of patient and public involvement, this research was an analysis of existing literature, and as such, their involvement was not practical.ResultsScreeningWe identified 3,019 unique citations from systematic literature searches and 6 from hand searches (Fig. 1). Of these, 54 total full-texts were reviewed, 35 [1, 2, 7–12, 28–54] studies (n = 13,404,840) met the inclusion criteria, and data from 30 [1, 7–11, 28–43, 46, 48–54] (n = 9,214,223) were included in the meta-analysis.Characteristics of included studiesThe characteristics of the 35 [1, 2, 7–12, 28–48] included studies (n = 13,404,840) are tabulated in Table 1. All studies were observational, with 2 [29, 51] studies (n = 22,503) being prospective, 3 [1, 7, 8] studies (n = 2,669,667) having a cross-sectional design, and the remainder [2, 9–12, 28, 30–51, 53, 54] (n = 10,712,670) being retrospective cohort studies. The majority of studies focused on patients receiving surgical care (20 studies [1–3, 10, 11, 29–36, 40–43, 45, 53, 54]; n = 8,915,504), including general, cardiac, orthopedic, obstetric/gynecologic, and ophthalmologic surgery. Of the 15 [7–9, 12, 28, 37–39, 46–48] (n = 4,489,336) medical/anesthesia studies, 12 [7–9, 37–39, 46–48, 50–52] focused on general internal medicine or subspecialty internal medicine, 2 [12, 49] focused on emergency medicine and Jerath et al. [28] examined patients undergoing anesthesia for common surgeries. Nineteen [1, 2, 7–9, 11, 12, 28, 30–34, 42, 44, 45, 48, 50, 52] studies included patients receiving care in North America, 9 [29, 36, 38, 43, 46, 47, 51, 53, 54] in Europe, and 7 [10, 35, 37, 39–41, 49] in Asia. Fifteen studies [1, 8, 9, 12, 21, 28–30, 32, 36, 40, 42, 44, 45, 52] were rated as having a moderate ROB, 15 studies [7, 10, 11, 31, 33–35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 46, 47, 49, 51] were rated as severe, and 5 [38, 48, 50, 53, 54] as critical (ESM 1 Table 4). The main threat to internal validity was the risk of confounding.\nTable 1Study and patient characteristicsStudy IdentifierYearCountryStudy DesignData Source, YearsPatient TypeSample

Eleven studies were rated as having a severe ROB, 7 rated as moderate, and 3 as critical (ESM 1 Table 4). Patients treated by female versus male physicians had significantly lower mortality (OR 0.95; 95% CI: 0.93 to 0.97).

This effect remained significant across the 12 studies (N = 6,719,608) which included data from North America (OR 0.95; 95% CI: 0.93 to 0.97; ESM 1 Fig. 3). While there were no significant subgroup interactions (Pinteraction = 0.72), the effect size was no longer significant among the 9 studies (N = 497,782) from other continents (OR 0.93; 95% CI: 0.83 to 1.03; ESM 1 Fig. 3). The data from individual studies are summarized in ESM 2.\nComplicationsEleven [9, 11, 28–32, 41, 43, 53, 54] studies (n = 3,264,051) reported complications, of which 9 [11, 29–32, 41, 43] enrolled patients undergoing surgery and 2 [9, 28] included those receiving medical/anesthesia care (Fig. 3). Six studies were rated as having severe ROB, with the other 5 rated as moderate. There was no significant difference in complications among patients of female versus male physicians (OR 0.97; 95% CI: 0.94 to 1.01). There was non-significant, moderate heterogeneity across studies (PQ = 0.10; I2 = 37%). There was no evidence of publication bias (PEgger = 0.62; ESM 1 Fig. 4).\nFig. 3Complications forest plot. Abbreviations: OR – Odds ratio; SE – Standard error; CI – Confidence intervalThere were no significant subgroup differences between care settings (Pinteraction = 0.43; Fig. 3). The findings remained non-significant across both subgroups and following sensitivity analyses (ESM 1 Figs. 5–7). The data from individual studies are summarized in ESM 2.Hospital readmissionTen [7, 8, 28, 32, 37–40, 46] studies (n = 2,811,110) reported hospital readmission, of which 3 [32, 36, 40] included surgical patients and 7 [7, 8, 28, 37–39, 46] enrolled those receiving medical/anesthesia care (Fig. 4). Five studies were rated as having moderate, 4 as severe, and 1 as critical ROB (ESM 1 Table 4). There was no significant difference in readmission among patients of female versus male physicians (OR 1.01; 95% CI: 0.86 to 1.19). There was significant, high heterogeneity across studies (PQ < 0.01; I2 = 79%). There was no evidence of publication bias (PEgger = 0.36; ESM 1 Fig. 8).Fig. 4Hospital readmission forest plot. Abbreviations: OR – Odds ratio; SE – Standard error; CI – Confidence interval Despite non-significant (Pinteraction = 0.43) subgroup differences, there were significantly fewer hospital readmissions among female physicians when compared with male physicians (OR 0.97; 95% CI: 0.96 to 0.98; Fig. 4) in the medical/anesthesia subgroup. There were no significant differences across the surgical subgroup (Fig. 4) and the findings remained consistent following the sensitivity analysis (ESM 1 Fig. 9). The data from individual studies are summarized in ESM 2.Hospital length of stay (LOS)Seven [8, 11, 28, 32, 33, 43, 52] studies (n = 1,726,353) reported hospital LOS, of which 4 [11, 32, 33, 43] enrolled surgical patients and 3 [8, 28, 52] included those receiving medical/anesthesia care (ESM 1 Fig. 10). An additional study by Berg et al. [46] (n = 11,059) reported on LOS which could not be pooled. Four studies were rated as having severe ROB, with the remaining 4 rated as moderate (ESM 1 Table 4). Overall, there was no significant difference in hospital LOS among patients of female versus male physicians (OR 0.97; 95% CI: 0.90 to 1.04). There was significant, high heterogeneity across studies (PQ < 0.01; I2 = 91%).There were no significant subgroup differences between care settings (Pinteraction = 0.36) and the findings remained non-significant among both subgroups (ESM 1 Fig. 10). Following sensitivity analysis by excluding Jerath et al. (N = 1,165,711) [28], medical patients (N = 183,008) treated by female physicians had significantly higher LOS (OR 1.03; 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.06; ESM 1 Fig. 11). The data from individual studies are summarized in ESM 2.Physician–patient sex concordanceNine [2, 9, 12, 42, 44, 45, 47, 48] studies (n = 7,163,775) reported on sex concordance, of which 4 [2, 42, 44, 45] enrolled surgical patients and 5 [9, 12, 47–49] included patients receiving medical/anesthesia care (Table 1). Three [44, 45, 48] studies specifically looked at the effect of care team sex concordance on patient outcomes. Seven studies were rated as having a moderate ROB with 2 rated as severe (ESM 1 Table 4).Wallis et al. [2] (n = 1,320,108) found that, among female patients, sex discordance translated to significantly higher mortality versus sex concordance (aOR 1.32; 95% CI: 1.14 to 1.54) in Canadian health datasets. Conversely, among male patients, sex discordance resulted in lower odds of mortality (aOR 0.87; 95% CI: 0.78 to 0.97). Similarly, another study [42] (n = 2,732,565), using American Medicare data, found that patient-surgeon sex concordance was associated with lower mortality for female patients (adjusted risk difference [aRD] −0.15 pp; 95% CI: −0.32 to −0.05 pp), but higher mortality for male patients (aRD 0.24 pp; 95% CI: 0.08 to 0.40 pp). Greenwood et al. [12] (n = 581,845) found that female patients treated by male physicians had lower mean survival than male patients treated by male physicians (matched n = 119,304; mean [SD] 0.852 [0.355] versus 0.874 [0.332]) across American emergency departments. This discrepancy was less pronounced among male and female patients with female physicians (matched n = 15,122; male patient/female physician 0.872 [0.334] versus female patient/female physician 0.869 [0.338]). Conversely, Yelavarthy et al. [9] (n = 239,422) and Dziewierz et al. [47] (n = 581,744) showed no significant association between proceduralist-patient sex concordance and mortality. Sagy et al. [49] (N = 831) also found no significant association between physician–patient sex concordance and in-hospital or longer-term mortality. The data on other outcomes are outlined in ESM 2.DiscussionMain findingsAcross the 35 included studies [1, 2, 7–12, 28–48, 53, 54] (n = 13,404,840), of which 30 [1, 7–11, 28–43, 46, 48–54] (n = 9,214,223) were included in the meta-analysis, there was significantly lower odds of mortality among patients of female versus male physicians (OR 0.95; 95% CI: 0.93 to 0.97), an effect which was consistent across surgical and medical/anesthesia care. Fewer studies evaluated complications, hospital readmission, and LOS. In general, these analyses did not demonstrate significant differences based on physician sex, apart from lower odds of hospital readmission identified among patients receiving medical/anesthesia care from female versus male physicians (OR 0.97; 95% CI: 0.96 to 0.98). A systematic review of 9 [2, 9, 12, 42, 44, 45] studies (n = 7,163,775), revealed that physician and patient sex concordance was typically associated with better patient outcomes, especially among females managed by female physicians.Findings in contextWhile this study represents, to the best of our knowledge, one of the first quantitative meta-analysis assessing the association between physician sex and patient outcomes, our findings align with prior observational studies [1, 2, 4, 32]. Specifically, we found significantly lower mortality among patients of female versus male physicians, which remained consistent among patients receiving surgical and medical/anesthesia care. Other studies which also reported similar findings generally had larger sample sizes [1, 2, 32] with smaller studies reporting no difference with wide confidence intervals. Of note, many of these larger studies with positive findings analyzed cohorts from North America. Our analyses revealed that while the significantly lower mortality among patients of females persisted across studies from North America, there was no significant difference when pooling data from other continents, despite no significant subgroup interactions. It is unknown whether there are regional and cultural differences in factors such as patient-physician relationships, expectations, and communication styles that may affect the generalizability of our findings that were largely seen in studies from North America. We are unable to infer any regional differences given the variability in data sources, and fewer number of studies from other continents that may have led to decreased power in our analyses. There were also potentially fewer female physicians represented in the study cohort; however, the full details of unique physician composition were not consistently present. Therefore, larger prospective studies from various countries are required to confirm these findings.Several underlying mechanisms have been suggested for these findings. Specifically, female physicians have been shown to adhere more closely to clinical guidelines and offer more evidence-based care [5, 6]. Prior publications have also suggested that this difference may be attributable to better communication skills and a greater willingness to work with the interprofessional team when compared to male physicians [55]. Female physicians have also been shown to exhibit more risk-averse decision-making [17, 55], which may influence patient selection for surgery. Some studies have also reported better scores and skill acquisition among female versus male medical students [56, 57]. We found significantly lower hospital readmission among medical/anesthesia patients managed by female physicians which is consistent with prior observational studies [7, 28, 37]. There were no differences among those receiving surgical care; however, only 3 studies [32, 36, 40] reported readmission among this subgroup. We also did not find any significant difference in complications or hospital LOS. There have been fewer observational studies reporting on these outcomes and further study is required to determine whether a significant association exists.With respect to patient-physician sex concordance, while there is evidence that overall sex discordance is associated with worse outcomes, female patients tend to experience better outcomes with female physicians versus when treated by male physicians. However, the differences in outcomes for male patients are smaller. The underlying mechanisms may include less attention to the severity or different interpretation of symptoms in female patients by male physicians [13], more time spent with patients and better communication skills that could increase rapport [14], lower postoperative pain reporting by patients to male physicians [15, 16], and female patient discomfort for sensitive examinations [2, 17]. There is also limited evidence on the effect of surgeon-anesthesiologist sex concordance on patient outcomes, with one study reporting no significant difference [45] and another noting lower 1-year mortality among those treated by sex-discordant surgeon-anesthesiologist teams [44]. In the latter, they note that sex discordance among teams (i.e. surgeon’s sex differing from most of the team) may result in better teamwork in the OR, regardless of specific sex. Future studies should continue to investigate underlying explanations, including an approach that considers intersectionality. Additionally, future investigations should involve patient perspectives in study design, as well as data interpretation and implications to better understand potential mechanisms and interventions for the associations between physician sex and patient outcomes.Strengths & limitationsThis systematic review and meta-analysis is among the first, to our knowledge, to quantitatively evaluate the effect of physician sex on the outcomes of adult patients receiving medical or surgical management. In addition, we analyzed medical and surgical studies separately and in combination, as determined a priori, to explain possible sources of heterogeneity and improve the applicability of our findings.Despite the strength of these data, our systematic review noted several limitations in the published literature. Most of the studies were retrospective with many having a severe risk of bias due to the potential for residual confounding, despite adjustment in select studies. While we attempted to conduct several sensitivity analyses, the relatively large proportion of studies with high risk of bias precluded us from conducting analyses without their inclusion. Many studies also utilized large databases and diagnosis codes to ascertain physician and patient characteristics, introducing a risk of misclassification. Although databases are excellent resources to capture healthcare interactions, they vary in patient cohorts captured, access to different healthcare, and accuracy of codes that could impact data accuracy and generalizability [58, 59]. Additionally, while prior studies have demonstrated no difference when pooling in-hospital and 30-day mortality [20, 21], the included studies also often reported on the other outcomes of interest at different time points. Observational studies tend to overestimate effect sizes demonstrating benefit, as well [60]. Furthermore, there was a limited number of studies across outcomes other than mortality. This may have affected our ability to detect significant associations, as well as subgroup differences between patient types. Specifically, while surgery represents around 29% of overall care, a larger proportion of the pooled studies investigated the outcomes of patients undergoing surgery [61]. This highlights the need for more studies among those receiving non-surgical management. The literature has also often focused on biological sex as a binary variable, with more limited data on gender. In our analyses, we also found significant heterogeneity among studies that was not fully explained by additional analyses. Additionally, only studies published in English were included; however, prior literature suggests no meaningful effect on pooled estimates or conclusions [19]. We conducted extensive systematic and hand searching, and Egger’s test did not reveal any significant publication bias. Studies reporting on physician–patient sex concordance could not be pooled given the limited sample size and heterogeneous reporting.ConclusionPatients treated by female physicians experienced lower mortality, and those receiving medical/anesthesia care from female physicians experienced fewer hospital readmissions versus male physicians. Physician–patient sex concordance was also associated with better patient outcomes, especially among female patients. Further work is necessary to examine these effects in other care contexts across different countries, as well as to understand underlying mechanisms and long-term outcomes to better inform healthcare strategies and patient care.Supplementary Information\nSupplementary Material 1.Supplementary Material 2."}

Therefore, we performed a systematic search and meta-analysis to quantify the impact of AF on exercise tolerance (peak oxygen uptake, VO2peak; primary outcome) and exercise haemodynamics (secondary outcomes) in patients with HF.Methods and resultsPubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were systematically searched for articles from inception to June 2024. Studies were included if they: (i) examined participants with HF; (ii) compared participants with AF to those not in AF (i.e. sinus rhythm); (iii) measured VO2peak from expired gas analysis. A fixed effects meta-analysis was performed, with groups compared using the weighted average effect size, represented as the weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).

This highlights the importance of combined strategies to identify and manage AF in individuals with HF.", "body": "IntroductionReduced exercise tolerance and impaired haemodynamic function are seminal features of the heart failure (HF) syndrome.1 There is increasing awareness that comorbidities such as atrial fibrillation (AF) contribute strongly to symptoms, functional limitations, and clinical outcomes in individuals with HF1—including HF with reduced (HFrEF) and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Atrial fibrillation is present in approximately 20–65% of patients with HF,2 making it the most common arrhythmia and particularly in older populations—a major HF comorbidity.1,2 This reflects shared risk factors and pathophysiology between the two conditions2,3 and the bi-directional impact of each condition on the other.1,3 As a result, there is a growing understanding that patients with both HF and AF may have a distinct HF subtype.1 However, the phenotypic features underlying the combined impact of HF and AF have not been definitively established.1Therefore, we performed a systematic search and meta-analysis to quantify the impact of AF on crucial features of the HF syndrome, specifically exercise tolerance (measured objectively as peak oxygen uptake, VO2peak) and exercise haemodynamics.MethodsData sources and search strategyPubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were systematically searched to find articles published from inception to June 2024. Our search strategy focused on three key terms: (i) heart failure, (ii) atrial fibrillation, and (iii) cardiopulmonary exercise test (see Supplementary material online, Methods for full search terms). Additionally, we manually searched the reference lists of included studies using Google Scholar.Articles identified from these databases were imported into the Covidence review management software (Melbourne, Australia). Initial screening involved screening titles and abstracts, followed by a full-text review against predefined inclusion criteria by two researchers (M.J.H., V.S.) with conflicts resolved by another independent researcher (S.J.F.). Following study inclusion, the relevant data of all included studies were extracted independently by the two researchers (M.J.H., V.S.) for synthesis. No ethical approval was required for this study since all data were sourced from previously published studies and did not involve any personally identifiable information.Study selection criteriaOnly studies were included that: (i) examined participants with HF; (ii) compared subjects with AF with non-AF (i.e. sinus rhythm, SR); (iii) measured VO2peak from expired gas analysis. The exclusion criteria were: (i) no original or duplicate data; (ii) no HF; (iii) no SR comparator group; (iv) non-human cohorts (i.e animal models); (v) non-English studies; and (vi) no peak exercise data.Study quality assessmentStudy quality and risk of bias were evaluated using the AXIS appraisal tool—a validated 20-point tool designed to assess the quality of cross-sectional studies (a maximum score of 20 indicates the highest quality).4Data synthesis and analysisA meta-analysis was conducted using the R metacont package (R Core Team, 2016, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) to compare differences in primary and secondary outcomes between patients with HF and AF (HF-AF) and those with non-Afib/SR (HF-SR). Fixed effects models were used to analyse the data. The weighted average effect size, represented as the weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), was calculated for each outcome. Study weights were determined by the inverse of the variance within each study, with larger studies receiving higher weights due to their larger sample sizes. Heterogeneity was assessed using I2 and τ2 statistics. Forest plots were generated to visualize individual effect sizes, standard deviations, and the corresponding P-values (alpha = 0.05).ResultsIncluded studiesAfter removal of duplicate studies, 573 studies were reviewed against the inclusion criteria (Figure 1), with 16 studies included (Table 1) 5–20 comparing VO2peak with or without exercise haemodynamics in HF-AF (n = 1,271, 68% male, age: 66.5 years, resting LVEF: 41.2%) or HF-SR (n = 4910; 62% male, age: 62.4 years, resting LVEF: 40.8%). Cohorts included HFrEF only, HFpEF only, or a combination of HF sub-types (Table 1). Peak oxygen uptake was assessed from a treadmill test in five studies, upright cycling in five studies, supine cycling in two studies, and a combination of either treadmill or supine cycling in four studies.Figure 1PRISMA diagram outlining the outcomes for the identification and screening of studies to be included in the meta-analysis.Table 1Clinical, demographic and methodologic data for included studiesAuthor, yearHF-phenotypeGroupNo./sexAgeLVEFRate control medicationsCPET mode\nBeta-blocker\n\nDigoxin\n\nAmiodarone\n Pardaens, 19975HFrEFHF-AF18 males53 years21%11%89%\nNR\nCYC (UR)HF-SR93 males50 years23%15%67%\nNR\nPozzoli, 19986HFrEFHF-AF14 males, 4 females54 years24%\nNR\n\nNR\n\nNR\nTMHF-SR255 males, 35 females54 years23%\nNR\n\nNR\n\nNR\nParthenakis, 20077HFrEFHF-AF29 males, 11 females63 years27%68%55%15%TMHF-SR79 males, 28 females57 years30%71%21%15%Agostoni, 20088Mixed (HFrEF + HFpEF)HF-AF148 males, 32 females63 years31%64%20%18%CYC (UR) or TMHF-SR565 males, 197 females58 years32%70%29%23%Waldenhjort, 20099HFrEFHF-AF26 males, 15 females74 years39%68%68%NRCYC (UR)HF-SR18 males, 8 females73 years31%46%27%NRZakeri, 201410HFpEFHF-AF47 males, 32 females73 years59%80%23%1%CYC (UR) or TMHF-SR57 males, 67 females66 years63%73%2%6%Palmero, 201611HFrEFHF-AF11 males, 4 females64 years36%100%13%20%CYC (UR)HF-SR11 males, 7 females63 years33%94%0%44%Abreu, 201712HFrEFHF-AF28 males, 7 females71 years27%NRNRNRTMHF-SR41 males, 25 females67 years26%NRNRNRElshazly, 201713HFpEFHF-AF154 males, 85 females59 years58%69%21%NRCYC (UR) or TMHF-SR875 males, 630 females50 years60%61%5%NRKaye, 201714Mixed (HFmrEF + HFpEFa)HF-AF20 males/females69 years46%65%35%NRCYC (supine)HF-SR35 male/females70 years48%63%3%NRLam, 201715HFpEFHF-AF12 males, 20 females74 years56%81%NRNRTMHF-SR16 males, 46 females73 years58%79%NRNRLuo, 201716HFrEFHF-AF382 males, 61 females63 years24%91%54%85%CYC (UR) or TMHF-SR1602 males, 537 females57 years25%95%41%81%Gonçalves, 202017HFrEFHF-AF45 males, 6 females58 years26%78%NRNRTMHF-SR162 males, 61 females53 years29%80%NRNRReddy, 202018HFpEFHF- AF19 males, 29 females75 years61%75%23%NRCYC (supine)HF-SR69 males, 112 females66 years64%51%1%NRChuda, 202119Mixed (HFrEF + HFpEF)HF-AF23 males/females67 years41%87%NRNRCYC (UR)HF-SR23 males/females67 years46%87%NRNRPalau, 202320HFpEFHF-AF30 males, 38 females73 years67%88%4%NRCYC (UR)HF-SR28 males, 37 females74 years66%89%5%NRData are presented as mean unless otherwise specified.AF, atrial fibrillation; CPET, cardiopulmonary exercise testing; CYC, cycling; HF, heart failure; LVEF, left ventricular ejection fraction; SR, sinus rhythm; TM, treadmill; UR, upright.\naHF-phenotype redefined according to the current guidelines (HFrEF ≤40% EF, HFmrEF 40–49% EF, HFpEF ≥50% EF)21.Peak oxygen uptakeBody weight-indexed VO2peak was significantly lower in patients with HF-AF (14.01 mL/kg/min) compared with HF-SR (15.72 mL/kg/min; WMD: −1.55 mL/kg/min, 95% CI: −1.81 to −1.28 mL/kg/min, I2 = 83%, n = 6471; Figure 2A).

Meta-regression analysis showed no relationship between the mean resting left ventricular ejection fraction for each study and the MD for VO2peak in HF-AF (ß = −0.05, 95% CI: −0.19 to 0.09, P = 0.479) vs. HF-SR (ß = −0.05, 95% CI: −0.19 to 0.09, P = 0.462). Peak power output (WMD: −12.63 W, 95% CI: −16.56 to −8.69, I2 = 0%, n = 1311; Supplementary material online, Figure S2B) was also significantly lower in HF with AF than in HF-SR.Figure 2Impact of AF status on VO2peak and exercise haemodynamics in individuals with heart failure.

HR, heart rate; VO2peak, peak oxygen uptake; O2pulse, oxygen pulse; HF-AF, heart failure with atrial fibrillation; HF-SR, heart failure with sinus rhythm.Exercise haemodynamicsThe lower VO2peak in HF-AF coincided with a marginally lower peak exercise heart rate (HR; WMD: −2.94 b/min, 95% CI: −4.76 to −1.13 b/min, I2 = 88%, n = 5115; Figure 2B) and a lower peak exercise O2pulse (WMD: −1.58 mL/beat, 95% CI: −1.90 to −1.26 mL/beat, I2 = 15%, n = 3049; Figure 2C). Peak exercise systolic blood pressure (SBP) was also lower in HF-AF relative to HF-SR (WMD: −11.11 mmHg, 95% CI: −14.01 to −8.21 mmHg, I2 = 69%, n = 2409; Supplementary material online, Figure S2). Only two studies14,18 measured stroke index, cardiac index, and arterio-venous oxygen difference (a-vO2diff), and so meta-analysis was not performed for these outcomes. In both studies, stroke index (MD: −12.00 mL/m2, 95% CI: −17.54 to −6.46 mL/m214; MD: −9.00 mL/m2; 95% CI: −13.33 to −4.67 mL/m218) and cardiac index (MD: −0.90 L/min/m2, 95% CI: −1.45 to −0.35 L/min/m214; MD: −1.40 L/min/m2, 95% CI: −1.76 to −1.04 L/min/m218) were significantly lower in HF-AF vs. HF-SR. The a−vO2diff was significantly higher in HF-AF in Reddy et al.18 (MD: 1.80 mL/dL, 95% CI: 1.16 to 2.44 mL/dL), but lower in HF-AF in the study of Kaye et al.14 (albeit not significant; MD: −1.50 mL/dL, 95% CI: −3.19 to 0.19 mL/dL).Study quality and risk of biasThe mean AXIS score of the included studies was 15.3 points, suggesting a moderate level of bias (see Supplementary material online, Table S1).DiscussionTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis to quantify the impact of AF on VO2peak and exercise haemodynamics in patients with HF. In doing so, we made two key findings: (i) AF exacerbates exercise limitations in HF, such that VO2peak was 1.6 mL/kg/min (∼12%) lower in HF-AF than HF-SR, and this difference was consistent across the LVEF spectrum; (ii) the lower VO2peak in individuals with HF-AF is not the result of peak HR differences (which was marginally lower in HF-AF), but is likely due to ventricular and/or peripheral impairments.The findings of our meta-analysis confirm that AF imposes additional and meaningful limitations to exercise tolerance beyond HF alone. Results from the HF-ACTION trial suggest the magnitude of VO2peak impairment in the HF-AF cohort (1.6 mL/kg/min lower) is clinically significant, as every 1.0 mL/kg/min decrement in VO2peak has been associated with an ∼15% increase in all-cause mortality.22 Moreover, the mean VO2peak values in both AF and SR groups were below the threshold for independent living23 (15–18 mL/kg/min), where even small decrements in VO2peak can result in basic daily activities (walking, carrying groceries) exceeding their maximum capacity. Taken together, the lower VO2peak in HF-AF provides an explanation for greater functional limitations, reduced quality of life and worse clinical outcomes in individuals with HF and AF.1 This highlights the importance of AF-targeted therapies in patients with HF. Specifically, rhythm control interventions such as AF ablation,24,25 and lifestyle interventions targeting risk factors for AF progression26,27 which are associated with improved exercise tolerance, haemodynamic function, and arrhythmia burden.By investigating the underlying mechanisms contributing to functional limitations in HF-AF, we demonstrated that the reduced VO2peak is not mediated by differences in peak HR, which was marginally lower (∼3.5 b.p.m. lower) in those with AF. Based on the Fick principle, this suggests that the lower VO2peak in HF-AF was primarily due to lower stroke volume (SV) and/or a-vO2diff. Unfortunately, there were insufficient studies to quantify either outcome in our meta-analysis. However, the two studies evaluating exercise SV responses reported stroke index and cardiac index were significantly lower in HF-AF vs. HF-SR.14,18 Moreover, the lower O2pulse (1.58 mL/beat or ∼15% lower) and peak SBP (∼10 mmHg lower) in the HF-AF cohorts suggest impairment in SV and/or a-vO2diff. The atrial mechanisms contributing to the lower SV could be impaired ventricular filling from the loss of atrial kick or beat-to-beat variations in filling time.1 Microvascular and skeletal muscle dysfunction may also decrease VO2peak in AF via their impact on the a-vO2diff and muscle oxygen diffusive conductance. Whilst pathophysiologic drivers of AF (e.g. chronic low-grade inflammation, hypertension1) could impair muscle-microvascular function, the two studies evaluating the a-vO2diff in HF-AF vs. HF-SR report conflicting results—reporting a-vO2diff is either higher in HF-AF18 (suggesting AF is primarily a cardiac limitation) or lower14 (suggesting a mixed cardiac-peripheral limitation). Therefore, further work is needed to understand the mechanisms contributing to decreased VO2peak in patients with HF and AF.Notable limitations include significant heterogeneity among the included studies, which may reflect differences in assessment modalities, AF and HF aetiology, rate control medications, and participant characteristics (e.g. age, sex). This variability may have influenced the pooled results and should be considered when interpreting the findings. We also cannot rule out that a subset of patients in the HF-SR cohorts may have paroxysmal AF and/or sub-clinical atrial myopathy that has not progressed to persistent or permanent AF. However, this would attenuate differences between the HF-AF and HF-SR cohorts. As noted above, there were also insufficient studies to quantify the impact of AF on key exercise haemodynamic measures. Additionally, as assessed by the AXIS tool, moderate bias exists in the included studies, which could impact the reliability and generalizability of the findings. Future research with standardized protocols and rigorous designs is needed to address these limitations.ConclusionsIn patients with HF across the spectrum of LVEF, AF is associated with clinically meaningful reductions in VO2peak, potentially due to reduced SV and/or arterio-venous oxygen difference. This association highlights the importance of identifying and managing major comorbidities such as AF in individuals with HF.Supplementary Materialoeaf003_Supplementary_Data"}

In light of recent studies, this meta‐analysis aimed to investigate the effect of SGLT2i on the prognosis of patients with ATTR‐CM.MethodsA comprehensive search of Medline, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library was conducted up to November 17, 2024. Study selection, data extraction and quality assessment were carried out independently by two investigators. Associations of SGLT2i with outcomes were pooled using random‐effects meta‐analyses.ResultsA total of five studies (9766 participants, 4 propensity score‐matched) were included. The use of SGLT2i was associated with significant reductions in all‐cause mortality [hazard ratio (HR) .54, 95% confidence interval (CI) .44–.66], cardiovascular mortality (HR .39, 95% CI .23–.65), major adverse cardiovascular events (HR .71, 95% CI .61–.83), and heart failure hospitalizations (HFHs) (HR .63, 95% CI .52–.77) compared to non‐use. The odds of cardiac arrhythmias were significantly lower among SGLT2i users compared to non‐users [odds ratio (OR) .73, 95% CI .65–.83].

The utility of conventional heart failure (HF) therapies in ATTR‐CM has been contentious, largely due to the exclusion of amyloid patients from traditional HF clinical trials.\n11\n Nevertheless, a large retrospective analysis of ATTR‐CM patients revealed lower all‐cause mortality among those receiving beta blockers (in cases of ejection fraction <40%) and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), highlighting a critical need for further investigation into the efficacy of standard HF treatments in this challenging patient population.\n11\n\nSodium‐glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have emerged as a class of cardio‐renal‐metabolic therapies, demonstrating significant benefits such as reducing hospitalizations for HF, enhancing cardiac function and slowing the progression of chronic kidney disease.\n12\n, \n13\n, \n14\n, \n15\n, \n16\n Despite these established advantages in broader cardiovascular and renal populations, their efficacy in ATTR‐CM remains insufficiently defined. Preliminary investigations suggest that SGLT2i are well‐tolerated in this patient cohort\n17\n, \n18\n; however, robust evidence regarding their therapeutic impact is lacking. Accordingly, this meta‐analysis sought to systematically evaluate the impact of SGLT2i on clinical outcomes in individuals diagnosed with ATTR‐CM.2MATERIALS AND METHODSThe study adhered to the guidelines specified in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews,\n19\n and was reported following the PRISMA 2020 standards for systematic reviews and meta‐analyses\n20\n (Table S1). The study protocol was registered a priori on the Open Science Network (10.17605/OSF.IO/5FT42), and no amendments were made to the original protocol thereafter.2.1Search strategyA comprehensive literature search was systematically conducted by two independent researchers across multiple databases, including MEDLINE (via PubMed), Scopus, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, covering all records from database inception through November 17, 2024. No limitations were applied concerning date, language, publication status, or year at the initial search stage. The primary search terms included “sglt2 inhibitor”, “all‐cause mortality”, “cardiovascular mortality”, “adverse cardiovascular events”, “hospitalization” and “arrhythmias” applied both as free‐text keywords and using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). Additional searches were carried out manually on ClinicalTrials.gov, the Epistemonikos database, and Google Scholar. Furthermore, backward and forward citation tracking was employed using the citationchaser package in R.\n21\n Detailed search strategies are provided in Tables S2–S4.2.2Eligibility criteria2.2.1Inclusion criteriaEligible studies included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or observational studies that examined the effects of SGLT2i on clinical outcomes in adults (aged 18 years or older) with ATTR‐CM.2.2.2Exclusion criteriaStudies with the following characteristics were excluded: (i) case reports, case series and narrative reviews; (ii) editorials, letters, commentaries and expert opinions; (iii) clinical practice guidelines, protocols and dissertations; (iv) studies reporting exclusively on laboratory markers or other surrogate outcomes; and (v) studies for which the full text was not retrievable.2.3OutcomesThe outcomes for meta‐analysis included all‐cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), heart failure hospitalizations (HHFs), and cardiac arrhythmias—including atrial fibrillation (AF), ventricular tachycardia (VT), and sudden cardiac arrest (SCA)—comparing SGLT2i users with non‐users.2.4Study SelectionIn the initial phase, two authors independently screened all titles and abstracts from records identified through the prespecified search strategy. To enhance the sensitivity of the study selection process, discrepancies at this stage did not result in exclusions. Subsequently, two investigators independently evaluated the full texts of potentially eligible studies. Any disagreements were resolved through consensus or, if necessary, by consulting a senior author. The screening process in the initial phase was facilitated by the Abstrackr tool,\n22\n while Mendeley was utilized for reference management.2.5Data extractionA data extraction form was developed and underwent a pilot phase using a subset of four studies. Following a series of training and calibration sessions, a standardized form for data extraction was finalized. Data extraction was conducted independently in duplicate, with any discrepancies resolved by consensus or, when necessary, by consulting a senior author. For each study, we extracted information on sample size, relevant clinical and demographic characteristics, and adjusted effect estimates for outcomes of interest, when such adjustments were available. Additionally, corresponding authors from the included studies were contacted to request supplementary information if data were missing or not explicitly provided in the published reports.2.6Quality assessmentTwo authors independently evaluated the quality of the identified studies using the Risk Of Bias In Non‐randomized Studies—of Interventions (ROBINS‐I) tool, which provides a systematic framework for assessing the risk of bias in observational epidemiological studies.\n23\n Any discrepancies during the assessment were resolved through discussion or, if necessary, by consulting a third author.2.7Data analysisAll analyses were conducted using R Statistical Software, version 4.2, utilizing the meta, package. Categorical variables are reported as frequencies and percentages (%), while continuous variables are presented as means with standard deviations (SDs) for normally distributed data, and as medians with interquartile ranges (IQR) for non‐normally distributed data. To estimate the relative effects between intervention and control groups, effect estimates and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using random‐effects pairwise models, employing the restricted maximum likelihood estimator for between‐study variance within a frequentist framework. Since Jaiswal et al.\n24\n did not provide hazard ratios (HRs) estimates, binomial data were converted to HR using established methods.\n25\n A two‐tailed p‐value of less than .05 was considered statistically significant for summary effect estimates. All analyses followed an intention‐to‐treat approach.The I\n2 statistic was calculated to assess the proportion of total variability due to between‐study heterogeneity, indicating the degree of inconsistency across studies. Additionally, heterogeneity was formally assessed using Cochran's Q test. Generally, thresholds of 25%, 50% and 75% are used to indicate low, moderate and high heterogeneity, respectively.\n26\n To evaluate small‐study effects and potential publication bias, contour‐enhanced funnel plots (plotting effect size against standard error) were used for visual assessment, with Egger's test providing a formal statistical evaluation.3RESULTS3.1Study selection and characteristicsThe PRISMA diagram detailing the database search and study selection process is provided in Figure 1. After duplicate records were removed, an initial set of 246 identified studies was screened by title and abstract. Of these, 189 studies were excluded. The remaining 57 studies underwent a thorough full‐text evaluation, resulting in the inclusion of 5 studies that satisfied the eligibility criteria.\n24\n, \n27\n, \n28\n, \n29\n, \n30\n\nFIGURE 1Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta‐analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram.In total, five studies (4 of which were propensity score‐matched), involving 9766 participants, were analysed. The median age was 77 (IQR: 76–79) years, and the median proportion of male participants was 81% (IQR: 76–89). The median left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 50% (IQR: 47–51). All studies accounted for disease‐modifying therapy (tafamidis or patisiran), with adjustments made either at the propensity score‐matching stage\n24\n, \n27\n, \n29\n, \n30\n or subsequently through regression.\n28\n The baseline characteristics of included studies are presented in Table 1.

SGLT2i users had a significantly lower risk of cardiovascular mortality compared to non‐users of SGLT2i (556 patients, HR .39, 95% CI .23–.65, p < .001; I\n2 = 0%, heterogeneity p = .47; Figure 3B).3.4MACEThree studies investigated the risk of MACE among SGLT2i users and non‐users. Based on the random effects meta‐analysis, the risk of MACE was 29% lower with SGLT2i treatment compared to no treatment (5682 patients, HR .71, 95% CI .61–.83, p < .001; I\n2 = 0%, heterogeneity p = .48; Figure 3C).3.5\nHF hospitalizationThe risk of HHF was reported in 4 studies involving 4746 participants. SGLT2i use significantly reduced the risk of HHF compared to non‐use (HR .63, 95% CI .52–.77, p < .001; I\n2 = 0%, heterogeneity p = .88; Figure 4).FIGURE 4Forest plots of pairwise meta‐analyses on the effects of sodium‐glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) on hospitalization for heart failure (HF). HR, hazard ratio; 95%‐CI, 95% confidence interval.3.6Cardiac arrhythmiasThree studies evaluated the impact of SGLT2i on cardiac arrhythmias involving 9210 ATTR‐CM patients. SGLT2i users had significantly lower odds of cardiac arrhythmias compared to non‐users (Odds ratio (OR) .73, 95% CI .65–.83, p < .001; I\n2 = 0%, heterogeneity p = .78; Figure 5). Specifically, the use of SGLT2i was associated with a significant reduction in the odds of AF (8274 patients, OR .75, 95% CI .62–.91, p < .001; I\n2 = 17%; Figure 5), VT (8274 patients, OR .72, 95% CI .59–.88, p < .001; I\n2 = 5%; Figure 5) and SCA (3968 patients, OR .71, 95% CI .50–.99, p < .001; Figure 5).FIGURE 5Forest plots of pairwise meta‐analyses on the effects of sodium‐glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) on cardiac arrhythmias. AF, atrial fibrillation; OR, odds ratio; SCA, sudden cardiac death; VT, ventricular tachycardia; 95%‐CI, 95% confidence interval.3.7Small study effects and publication biasNo evidence of small‐study effects (including publication bias) was detected, as indicated by symmetrical, contour‐enhanced funnel plots, suggesting minimal risk of bias in the pooled estimates (Figure S1).4DISCUSSIONThis is the first meta‐analysis to demonstrate that the use of SGLT2i may be associated with an improved survival and more favourable outcomes in patients with ATTR‐CM. Specifically, SGLT2i users had a 46% lower risk of all‐cause mortality, a 61% lower risk of cardiovascular mortality, and a 29% lower risk of MACE compared to non‐users. Additionally, SGLT2i use was associated with a 37% reduction in the risk of HF‐related hospitalization and a 27% reduction in the odds of cardiac arrhythmias compared to non‐use. This reduction translated into significantly lower odds of AF, VT and/or SCA. The majority of patients had symptomatic HF, with approximately 10%–20% classified as NYHA class I. Hence, additional research is necessary to determine whether the observed benefits were primarily due to the established effects of SGLT2i on HF or their potential role as disease‐modifying agents in ATTR‐CM.These findings align with previous analyses on the short‐term efficacy and safety of SGLT2i in patients with ATTR‐CM. In a retrospective cohort of 87 ATTR‐CM patients treated with SGLT2i, a median follow‐up of 6 months revealed significant improvements in the fluid status of these patients, demonstrated by reductions in weight, loop diuretic dose and uric acid levels.\n17\n The authors also noted a transient decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at 1 month post‐treatment initiation, though no sustained differences were observed in subsequent follow‐up.\n17\n Cardiac biomarkers showed no significant between‐group differences, and SGLT2i was generally well tolerated, with a discontinuation rate of 11.5%.\n17\n\nSimilarly, a retrospective analysis evaluating the tolerability and short‐term clinical outcomes of dapagliflozin in 17 ATTR‐CM patients treated with tafamidis reported that 76.5% of dapagliflozin‐treated patients had a decrease in NT‐proBNP at 3 months follow‐up, with stable disease parameters and no adverse events reported.\n18\n Another clinical feasibility study was conducted on 79 patients with ATTR‐CM who were treated with either dapagliflozin or empagliflozin.\n31\n In this cohort, urinary tract infections occurred in 5.1% of patients, with two individuals discontinuing SGLT2i therapy, and 2.5% experiencing mortality unrelated to SGLT2i use.\n31\n A mild decline in glomerular filtration rate was reported, while New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional status, cardiac and hepatic function and 6‐min walk distance remained stable over the study period, suggesting a potential role for SGLT2i in managing patients with amyloidosis and concurrent cardiac or renal dysfunction.\n31\n These data, together with the findings of the present study, support the notion that SGLT2i represent a potentially safe and effective treatment option for patients with ATTR‐CM.In a propensity score‐matched analysis of 220 patients with ATTR‐CM, Porcari et al. demonstrated significant benefits associated with SGLT2i therapy.\n27\n Patients receiving SGLT2i showed a reduced likelihood of worsening NYHA functional class over 12 months compared to untreated patients.\n27\n Additionally, SGLT2i treatment was linked to a slower progression of biomarker changes, including a reduced rate of NT‐proBNP increase and a slower decline in eGFR, after adjusting for baseline values.\n27\n No significant differences in systolic blood pressure were observed between treated and untreated groups.\n27\n Furthermore, SGLT2i therapy was associated with a marked reduction in the initiation of loop diuretics over 12 months among patients not requiring these agents at baseline.\n27\n\nATTR amyloidosis is strongly associated with renal impairment\n32\n and albuminuria.\n33\n Given the well‐documented link between kidney disease and an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes,\n34\n, \n35\n, \n36\n the renoprotective effects of SGLT2i are particularly significant in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with ATTR amyloidosis. Of note, a study involving 134 patients with ATTR‐CM revealed that the absence of SGLT2i therapy was a strong and independent predictor of kidney health, with SGLT2i use being associated with a 90% reduction in renal function decline.\n37\n Hence, the reduction in mortality and morbidity observed in this meta‐analysis among ATTR‐CM patients receiving SGLT2i could, in part, be mediated through the preservation of renal function associated with SGLT2i therapy in this population.Due to the structural and functional changes associated with transthyretin deposition (e.g., amyloid infiltration in the conduction system, atrial dilation secondary to diastolic dysfunction, etc.), arrhythmias are common in patients with ATTR‐CM. The management of these conditions is particularly challenging in this patient population due to high recurrence rates and the limited ability to fundamentally alter the disease course of ATTR‐CM.\n38\n, \n39\n, \n40\n, \n41\n, \n42\n The present meta‐analysis suggests that SGLT2i confer significant benefits for ATTR‐CM, including a substantial reduction in the odds of arrhythmias, ranging from AF to VT and SCA. Notably, the magnitude of this reduction appears greater than that observed in the general population receiving SGLT2i treatment,\n43\n, \n44\n potentially due to the higher baseline arrhythmia risk in the ATTR‐CM population. Notably, a recent meta‐analysis of 33 RCTs involving over 48,000 patients receiving SGLT2i treatment demonstrated a significant 22% reduction in the risk of AF, which is slightly lower than the 25% reduction observed in the present analysis, along with a marginally non‐significant effect on the risk of SCA.\n45\n\nThe observed benefits of SGLT2i in the present study appear comparable to those reported in RCTs evaluating tafamidis and acoramidis for the endpoints of all‐cause mortality and HF hospitalizations.\n6\n, \n7\n, \n8\n Notably, approximately 15%–20% of participants in our meta‐analysis were already receiving disease‐modifying treatments, suggesting that SGLT2i may confer additional benefit in this population. While the baseline characteristics of participants in our meta‐analysis were generally comparable to those in tafamidis and acoramidis trials with respect to age and diabetes prevalence, detailed comparisons for other variables, such as baseline chronic kidney disease were not possible due to a lack of pertinent data. It is also important to acknowledge inherent differences in the populations of the tafamidis and acoramidis trials, such as the percentage of patients with NYHA class II, which was 61.4% in the ATTR‐ACT trial (tafamidis) compared to 31.8% in the ATTRibute‐CM trial (acoramidis).\n6\n, \n7\n, \n8\n These variations highlight the heterogeneity across studies and the need for cautious interpretation when comparing treatments.4.1Strengths and limitationsSeveral limitations should be considered when interpreting the findings of this meta‐analysis. Residual confounding remains a potential issue, as unmeasured factors may influence the results. The generalizability of these findings to other forms of cardiac amyloidosis is limited. Baseline data on key variables, including disease severity and the dosage of loop diuretics, were unavailable, potentially impacting the analysis. Although propensity score matching was employed in the primary studies to reduce confounding, it is well recognized that this statistical approach does not consistently replicate results observed in RCTs. The effect sizes observed in this study are larger than those reported in trials involving non‐amyloid populations, likely reflecting an overestimation due to methodological factors, particularly given the relatively low number of events in this dataset.Despite propensity score matching, the possibility of unmeasured confounders cannot be entirely excluded, as this method does not fully account for all sources of bias. Furthermore, indication bias may have influenced SGLT2i treatment decisions, with some clinicians more inclined to prescribe these agents for patients with advanced disease, while others may have avoided them due to the lack of prior testing in ATTR‐CM populations. The inability to account for changes in clinical covariates between baseline and follow‐up, potentially linked to provider decisions, further limits the scope of the analysis.This study was also underpowered for meaningful subgroup analyses, restricting our ability to draw conclusions across different patient subgroups. Although the investigators of the primary studies attempted to mitigate immortal time bias by initiating patient observation from the date of diagnosis rather than treatment initiation, this potential bias warrants consideration. Lastly, the findings of this analysis should be regarded as hypothesis‐generating. Confirmation through well‐designed, prospective, randomized, placebo‐controlled trials in contemporary ATTR‐CM cohorts receiving disease‐modifying therapies is essential to validate these results.5CONCLUSIONSThe use of SGLT2is may be associated with a more favourable prognosis in patients with ATTR‐CM. This benefit appears to translate into lower rates of all‐cause and cardiovascular mortality, MACE, HHF and cardiac arrhythmias, including AF, VT and SCA. Further research, particularly adequately powered, long‐term RCTs, is required to validate and strengthen the existing observational evidence.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nPaschalis Karakasis: conceptualization, methodology, investigation, visualization, project administration, writing—original draft, writing—review and editing.

This study employs a Mendelian randomization (MR) approach to investigate the potential causal relationship between mitochondrial proteins and AA. Genetic instruments for mitochondrial proteins were obtained from the IEU Open genome-wide association study database, while AA-related genetic data were sourced from the FinnGen biobank. Inverse-variance weighting (IVW) served as the primary MR method, with MR-Egger and weighted median approaches utilized as complementary methods. Sensitivity analyses, including Cochran Q test, MR-Egger intercept, and MR-PRESSO, were performed to assess heterogeneity and pleiotropy. Reverse MR analysis was conducted to exclude the possibility of reverse causation. To enhance the robustness of the findings, replication was carried out using genome-wide association study Catalog data, and a meta-analysis was performed by integrating discovery and replication datasets. Gene expression validation was conducted using the Gene Expression Omnibus dataset, and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was applied to explore relevant biological pathways. Additionally, in vitro experiments employing platelet-derived growth factor-BB-induced human aortic smooth muscle cells were performed to validate the expression patterns of mitochondrial-related proteins at both mRNA and protein levels. Through rigorous genetic variant selection, MR analysis using IVW, sensitivity analyses, replication, and meta-analysis, we identified iron–sulfur cluster assembly enzyme (ISCU), 39S ribosomal protein L14 (MRPL14), and mitochondrial peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase (MSRA) as mitochondrial proteins associated with AA. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of these findings, with no evidence of heterogeneity or pleiotropy. Reverse MR analysis ruled out reverse causation. Gene expression analysis demonstrated that ISCU was significantly upregulated, whereas MRPL14 and MSRA were downregulated in AA tissues. GSEA revealed that these proteins are involved in pathways related to inflammation, immune response, and vascular remodeling. In vitro experiments further corroborated these findings, demonstrating consistent expression patterns in platelet-derived growth factor-BB-induced human aortic smooth muscle cells. This study provides robust genetic and experimental evidence supporting the causal role of ISCU, MRPL14, and MSRA in AA pathogenesis. These mitochondrial proteins may serve as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for AA, warranting further investigation.", "body": "1. IntroductionAortic aneurysm (AA) is a potentially life-threatening condition with severe consequences and extensive health risks.[1] Studies indicate that even in cases where the aneurysm has not ruptured, mortality rates remain significantly high.[2,3] In cases of rupture, the mortality rate can escalate to over 90%, making it a significant threat in the field of cardiovascular diseases.[4,5] Faced with this serious health challenge, we cannot ignore its underlying pathological mechanisms. Instead, it is essential to investigate its causes and potential contributing factors thoroughly. This study aims to explore the complex relationship between aortic aneurysms and the role of mitochondria, assessing how it significantly affects the functionality of aortic wall cells and overall vascular health, with the goal of identifying efficient preventive and treatment approaches.In recent years, the relationship between mitochondria and AA has drawn increasing attention.[6] As the powerhouse of the cell, mitochondria provide adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through oxidative phosphorylation, supporting normal physiological functions. In the pathological process of AA, mitochondrial dysfunction is considered 1 of the key factors affecting the structural stability of the aortic wall.[7] When mitochondrial function is impaired, aortic smooth muscle cells fail to receive adequate energy support, leading to decreased cellular function and survival rates.[8] This, in turn, weakens the aortic wall, making it more prone to expansion and rupture, ultimately leading to the formation of an AA. Research has shown that mitochondrial dysfunction is a core mechanism in the development of aneurysms, particularly in vascular smooth muscle cells, where alterations in mitochondrial function profoundly affect the integrity of the aortic wall.[9] Targeting mitochondrial pathways is a possible approach for preventing and treating AA.[10] Dynamin-related protein 1 is a crucial regulatory protein in mitochondrial fission, and studies have found that Dynamin-related protein 1 expression is significantly elevated in aneurysmal tissue from AA patients, suggesting its role in driving mitochondrial fission and the progression of AA.[11] By inhibiting Dynamin-related protein 1 or other proteins involved in mitochondrial fission, the balance of mitochondrial dynamics can be regulated, protecting cellular function and delaying or preventing the onset and progression of AA. Furthermore, the mitochondrial quality control mechanism is central to maintaining mitochondrial health and functional stability.[12] The mitochondrial quality control mechanism ensures the dynamic balance of mitochondria within cells by processes such as mitophagy, fusion, and fission to remove damaged mitochondria. In AA patients, studies have indicated that mitophagy may be impaired, resulting in the accumulation of damaged mitochondria that are not effectively cleared. This imbalance exacerbates the decline in mitochondrial function. The increase in mitochondrial fission and the decrease in fusion lead to the accumulation of damage, increased cell apoptosis, and accelerated pathological progression of AA.[13] In summary, the crucial involvement of mitochondria in the development and advancement of AA indicates that managing mitochondrial function, especially the equilibrium between fission and fusion, presents novel strategies and potential targets for preventing and treating AA.Mendelian randomization (MR), a technique used in epidemiology, utilizes genetic variants as instrumental variables (IVs) to evaluate the cause-and-effect relationships between risk factors and outcomes.[14] MR, a technique used in epidemiology, utilizes genetic variants as IVs to assess the cause-and-effect relationships between risk factors and outcomes. This approach is compelling in its capacity to reduce confounding by leveraging the random assortment of alleles at conception, which mimics the conditions of a randomized controlled trial. Unlike traditional observational studies, which are often susceptible to residual confounding and reverse causation, MR minimizes these biases and enhances the reliability of causal inferences. Furthermore, the use of large-scale genome-wide association study datasets strengthens statistical power and allows for robust assessments of causal relationships across diverse biological pathways.[15] Therefore, this study aims to employ MR to explore the possible cause-and-effect link between mitochondrial factors and AA, while also exploring the underlying biological mechanisms. This could provide valuable insights for the medical field and contribute to advancements in this area of research.2. Materials and methods2.1. Study designThis MR analysis relies on 3 core assumptions, as shown in Figure 1. First, the genetic instruments must have a strong association with the relevant exposure. Second, these genetic variants should not be related to any confounders. Third, the connection between the genetic instruments and the outcome must only arise through their effect on the exposure.[16]Figure 1.Study design.2.2. Data sourceSingle nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) linked to mitochondrial function were sourced from the IEU Open genome-wide association study (GWAS) project, a platform providing publicly available summary statistics for 66 mitochondrial-related proteins. These data were collected from a cohort of 3301 healthy blood donors of European ancestry enrolled in the INTERVAL study (Table S1, Supplemental Digital Content, http://links.lww.com/MD/O460). In compliance with national research ethics guidelines, all participants gave informed consent and provided comprehensive demographic information. To reduce potential biases arising from sample overlap, we used genetic association data related to aortic aneurysm from the FinnGen Biobank, which is publicly accessible at https://r11.finngen.fi/. This dataset includes 8923 cases of European ancestry and 420,324 controls. To assess the credibility of candidate mitochondrial proteins, we conducted replication and meta-analysis using data from the GWAS Catalog (GCST90044010), including 456,348 Europeans, of whom 258 were AA patients, and 456,090 were controls.[17]2.3. Instrumental variables selectionThe instrumental variables (IVs) were selected using a significance threshold of P < 5 × 10−6, with a clumping distance of 10,000 kb and an r2 threshold of <.001 to minimize linkage disequilibrium. To evaluate the strength of the selected IVs, the F-statistic was calculated using the formula F-statistics (F = beta2/se2). This statistic measures how much variance in the exposure is accounted for by the selected IVs.[18] Generally, an F-statistic value below 10 suggests a weak instrument.[19] In this analysis, all SNPs had F-statistics >10, indicating that the IVs were strongly associated with the exposure (Table S2, Supplemental Digital Content, http://links.lww.com/MD/O460).2.4. MR analysisWe examined the relationship between mitochondrial-related exposures and AA using 3 different MR methods: MR-Egger, inverse-variance weighting (IVW), and the weighted median approach. Among these, IVW is the most commonly used method in MR studies due to its ability to efficiently calculate a weighted average of effect estimates from each IV, assuming all IVs are valid.[20] Estimates with lower standard errors contribute more to the final result, improving precision and reliability.[21] Thus, IVW was reported as the primary analytical outcome. Additional methods were employed to ensure the robustness of our findings. MR-Egger regression is particularly advantageous for detecting and adjusting for horizontal pleiotropy, even when some IVs are invalid, under the InSIDE assumption.[22] The weighted mode approach estimates causal effects by focusing on the most frequently weighted values, reducing the influence of outliers and enhancing result stability.[23] Sensitivity analyses, including MR-Egger intercept and MR-PRESSO tests, were conducted to assess horizontal pleiotropy, with a P-value under .05 indicating its presence.[24] Cochran Q-test was applied to test for heterogeneity, where a P-value below .05 implied significant heterogeneity.[25] To further validate the robustness of our results, leave-one-out analysis was performed, confirming that excluding any individual SNP did not substantially alter the overall findings.Additionally, reverse causality between mitochondrial proteins and AA was examined by treating AA as the exposure and mitochondrial proteins as the outcome. SNPs strongly associated with AA (P < 5 × 10−6) were selected as IVs. This study followed the STROBE-R guidelines to ensure proper reporting, and dual-sample MR analyses were conducted using the “TwoSampleMR” package in R version 4.3.1.[26]2.5. Gene expression data analysis and gene set enrichment analysisThe GSE57691 microarray dataset was obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/), utilizing the GPL10558 Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 platform. This dataset includes 10 control samples and 49 aortic tissue samples from AA patients. Differential gene expression analysis was performed using the limma package in R.[27,28] The expression levels of specific genes were visualized using boxplots to highlight their differential expression patterns. gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was conducted with the clusterProfiler package and the c2.cp.kegg.symbols.gmt gene set collection. The results were saved for further analysis.[29,30]2.6. Cell culture and processingHuman aortic VSMCs (vascular smooth muscle cells), obtained from Guangzhou Gene Biotechnology Co., Ltd., were maintained in Dulbecco Modified Eagle Medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Afterward, the cells were transferred to a serum-free medium for further culture. Platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB)-induced collagen deposition and disruption of extracellular matrix (ECM) homeostasis have been linked to increased arterial wall stiffness, potentially promoting the progression of aortic aneurysms.[31–33] In this study, we treated HASMCs with PDGF-BB to create an in vitro model of aortic aneurysms. Specifically, the cells were exposed to 20 ng/mL PDGF-BB (Sigma-Aldrich) for 12 hours.2.7. Real-time quantitative PCRThe RNA from cells was extracted using Trizol (Beyotime, China) and reverse transcribed into cDNA through a synthesis kit containing specific primers and SYBR green reaction mix (Beyotime, China). Real-time qPCR was performed, followed by the calculation of relative gene expression levels using the 2–ΔΔCT approach. The primer sequences: ISCU forward: 5′-GTCTGGATGTGCTGGCTGAA-3′, reverse: 5′-TGCACTTCACGGGCTATCAA-3′; MRPL14 forward: 5′-GCGCTTGGCTGGATCTATCT-3′, reverse: 5′-GCCAGTAGTATCTGGTCGCC-3′; MSRA forward: 5′-TCCTCCTCCACAGCCTCTTT-3′, reverse: 5′-CGGATGTCGGTAGTGATGGG-3′.2.8. Western blotProteins were extracted from cells using a protein extraction kit containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Qichun, China, YWB0501). Protein concentration was measured using the BCA protein assay kit (Beyotime, P0010). The proteins were denatured at 100 °C for 10 minutes, separated using a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, and transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). The membranes were then blocked at room temperature for 10 minutes with a blocking solution (Qichun, China, YWB0501). The membranes were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies. After washing the membranes 3 times, for 5 minutes each, they were probed with secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1 hour. The membranes were washed again 3 times, for 5 minutes each. Enhanced chemiluminescence (Qichun, China, PYT002-200) was used to detect the signal. Finally, signals were recorded using an imaging system. All primary antibodies were obtained from Proteintech (Wuhan, China): ISCU (Cat No. 14812-1-AP), MRPL14 (Cat No. 15040-1-AP), and MSRA (Cat No. 14547-1-AP).2.9. Statistical analysisStatistical analyses were conducted using SPSS version 18.0. Data are presented as means ± SD or means ± SEM. A 1-tailed Student t test was used to compare differences between 2 groups, each with 3 replicates. A P value of <.05 was considered statistically significant. Experimental data were derived from 3 independent replicates for each group unless otherwise noted. Statistical significance is indicated as follows: *P < .05, **P < .01, ***P < .001, ****P < .0001, and ns (not significant).3. Result3.1. The causal effect between mitochondrial-associated proteins and AATo explore the causal effect between mitochondrial-associated proteins and AA, we employed 3 MR analysis methods – MR-Egger, IVW, and weighted median – with IVW serving as the primary approach (Fig. 2). The IVW results demonstrated that several mitochondrial-related proteins are genetically linked to AA, including ISCU (iron–sulfur cluster assembly enzyme; OR = 1.162, 95% CI = 1.054 to 1.280, P = .002), MRPL14 (39S ribosomal protein L14; OR = 0.896, 95% CI = 0.806 to 0.995, P = .041), and MSRA (Mitochondrial peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase; OR = 0.910, 95% CI = 0.829 to 0.998, P = .045; Fig. 3). These findings imply that these protein variations may affect the risk or progression of aortic aneurysm. Scatter plots from the discovery analysis are shown in Figure 4A to C.Figure 2.The causal relationship between mitochondrial proteins and aortic aneurysm of the discovery analysis.Figure 3.Forest map of the causal relationship between mitochondrial proteins and aortic aneurysm of the discovery analysis.Figure 4.Scatter plots and Leave-one-out analysis of the main results of the discovery analysis.

(E) Leave-one-out analysis of 9S ribosomal protein L14, mitochondrial. (F) Leave-one-out analysis of mitochondrial peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase. ISCU = iron–sulfur cluster assembly enzyme.We also performed Cochran Q test, which indicated no significant heterogeneity among the mitochondrial-related protein variables. Further validation through MR-PRESSO detected no outliers in the data. The MR-Egger intercept test revealed no evidence of pleiotropy, as the intercept results were not statistically significant, suggesting that horizontal pleiotropy does not bias our results. While MR-Egger is a widely used method for detecting horizontal pleiotropy, it has theoretical limitations, particularly its reduced statistical power when the number of IVs is small. However, given that our results across multiple sensitivity analyses are consistent and robust, it is unlikely that undetected pleiotropy has materially influenced our findings. Therefore, these sensitivity checks strongly support the robustness and reliability of the identified causal link between mitochondrial-related proteins and AA (Table S3, Supplemental Digital Content, http://links.lww.com/MD/O460). The leave-one-out analysis indicated that no single SNP had a significant impact on the overall causal estimate (Fig. 4D–F).3.2. Reverse causal effect between mitochondrial-associated proteins and AAA reverse MR analysis was performed on the 3 mitochondrial-related proteins that were previously found to be causally linked to aortic aneurysm in the forward MR analysis to assess whether a reverse causal relationship exists. The results indicated that there was no reverse causal association between these proteins and AA. Sensitivity analysis further confirmed this, as Cochran Q test, MR-Egger intercept test, and MR-PRESSO global test all revealed no significant heterogeneity or horizontal pleiotropy (Table S4, Supplemental Digital Content, http://links.lww.com/MD/O460).3.3. Replication and meta-analysis of dataAs expected, similar trends for certain mitochondrial proteins were observed in the replication GWAS dataset (Table S5, Supplemental Digital Content, http://links.lww.com/MD/O460). Meta-analysis of the discovery and replication datasets further demonstrated that ISCU was associated with an increased risk of AA (OR = 1.146, 95% CI = 1.055 to 1.244, P < .05), MRPL14 was associated with a reduced risk of AA (OR = 0.877, 95% CI = 0.800 to 0.962, P < .05), and MSRA was associated with a reduced risk of AA (OR = 0.916, 95% CI = 0.840 to 0.999, P < .05). These results further enhance the robustness of our findings (Fig. 5).Figure 5.Meta-analysis of suggestively significant associations between mitochondrial proteins and aortic aneurysm (A) Iron–sulfur cluster assembly enzyme ISCU, mitochondrial; (B) 39S ribosomal protein L14, mitochondrial; (C) mitochondrial peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase. ISCU = iron–sulfur cluster assembly enzyme.3.4. Expression profiles of ISCU, MRPL14, and MSRA in AA tissues and gene set enrichment analysisWe further validated the expression levels of ISCU, MRPL14, and MSRA using the GEO dataset GSE57691. The results showed that ISCU expression was significantly upregulated in AA tissue samples, whereas MRPL14 and MSRA were relatively downregulated (Fig. 6A). Additionally, we performed GSEA by dividing the samples into high-expression and low-expression groups based on the expression levels of ISCU, MRPL14, and MSRA, respectively, to analyze the pathways potentially influenced by these genes (Fig. 7). ISCU was enriched in Gene Ontology (GO) terms related to bacterial response, protein localization, wound healing, and cell junctions, while Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis showed enrichment in adipocytokine signaling, complement and coagulation cascades, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, primary immunodeficiency, ribosome, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling. MRPL14 was associated with protein localization, wound healing, bacterial response, and cell junctions in GO analysis, and enriched in complement and coagulation cascades, MAPK signaling, primary immunodeficiency, ribosome, Toll-like receptor signaling, and VEGF signaling in KEGG analysis. MSRA was linked to B cell proliferation, protein localization, wound healing, bacterial response, and cell junctions in GO analysis, while KEGG analysis showed enrichment in complement and coagulation cascades, MAPK signaling, primary immunodeficiency, ribosome, Toll-like receptor signaling, and VEGF signaling.Figure 6.Validation of ISCU, MRPL14, and MSRA Expression in Aortic Aneurysm: Transcriptomic and Experimental Evidence: (A) Differential expression analysis of ISCU, MRPL14, and MSRA in aortic aneurysm tissues using the GEO dataset (GSE57691); (B) qPCR validation of ISCU, MRPL14, and MSRA expression levels in PDGF-BB-induced human aortic smooth muscle cells.

In vitro validation of mitochondrial protein and gene expression in PDGF-BB-induced aortic smooth muscle cellsTo validate the expression levels of the 3 mitochondrial-related proteins and their corresponding mRNA levels in vitro, we employed a PDGF-BB-induced aortic smooth muscle cell model. qPCR analysis revealed significant changes in the mRNA expression of the 3 mitochondrial-related proteins, with ISCU being upregulated and MRPL14 and MSRA downregulated in PDGF-BB-induced aortic smooth muscle cells (Fig. 6B). Consistently, Western blot results corroborated these findings at the protein level, showing elevated ISCU protein levels and reduced MRPL14 and MSRA protein levels in the same model (Fig. 6C–D). These findings are consistent with our previous observations.4. DiscussionUsing a 2-sample MR approach, we analyzed data from the IEU OpenGWAS database, which included 66 mitochondrial function-related exposures, as well as aortic aneurysm data from 2 independent datasets. Through IVW as the primary MR method, complemented by sensitivity analyses, replication, and meta-analysis, we identified ISCU, MRPL14, and MSRA as mitochondrial proteins associated with AA. Specifically, ISCU was linked to an increased risk of AA, while MRPL14 and MSRA were associated with a reduced risk. These findings align with recent studies emphasizing mitochondrial dysfunction as a key factor in vascular pathologies, yet our study is the first to establish a causal relationship using MR analysis.[34] Furthermore, these associations were validated using gene expression data from the GEO database, along with functional validation in TGF-β1-induced aortic smooth muscle cells, reinforcing the involvement of mitochondrial proteins in aneurysm-related cellular dysfunction.The investigation of mitochondrial proteins in relation to AA holds substantial clinical significance. This study reveals significant alterations in the expression of 3 key mitochondrial proteins in AA patients, suggesting that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a crucial role in aneurysm pathogenesis. Mitochondrial impairment has been increasingly recognized as a central contributor to vascular remodeling and arterial wall instability.[35] However, previous studies have primarily focused on mitochondrial DNA mutations and respiratory chain defects rather than specific mitochondrial proteins involved in AA.[6,36] Our findings highlight ISCU, MRPL14, and MSRA as potential contributors to these processes, bridging a critical gap between mitochondrial dysfunction and AA development.Mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to AA through mechanisms such as oxidative stress, apoptosis, extracellular matrix remodeling, and vascular inflammation. ISCU plays a central role in iron–sulfur cluster assembly, which is essential for mitochondrial respiration, DNA repair, and redox homeostasis. Aberrant regulation of ISCU has been implicated in mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to excessive reactive oxygen species production and oxidative stress.[37] In our study, ISCU was significantly upregulated in AA tissues and TGF-β1-treated vascular smooth muscle cells, suggesting that dysregulated ISC assembly may contribute to aneurysm formation. Mechanistically, increased ISCU expression may lead to mitochondrial iron overload, causing oxidative stress via the Fenton reaction, which generates highly reactive hydroxyl radicals.[38] This process has been linked to lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, and mitochondrial DNA damage, all of which are known contributors to vascular remodeling and ECM degradation in AA. Additionally, excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) can activate Nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells and MAPK signaling pathways, leading to increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, further exacerbating vascular inflammation and aortic wall weakening.[39]MRPL14 is a mitochondrial ribosomal protein required for mitochondrial translation and oxidative phosphorylation. Its downregulation has been associated with reduced mitochondrial biogenesis, impaired ATP production, and increased susceptibility to apoptosis.[40] In our study, MRPL14 expression was significantly reduced in AA tissues, which may contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction and vascular degeneration. Loss of MRPL14 could lead to impaired mitochondrial electron transport chain function, resulting in increased ROS production and mitochondrial depolarization, both of which have been shown to promote vascular smooth muscle cell apoptosis and ECM degradation.[41] Additionally, defective mitochondrial translation may impair the synthesis of respiratory chain components, reducing ATP availability and triggering AMPK activation, a known modulator of VSMC contractility and survival.[42] These processes collectively contribute to aortic wall weakening and aneurysm formation.MSRA is an enzyme responsible for repairing oxidized methionine residues in proteins, thereby protecting cells from oxidative stress. Reduced MSRA expression has been linked to increased oxidative damage and impaired cellular homeostasis.[43] Our study found that MSRA expression was significantly lower in AA tissues, which may indicate a reduced capacity for oxidative stress repair. MSRA deficiency may exacerbate ROS-induced protein oxidation, leading to structural instability of key mitochondrial and ECM proteins.[44] Furthermore, oxidized proteins can activate autophagic and apoptotic pathways, leading to increased smooth muscle cell death and progressive ECM remodeling, both of which are hallmarks of aneurysm pathology.[45] This suggests that MSRA downregulation may contribute to AA progression by impairing the mitochondrial stress response and increasing oxidative damage to the vascular wall.Mitochondrial dysfunction has been increasingly linked to vascular diseases, yet its role as a potential therapeutic target in AA remains largely unexplored. This study emphasizes the importance of ISCU, MRPL14, and MSRA in mitochondrial homeostasis and their possible contributions to aneurysm formation. Notably, our findings suggest that targeting mitochondrial oxidative stress pathways could be a viable strategy for AA intervention. While existing AA treatments primarily focus on surgical repair and blood pressure control, emerging evidence supports the potential of mitochondrial-targeted therapies, such as antioxidants and mitochondrial biogenesis enhancers, in vascular diseases.[46] However, whether modulating ISCU, MRPL14, or MSRA expression could mitigate aneurysm progression requires further investigation.Despite the strengths of this study, several limitations should be acknowledged. First, the dataset primarily consists of individuals of European ancestry, limiting the generalizability of our findings across diverse populations. Genetic variation and environmental influences may lead to population-specific differences in AA susceptibility and mitochondrial function.[47] Future studies should include multi-ethnic cohorts to enhance external validity. Additionally, the dataset lacks critical demographic details such as age and sex, which may influence mitochondrial protein expression and AA risk. Moreover, our study establishes a causal relationship between mitochondrial proteins and AA but does not fully elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. Although GSEA identified key pathways involving inflammation, immune regulation, and oxidative stress, further experimental validation is required to confirm their direct roles in AA pathogenesis. Future research should incorporate high-resolution techniques such as single-cell RNA sequencing or proteomics to provide cell-type-specific insights into mitochondrial dysfunction in AA. Lastly, a multivariable MR analysis was not performed, mainly due to sample size limitations.[48] Expanding datasets and improving statistical power will be essential for a more comprehensive analysis of mitochondrial proteins in AA.5. ConclusionThis study provides novel insights into the mitochondrial mechanisms underlying AA pathogenesis, identifying ISCU, MRPL14, and MSRA as key contributors. By integrating MR analysis, gene expression validation, and functional enrichment analysis, our findings offer a comprehensive perspective on mitochondrial dysfunction in AA. The identification of these mitochondrial proteins as potential therapeutic targets underscores the need for further research into mitochondrial-directed interventions for AA prevention and treatment.Author contributionsConceptualization: Li Li, Mukamengjiang Juaiti.Data curation: Adilai Abodulikemu, Li Li, Mukamengjiang Juaiti.Formal analysis: Adilai Abodulikemu, Li Li, Mukamengjiang Juaiti.Funding acquisition: Mukamengjiang Juaiti.Investigation: Mukamengjiang Juaiti.Methodology: Adilai Abodulikemu, Li Li, Mukamengjiang Juaiti.Project administration: Mukamengjiang Juaiti.Resources: Adilai Abodulikemu, Li Li, Mukamengjiang Juaiti.Software: Adilai Abodulikemu, Li Li.Supervision: Adilai Abodulikemu, Li Li.Validation: Adilai Abodulikemu.Visualization: Adilai Abodulikemu.Writing – review & editing: Adilai Abodulikemu, Mukamengjiang Juaiti.Writing – original draft: Mukamengjiang Juaiti.Supplementary Material"}

Studies involving adult CVD patients with anxiety or depressive symptoms who underwent ICBT interventions were included. Statistical analyses used random-effects models, with subgroup analyses performed to assess the impact of intervention format, module number, and program duration. Sensitivity and publication bias assessments ensured the robustness of the findings.ResultsEight RCTs with 1177 participants were included. ICBT significantly reduced depressive symptoms (SMD = -0.32, 95% CI [-0.56, -0.08], p < 0.015) and anxiety symptoms (SMD = -0.37, 95% CI [-0.68, -0.06], p < 0.001). Subgroup analysis indicated that self-guided ICBT was more effective than therapist-guided ICBT. Programs with fewer than eight modules were more effective for anxiety, while those with eight or more modules were more effective for depression. Shorter programs (< 9 weeks) were better for anxiety, whereas longer programs (≥ 9 weeks) were more effective for depression.ConclusionsICBT is an effective intervention for managing anxiety and depression in CVD patients. Tailoring ICBT interventions based on symptom type, module number, and program duration can optimize outcomes. Future research should explore personalized, long-term strategies to enhance effectiveness and safety.", "body": "1IntroductionCardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases (CVDs), encompassing ischemic heart disease, hypertension, heart failure, and stroke, represent one of the most pressing global health challenges of the 21st century (1, 2). These diseases not only constitute the leading cause of mortality worldwide, with approximately 17.5 million deaths annually (31% of total global deaths), but also impose an overwhelming burden on healthcare systems and society at large (3). Current projections indicate that CVD-related deaths will increase by 37% to reach 23.4 million by 2030 (4).Within this disease spectrum, cerebrovascular disease, particularly stroke, presents a significant health burden. Stroke accounts for 10% of global deaths, with more than half of survivors requiring assistance with daily activities (5). Hypertension plays a crucial role in CVD progression by altering vascular structure and function (6).Mental health complications, particularly depression and anxiety, frequently co-occur with CVDs and create a devastating cycle: psychological distress exacerbates cardiovascular symptoms, while deteriorating physical health further impacts mental well-being, significantly compromising patient outcomes. Depression is associated with a two-fold increase in mortality risk among CVD patients (7), while anxiety disorders double the risk of cardiac death compared to the general population (8). In patients with cerebrovascular disease, these psychological symptoms correlate with executive dysfunction and increased risk of subsequent strokes (9).Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has emerged as a gold-standard, evidence-based intervention for managing these psychological symptoms, demonstrating superior efficacy in reducing depression and anxiety symptoms compared to other psychological interventions. CBT’s structured approach specifically addresses the unique psychological challenges faced by CVD patients through systematic cognitive restructuring and behavioral activation. CBT helps patients identify and modify negative thought patterns through structured, time-limited psychotherapy sessions (10, 11). While traditional face-to-face CBT shows efficacy, its implementation faces numerous barriers, including limited accessibility, high costs, and therapist shortages (12).Internet-based CBT (ICBT) represents a revolutionary advancement in psychological intervention delivery, gaining unprecedented prominence during the COVID-19 pandemic (13). This innovative approach combines the proven effectiveness of traditional CBT with the accessibility and scalability of digital health technologies, offering a potentially transformative solution for addressing the mental health needs of CVD patients. ICBT offers advantages over traditional CBT, including enhanced accessibility, privacy, and flexibility (14). Studies indicate that ICBT can match the effectiveness of traditional CBT while addressing many of its practical limitations (15).While substantial evidence supports ICBT’s effectiveness in managing depression and anxiety among chronic disease patients (16, 17), there exists a critical knowledge gap regarding its specific application and effectiveness in CVD populations( (18, 19). Current literature shows inconsistent findings, varying methodological quality, and insufficient understanding of the optimal program characteristics for this unique patient group. Furthermore, the relationship between ICBT program characteristics (such as module content and duration) and treatment outcomes requires clarification.This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to address these critical knowledge gaps by comprehensively examining the effectiveness of ICBT in managing anxiety and depression among CVD patients. By synthesizing existing evidence and analyzing program characteristics associated with optimal outcomes, this research will provide essential insights for developing targeted, evidence-based ICBT interventions for CVD patients and inform clinical implementation strategies.2MethodsThe meta-analysis protocol was registered on the International Platform of Registered Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols (INPLASY2023100040) on 10 October 2023.2.1PICOS statementPopulation: Adult patients diagnosed with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs); Intervention: Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT); Comparator: Standard care, waitlist control, or other active treatments.2.2Search strategiesWe searched the following databases from their inception to December 2023 for relevant RCTs, including The Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO, Chinese Biomedical (CBM) database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and WanFang database. These included studies were searched using GoogleScholar. All the searches were performed using the following keywords without language restrictions, including “internet-based intervention”, “cognitive behavioral therapy”, “cardiovascular diseases”, and “cerebrovascular disorders”. Two reviewers screened the searched records by titles and abstracts and then reviewed the full text of eligible RCTs. The reference lists of identified studies were further searched to reduce the missing trials. A third reviewer was invited to help with the decision if the two reviewers had discrepancies in the inclusion of studies.2.3Eligibility criteria2.3.1Studies and participantsOnly RCTs were eligible. Patients with CVDs diagnosed with symptoms of anxiety or depression, and the RCTs reported the effects of the ICBT intervention on anxiety or depression were included, regardless of patients’ gender, age, ethnicity, types of cardiovascular disease, stage of cardiovascular disease, and current treatment.2.3.2Interventions and controlsInterventions and controls: The included RCTs evaluated ICBT delivered in the following formats: Individual therapy, Group therapy, Self-guided programs, Therapist-guided programs, Combined formats (individual + group), ICBT programs of any frequency or duration were included, with treatment delivery via web platforms, mobile applications, or other internet-based channels. We defined ICBT as structured cognitive behavioral therapy delivered via internet-based platforms, which may include Synchronous (real-time) sessions, Asynchronous modules, Interactive exercises, Homework assignments, Progress monitoring, Automated feedback systems, Optional therapist guidance (email, chat, or video consultation).2.3.3OutcomesAnxiety and depression symptoms were assessed using validated measurement tools, including but not limited to: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Hamilton Rating Scales. Only studies using validated instruments with reported psychometric properties were included.2.4Exclusion criteriaStudies were excluded if they: Combined ICBT with face-to-face therapy, used non-internet-based delivery methods, included patients with severe psychiatric comorbidities, lacked clear ICBT protocol description, had insufficient outcome data, used non-validated measurement tools.2.5Screening and data extractionTwo trained reviewers administered a data collection form and subsequently extracted outcome data independently. The extracted data were then cross-referenced by these two reviewers and any inconsistencies were addressed through thoughtful discussion. In cases where data was not readily available, we made efforts to reach out to the authors of the study.2.6Risk of bias assessmentOur team of experts thoroughly analyzed the included studies, utilizing the esteemed Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews to ensure the validity of the findings (20). When there were conflicting results between reviewers, our reviewers engaged in an in-depth discussion to make the decision. If a consensus cannot be reached, a third reviewer is involved to determine the results.2.7Data analysisStatistical analyses were performed using STATA version 18.0. Effect sizes were calculated using random-effects models unless heterogeneity was low (I² < 50%, p > 0.1). Continuous variables were analyzed using standardized mean difference (SMD). 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for each effect size. The I² test was used to verify the heterogeneity between studies, and sensitivity analysis was performed according to the single study deletion method to test the stability of the results. If the heterogeneity between studies was small (p > 0.1, I² < 50%), the high homogeneity of the research results can be considered, and the fixed effect model was used for analysis. When substantial heterogeneity (p ≤ 0.1, I² ≥ 50%) was observed, there may be heterogeneity between the results, and a random-effects model was used for our analysis (20).Subgroup analysis was conducted to examine the outcome measures in this study. We utilized sensitivity analysis to eliminate studies that deviated substantially from the rest in terms of their approach or conclusions. By systematically removing each study and comparing the revised findings to the initial ones, we were able to reevaluate the data using a meta-analysis approach.2.8Reporting bias assessmentThe reporting and publication biases of included studies were evaluated by visual inspection of the asymmetry of the funnel plot. Begg’s and Egger’s tests were used to test the publication bias when the number of the included studies was > 5 for a given outcome.3Results3.1Search resultsAs shown in \nFigure 1\n, Database searches yielded 766 records: Cochrane Library (n=259), PubMed (n=95), Embase (n=180), Web of Science (n=95), PsycINFO (n=16), CBM (n=15), CNKI (n=62), and Wanfang (n=44). After removing 216 duplicates, 550 records remained for screening. Subsequently, upon an initial examination of the titles and abstracts, it was determined that 513 records did not fulfill the specified inclusion criteria and were excluded. When reading the full text, 24 records were deleted (14 non-RCTs, 3 duplicate populations, and 7 unable to access). In addition, 5 cases were excluded because useful data could not be obtained for further analysis. Finally, 8 studies were included in the meta-analysis.Figure 1Flowchart of this study.3.2Study characteristicsEight articles were incorporated into this meta-analysis. \nTable 1\n provides an overview of the included studies, including various factors: subject demographics (location, sample size, age, gender, and type of CVDs), characteristics of the ICBT (form, number, and content of modules, duration, frequency, and program length), the control group, outcome measures, time points of data collection, and any reported adverse events.Table 1Studies included in the meta-analysis.Author, yearCountrySampleAge(mean± SD)Gender(female/male)CVDs typeIntervention group: form, number of modules, duration, frequency, program lengthControl groupOutcome indicatorTime pointsAdverseeventsGlozier, 2013 (21)AustraliaIG: 280CG: 282IG:57.5± 6.6CG:58.4± 6.6IG: 173/107CG: 172/110Not reportedICBT (self-guided), 12 modules; 30-60 min/time, once a week, 12 weeksHealth WatchPHQ-9; GAD-7baseline; 12 weeksNoneLundgren, 2016 (18)SwedenIG:25CG:25IG:63.6± 13.9CG:62.3± 11.7IG: 10/15CG: 11/14HFICBT (self-guided), 7 modules; unclear duration, once a week, 9 weeksDiscussion forumPHQ-9; CAQ (total); CAQ (fear); CAQ (avoidance); CAQ (attention)baseline; 9 weeksNot reportedSimblett, 2017 (23)EnglandIG:19CG:9IG:62.1± 11.4CG:64.6± 8.1IG:9/10CG:1/8StrokeICBT (self-guided), 8 modules; about 60 min/time, once a week, 8 weekscCRTBDI-II;BAIbaseline; 12 weeksNot reportedNorlund, 2018 (25)SwedenIG: 117CG: 122IG:58.4± 9.0CG:60.8± 7.8IG:44/73CG:36/86MIICBT (therapist-guided), 10 modules; duration ranged between 5 and 30 min, once a week, 14 weeksTAUHADS-T; HADS-A; HADS-D; MADRS-S; BADS-SF; CAQbaseline; 14 weeksTwo patients in the iCBT group and 3 patients in the control or suicidal ideation at follow-upLiang, 2018 (35)ChinaIG:34CG:33IG:51.55± 6.10CG:51.48 ± 12.89IG:8/26CG:14/19StrokeICBT (therapist-guided), 6 modules; about 60 min/time, once a week, 8 weeksPhonefollow-upPHQ-9; GAD-7baseline; 4 weeks; 8 weeksNot reportedJohansson, 2019 (26)SwedenIG:72CG:72IG: 61± 13CG:64± 12IG:25/47CG:30/42MixedICBT (self-guided), 7 modules; unclear duration, once a week, 9 weeksonline discussion forumPHQ-9; MADRS-S;GAD-7;CAQ (total); CAQ (attention); CAQ (avoidance); CAQ (fear)baseline; 9 weeksNoneSchneider, 2020 (20)CanadaIG:25CG:28IG:56.72± 11.90CG:59.29± 6.93IG:12/13CG:19/9Acute coronary eventICBT (self-guided), 5 modules; unclear duration, 5 modules delivered online over 8 weeks, 8 weeksWaiting-list ControlPHQ-9; GAD-7; CAQ (total); CAQ (attention); CAQ (avoidance); CAQ (fear); DASS-21(total); DASS-21(depression); DASS-21(anxiety); DASS-21(stress)baseline; 8 weekstemporary increase in symptoms (n = 2) and discomfort in addressing symptoms (n = 1)Bendig, 2021 (15)GermanyIG18CG:16Total: 56.4 ± 10.2Total:12/22Not reportedICBT (therapist-guided), 8 modules; 45-60 minutes, once a week, 8 weeksWaiting-list ControlPHQ-9; GAD-7baseline; 8 weeksNoneIG, internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy group; CG, Control Group; CVDs, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease; HF, heart failure; MI, myocardial infarction; cCRT, computerized cognitive remediation therapy; TAU, Treatment as usual; PHQ-9, Patient Health Questionnaire-9; GAD-7, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7; CAQ, Cardiac Anxiety Questionnaire; BDI-II, Beck Depression Inventory-II; BAI, Beck Anxiety Inventory; HADS-T, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale total score; HADS-A, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale anxiety subscale; HADS-D, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale depression subscale; MADRS-S, The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale-Self Rated; DASS-21, depression anxiety stress scale.3.3ParticipantsThe mean age of participants in all trials was 60.98 years (range = 50 - 70). Participants were predominantly male and only one trial (21) had > 50% women in both the intervention and control groups, and another trial (22) had > 50% women in the control group.Regarding the type of CVDs, two trials (23, 24) involved patients with stroke, one (25)with myocardial infarction, one (22) with acute coronary event, and one (18) with heart failure. In addition, three trials did not identify the type of CVDs at the time of recruitment, and one (26) of these trials reported all types of CVDs in enrolled participants (atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter; coronary heart disease; heart failure), while the other two (15, 21) were not explicitly reported.3.4InterventionThe included trials were centered around the framework and material of the ICBT training program, adhering to the principles of CBT. Participants were able to conveniently complete all assessment measures online and send them in through a secure electronic platform. The interventions were facilitated either by experienced psychologists or through self-guided methods. The ICBT interventions were categorized into therapist-guided [n=3 (15, 24, 25)] and self-guided programs [n=5 (18, 21–23, 26)]. ICBT intervention modules of two trials (21, 25) were ≥ 10, and the remaining trials were < 10 but ≥ 5 modules. Most interventions ranged in duration from 30 to 60 minutes and were given once a week. The program length of the ICBT intervention ranged from 8 to 14 weeks.3.5ControlsThe control group was a waiting group in one trial (22).Two trials used usual care as a control measure (24, 25). The other 5 trials used “active” control groups (15, 18, 21, 23, 26), meaning control measures with less feedback or less extension than the intervention group.3.6Risk of biasThe risk of bias assessment by domain is shown in \nFigure 2\n. All studies had a low risk of random sequence generation, allocation concealment, and selective reporting. Details about participants and personnel blinding were provided in two studies (21, 24), while three trials (21, 24, 26) reported blinding of outcome assessment, so they were regarded low risk. In addition, three trials had an unclear risk of other bias (18, 23, 26), and one trial had a high risk of other bias (15) (\nFigure 2\n).Figure 2Risk of bias assessment using the Cochrane tool.3.7Analysis of overall effectsAll 8 studies (1177 patients) reported the effects of ICBT on the depressive and anxiety symptoms of CVD patients. The meta-analysis revealed a significant effect of ICBT in reducing depressive symptoms for patients with CVDs (SMD = -0.32, 95% CI [− 0.56, − 0.08], p < 0.015, I2 = 59.6%). Similarly, the ICBT was effective in reducing anxiety symptoms (SMD = -0.37, 95% CI [− 0.68, − 0.06], P < 0.001, I2 = 75.3%) (\nFigure 3\n).Figure 3Overall effect of ICBT on depression (A) and anxiety (B). 95%CI: 95% confidence interval.Assessment of publication bias using Begg’s test (p=0.711) and Egger’s test (p=0.346) showed no significant publication bias for depression outcomes. Similar results were found for anxiety outcomes (Begg’s p=0.621; Egger’s p=0.405). Therefore, no significant publication bias was found. The two funnel plots did not reveal any significant asymmetry, supporting the stability of the results (\nFigure 4\n).Figure 4Funnel plot of comparison: overall effect of ICBT on depression (A) and anxiety (B). SMD, standardized mean difference; SE, standard error.3.8Subgroup and sensitivity analysis3.8.1Form of interventionWe divided the forms of intervention into two groups: self-guided and therapist guided. The self-guided approach had a medium effect on depressive symptoms (SMD = -0.38, 95% CI [− 0.70, − 0.07], p = 0.035) but the effect of ICBT on anxiety (SMD = -0.42, 95% CI [− 0.86, 0.03], p < 0.01) is uncertain. The therapist-guided ICBT may have an effect, but the CI crossing zero renders it uncertain on depression (SMD = -0.18, 95% CI [− 0.76, 0.40], p = 0.031) and anxiety (SMD = -0.30, 95% CI [− 0.90, 0.30], p = 0.029) symptoms (\nTables 2\n, \n3\n).Table 2Subgroup analyses of effects of ICBT on depression score changes in patients with CVDs.Outcome typeKESSample sizeI2\nRandom-effects analysisSMD95%CIPIGCGLUForm of interventionSelf-guided5542141661.2%-0.38-0.70-0.070.035Therapist-guided3316917171.2%-0.18-0.760.400.031Number of modules<84415615876.1%-0.37-0.880.310.006≧84443442929.8%*\n-0.25-0.40-0.110.234Length of program<9 weeks33777783.5%-0.38-1.370.600.002≧9 weeks5551351022.7%*\n-0.28-0.41-0.150.270K, number of studies; ES, number of effect sizes; IG, Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy group; CG, control group; SMD, standardized mean difference effect size; L, lower; U, upper; *:applied fixed effect model.Table 3Subgroup analyses of effects of ICBT on anxiety score changes in patients with CVDs.Outcome typeKESSample sizeI2\nRandom-effects analysisSMD95%CIPIGCGLUForm of interventionSelf-guided5542141680.8%-0.42-0.860.03<0.001Therapist-guided3316917171.9%-0.30-0.900.300.029Number of modules<84415615879.5%-0.71-1.27-0.150.002≧8444344290.0%*\n-0.11-0.260.030.599Length of program<9 weeks33777771.3%-0.93-1.71-0.150.031≧9 weeks555135100.0%*\n-0.15-0.28-0.020.520K, number of studies; ES, number of effect sizes; IG, Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy group; CG, control group; SMD, standardized mean difference effect size; L, lower; U, upper; *:applied fixed effect model.3.8.2Number of modulesWhen the number of ICBT modules was < 8, the ICBT had insufficient evidence of an effect on depression (SMD =-0.37, 95% CI [− 0.88, 0.13], p = 0.006) symptoms, but a relatively large effect was observed on anxiety (SMD = -0.71, 95% CI [−1.27, -0.15], p = 0.002) in patients with CVDs. When the number of modules was ≥ 8, the ICBT had a small effect on relieving depression (SMD = -0.25, 95% CI [− 0.40, − 0.11], p = 0.234) symptoms, but the current data are insufficient to support the effect of ICBT on anxiety (SMD = -0.11, 95% CI [− 0.26, 0.02], p = 0.599) symptoms (\nTables 2\n, \n3\n).3.8.3Length of programThe ICBT intervention lasting for < 9 weeks had no sufficient evidence of effect on depression (SMD = -0.38, 95% CI [− 1.37, 0.60], p = 0.002) but showed a large effect on anxiety (SMD =-0.93, 95% CI [− 1.71, − 0.15], p = 0.031) symptoms in patients with CVDs. The ICBT intervention lasting for ≥ 9 weeks had a small effect on depression (SMD = -0.28, 95% CI [−0.41, -0.15], p = 0.270) symptoms but lack of statistical evidence for an effect on anxiety (SMD = -0.15, 95% CI [− 0.28, -0.02], p = 0.520) symptoms (\nTables 2\n, \n3\n).3.8.4Sensitivity analysisAfter systematically removing the individual results of each study, the overall estimated effect remained largely unchanged. Therefore, no single study significantly influenced the overall conclusion. Although there were some variations among the studies, the results consistently demonstrated the efficacy of ICBT in alleviating symptoms of anxiety and depression (\nFigure 5\n).Figure 5Sensitivity analysis of ICBT on depression (A) and anxiety (B). CI, confidence interval.3.8.5Adverse eventsA total of five studies (15, 21, 22, 25, 26) reported adverse events associated with ICBT. One study (22) reported a temporary increase in symptoms after treatment in two cases and one reported feeling uncomfortable while dealing with symptoms. In addition, in the follow-up of another study (22), two participants from the ICBT group and three from the control group disclosed having suicidal thoughts. Other studies did not observe any negative occurrences (\nTable 1\n).4DiscussionThis meta-analysis included 8 studies that evaluated how ICBT affected patients with CVDs regarding depressive or anxiety symptoms. According to these results, ICBT had a significant effect in diminishing symptoms of both depression and anxiety. This aligns with findings from two meta-analyses by Pang et al (27).and Bisby et al (28), which independently assessed whether internet-based psychological interventions were effective in reducing depression or anxiety. However, both meta-analyses included many different online psychological interventions. These meta-analyses included various psychological interventions, such as virtual mindfulness therapy and remote acceptance and commitment therapy, without specific focus on a single intervention type. Moreover, the samples were not limited to patients with CVDs. This heterogeneity in intervention types and patient populations limited the generalizability of conclusions. Our study aimed at patients with CVDs and only focused on ICBT. The subgroup analyses explored specific effects of different types and forms of intervention with varying lengths. Our findings supported which components of ICBT were most effective in relieving the symptoms of patients with CVDs.We have classified intervention approaches into two categories: self-guided and therapist guided. We found that self-guided ICBT was more effective in easing symptoms of anxiety and depression among patients with CVDs than therapist-guided ICBT. This result is consistent with the results of previous work (29). This difference may be attributed to several reasons: first, self-guided ICBT enhances patient autonomy and flexibility so that patients can integrate the treatment into their daily routines with greater scheduling flexibility than regular live sessions or follow-up calls. This flexibility not only enhances treatment accessibility but also potentially increases therapeutic efficacy through increased patient autonomy in managing their treatment schedule. Second, self-guided ICBT can protect patient privacy and dignity (7). However, we acknowledge that therapist-guided ICBT may be more suitable for patients who need greater professional support and guidance. Treatment selection should be based on comprehensive evaluation of individual patient preferences, clinical needs, and specific circumstances. Current research on ICBT lacks studies that directly evaluate the relative efficacy of therapist-guided versus self-guided treatments in reducing anxiety and depressive symptoms among patients with CVDs. Future research needs to be conducted with meticulous attention to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of each method of intervention. Furthermore, it would be highly beneficial to devise strategies for effectively integrating patients’ treatment preferences with various forms of intervention to attain optimal treatment results and enhance patients’ overall well-being.The module number of ICBT interventions received particular attention in this meta-analysis, with studies involving between 5 and 12 different CBT modules. The analysis revealed that the efficacy of ICBT is significantly impacted by the number of modules. Specifically, when the number of modules is less than 8, ICBT is significantly effective in alleviating anxiety symptoms in patients with CVDs, possibly because the simplified number of modules facilitates more targeted therapeutic intervention, reduce the cognitive burden of patients, and make the treatment information easier to understand and practice, thereby reducing anxiety symptoms. When the number of modules reached eight or more, the ICBT improved depressive symptoms more significantly, which may reflect the need for more comprehensive intervention in the management of depressive symptoms, covering more psychosocial aspects, and helping patients to build a broader range of life management skills. These findings suggest that the number of modules and the depth of treatment should be adjusted according to the characteristics of symptoms when designing ICBT interventions. Page et al. tested the effects of ICBT with a different number of modules (16), which is inconsistent with the results of this study, suggesting additional research to determine the most effective interventions to address anxiety and depressive symptoms in patients with CVDs. Additionally, it would be beneficial to explore personalized treatment strategies to better meet the individual needs of each patient (30).A significant correlation was identified between the duration of ICBT interventions and their effectiveness in alleviating anxiety and depression symptoms. Notably, the impact of intervention duration differed depending on the specific symptom targeted. Consistent with previous research (31, 32), shorter ICBT programs (less than nine weeks) were more effective in reducing anxiety symptoms in patients with CVDs. This may be due to the nature of anxiety disorders, which can respond rapidly to focused, short-term interventions that promote high levels of engagement (20). In contrast, addressing depressive symptoms often requires longer intervention periods to effectively modify the emotional, cognitive, and behavioral patterns associated with depression. Extended treatment durations allow patients to gain a deeper understanding of depression mechanisms, develop effective coping strategies, receive comprehensive professional skills training, and address underlying psychological issues. Therefore, when designing ICBT treatment plans, the duration should be tailored to the specific symptoms being addressed. It is essential to further investigate how varying treatment durations affect the reduction of anxiety and depression symptoms and to develop optimized treatment protocols for individuals with CVDs.The analysis indicated no significant publication bias among the included studies, thereby enhancing the credibility of our findings. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the influence of each individual study on the overall results. The removal of any single study did not alter the overall effect, suggesting that no single study disproportionately influenced the meta-analysis outcomes. Although some heterogeneity was observed across the study results, additional analyses confirmed that ICBT effectively reduced anxiety and depression symptoms in patients with CVDs.Regarding adverse events, five studies in this study reported adverse events, including temporary exacerbation of symptoms after treatment, discomfort when dealing with symptoms, and a small number of patients reporting suicidal thoughts. These incidents remind us of the need to closely monitor patients when implementing ICBT, and the need to establish appropriate safety monitoring mechanisms and management measures to ensure patient safety. Incorporating all of our evidence, the evidence suggests that ICBT demonstrates significant therapeutic efficacy for addressing symptoms of anxiety and depression among individuals with CVD (33).however, due to the possibility of adverse events, enhanced monitoring protocols should be implemented when implementing ICBT interventions in the future to minimize potential negative effects and improve safety (34).This study has several limitations. First, the quality assessment of the included literature may be subject to individual variability and subjectivity. Additionally, this meta-analysis did not include any ongoing studies, which may affect the comprehensiveness of the findings. The use of various scales to measure outcomes introduced heterogeneity, potentially reducing the accuracy of the results. Second, most included studies featured short trial durations and small sample sizes, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Variations in ICBT types and intervention methods across studies could also influence the outcomes. Although ICBT interventions are generally considered safe, the incomplete reporting of adverse events hampers a thorough evaluation of their safety profile. Future research should undertake comprehensive examinations of different ICBT interventions and their effects on symptoms in patients with CVDs. Conducting long-term follow-up studies would also facilitate the assessment of the sustained efficacy of ICBT. Moreover, establishing a more robust system for documenting and reporting adverse events would enhance our understanding of ICBT applications in this population. Despite these limitations, our findings provide a foundation for future research aimed at improving the effectiveness and safety of ICBT protocols for individuals with CVDs.5ConclusionThis study demonstrated that Internet-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (ICBT) significantly reduces anxiety and depressive symptoms in patients with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Notably, self-guided ICBT was found to be more effective than therapist-guided ICBT in mitigating these symptoms. Additionally, ICBT interventions comprising fewer than eight modules were more effective in alleviating anxiety symptoms, whereas interventions with eight or more modules showed greater efficacy in addressing depressive symptoms. Regarding treatment duration, programs lasting less than nine weeks were more suitable for managing anxiety, while those extending to nine weeks or longer were more effective for depression. These results underscore the necessity of tailoring ICBT interventions to the specific symptoms and individual needs of patients with CVDs. Future research should focus on evaluating long-term and personalized ICBT strategies to further enhance the management of anxiety and depressive symptoms in this population."}

MEDLINE, Scopus and Web of Science were searched using the following keywords: “speckle tracking”, “global strain”, “longitudinal strain”, “circumferential strain”, “radial strain”, “atrial strain”, “right ventricular strain”, or “left ventricular strain” and “systemic sclerosis”. Primary pooled analyses were performed on each cardiac parameter independently to determine the weighted mean difference (WMD) between SSc and controls. Further independent subgroup analyses were performed to compare symptomatic vs asymptomatic SSc and diffuse vs limited SSc. ResultsThe systematic review and meta-analysis included 41 case–control eligible reports studies with a pooled sample size of 2497 SSc cases and 1439 controls. Significant weighted mean differences (WMD) between SSc patients and healthy controls were identified in septal S’ wave (WMD 0.343 cm/s, CI [− 0.540–0.145], I2: 36%, p = 0.001), lateral S’ wave (WMD 0.795 cm/s, CI [− 1.394–0.197], I2: 0%, p = 0.009), tricuspid S’ wave (WMD 1.137 cm/s, CI [− 1.784–0.489], I2: 84%, p = 0.001), septal e’ wave (WMD 1.398 cm/s, CI [− 2.272–0.523], I2: 82%, p = 0.002) and lateral e’ wave (WMD 3.545 cm/s, CI [− 4.990–2.100], I2: 71%, p < 0.001) velocities. STE parameters were attenuated in patients with SSc, with impairment of left ventricular global longitudinal (WMD 2.765%, CI [− 3.482–2.049], I2: 91%, p < 0.001), circumferential (WMD 3.145%, CI [− 4.181–2.109], I2: 79%, p < 0.001), and radial (WMD 4.044%, CI [− 6.199–1.889], I2: 0%, p < 0.001) strain, right ventricular free wall (WMD 4.492%, CI [− 6.048–2.937], I2: 76%, p < 0.001) and right ventricular global longitudinal strain (WMD 2.843%, CI [− 3.290–2.396], I2: 32%, p < 0.001), as well as left (WMD − 8.317%, CI [− 11.873–4.761], I2: 82%, p < 0.001) and right (WMD 7.346%, CI [− 10.536–4.156], I2: 26%, p < 0.001) atrial reservoir strain.ConclusionSSc is associated with significantly impaired cardiac function and mechanics compared to healthy individuals, even in the absence of symptoms or pulmonary hypertension.Graphical Abstract\nSupplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s44156-025-00081-4.", "body": "IntroductionSystemic sclerosis (SSc) or scleroderma is a rare connective tissue disease with a complex and far from understood pathophysiology. Vascular insult, tissue fibrosis and complex immune interactions are the hallmarks of the disease, which in time affect multiple organs, including the heart [1]. SSc has the highest case-specific mortality of all the collagen vascular disorders, with prognosis being greatly impacted by the systemic involvement and end-organ damage [1]. Of these, the cardiopulmonary complications are the leading cause of mortality in SSc, with cardiac involvement alone accounting for 36% of deaths [2, 3]. A wide variety of cardiac abnormalities occur in systemic sclerosis, including myocardial fibrosis, epicardial or microvascular coronary artery disease, left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction, pericardial disease, as well supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. While pulmonary hypertension (PH) is the better-known and most feared cardiac complication, understanding and detecting the SSc primary heart involvement (SSc-pHI) is the focus of current research efforts [5]. The SSc-pHI is acknowledged as comprising cardiac abnormalities that are predominantly attributable to SSc, rather than other causes and/or complications, which may be subclinical and must be confirmed through diagnostic investigations [5]. Clinically detected cardiac involvement is recognized in only 15–25% of patients, while the rate of detection in asymptomatic patients is dependent on the diagnostic method used [6, 7]. As such, when sensitive tools are used, subclinical cardiac involvement can be proven in 70 to 100% of patients [8–10]. Accurate and early diagnosis of myocardial involvement in patients with SSc is of paramount importance for their prognosis with implications in their clinical management. A normal standard 2D echocardiography may fail to detect abnormalities, at least when compared to other imaging methods, such as cardiac MRI [12]. Thus, the prognostic value of a normal 2D echocardiography is limited [12]. While the cardiac MRI provides valuable incremental prognostic value, it is not widely available and may not be cost-efficient as a first-line imaging method. Tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) and speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE) are emerging as more sensitive and reproducible tools in various clinical scenarios, including systemic autoimmune diseases [13, 14]. Comprehensive data reporting the discrepancies in all TDI and STE parameters between patients with SSc and healthy controls are lacking. A previous similar meta-analysis previously investigated only STE parameters [15].MethodsThis systematic review aimed to gather the available data regarding TDI and tissue myocardial deformation assessed by STE in patients with SSc compared to healthy controls. Further to this, we were also interested in comparing asymptomatic patients with SSc to healthy as controls, as well patients with diffuse and limited SSc to healthy controls.The literature search was performed with adherence to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol for reporting on systematic reviews and metanalysis.To this aim, a protocol for this research was initially developed, detailing the objectives, search strategy and criteria used for study selection, and registered in the international prospective register of systematic reviews, PROSPERO (CRD42022301267) [16].Search strategySystematic search for relevant articles was conducted in three databases: MEDLINE via PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science Core Collection. In order to identify all available studies which included TDI and/or STE data in patients with SSc, multiple broad search hedges were created specifically for each database, using the following search terms: (“speckle tracking” OR “global strain” OR “longitudinal strain” OR “circumferential strain” OR “radial strain” OR “atrial strain” OR “right ventricular strain” OR “left ventricular strain”) AND “systemic sclerosis”. The search was restricted to records published in English between the 1 st of January 2000 up to and including the 23rd of October 2023. Inclusion criteriaAccording to the pre-specified protocol, only case–control studies reporting TDI and STE data in patients with SSc, in whom diagnosis was supported by relevant criteria (LeRoy, ACR-EULAR) and with healthy individuals as controls were included [17, 18]. Studies had to report values (means with standard deviation or standard error) of at least one of the following echocardiographic parameters: left ventricular (LV) TDI parameters: septal s’ wave, septal e’ wave, septal a’ wave, lateral wall s’ wave, lateral wall e’ wave, lateral wall a’ wave, LV strain parameters, such as: global longitudinal strain (GLS), circumferential strain (GCS), radial strain (GRS), left atrial (LA) strain parameters: reservoir, conduit, and contractile strain, right ventricular (RV) TDI parameters: free wall s’ wave, RV strain parameters: free wall strain (FWS), global longitudinal strain (RV GLS), or right atrial (RA) strain parameters.Exclusion criteriaStudies which were not designed as case–control were excluded. Congress abstracts, short research letters, studies with insufficient data or particularly, case–control studies in which the control population was not made up of healthy individuals, were not included. Studies concerning the paediatric population or animal studies were also excluded. Pulmonary hypertension (PH), coronary heart disease, presence of cardiac related symptoms, or use of immunosuppressive therapies were not used as exclusion criteria, but these aspects were noted for each study, when mentioned by authors.Study eligibilityThe reference lists of retrieved articles were manually reviewed, and a search for duplicates was conducted after merging the three reference lists. Two reviewers, M.C. and A.D. independently reviewed the titles and available abstracts to judge their relevance for inclusion in analysis. Subsequently, the full text of these potentially eligible reports were fully assessed based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Selection results showed a high inter-reader agreement. Discrepancies between the two independent reviewers (M.C. and A.D.) were settled by a third author’s opinion (R.J.). Study quality assessment and data extractionThe risk of bias and methodological quality of the included studies was measured using the Newcastle–Ottawa Quality Assessment Form for Case–Control Studies (NOS) [20]. NOS is a tool designed for the assessment of non-randomized studies, judged on the categories: selection, comparability and exposure; with a maximum achievable score of 9 stars. For the purpose of subgroup analysis, study quality was determined as ‘high’ with a NOS of 8 or 9. Two researchers (M.C. and A.D.) independently scored each of the included papers and resolved any discrepancies via consensus. Using the same standardized spreadsheet, two reviewers (M.C. and A.D.) performed the data extraction from all the eligible reports included.Statistical analysisAll statistical analysis was performed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Version 3, Biostat, Englewood, NJ, USA). Primary pooled analyses were performed on each cardiac parameter independently to determine the weighted mean difference (WMD) between SSc and controls. Further independent subgroup analyses were performed to compare symptomatic vs asymptomatic SSc and diffuse vs limited SSc. Where possible, meta-regression analyses were also performed to assess the effect of NOS study quality scoring on the relevant parameter. Statistical heterogeneity was tested alongside the pooled primary and subgroup analyses and reported as the I2 statistic. A 40% threshold was determined a priori, with heterogeneity above this point considered significant. Fixed effects analysis was preferred unless the I2 statistic was beyond this threshold, in which a random-effects analysis was selected as suggested when interstudy variability is confirmed through significant heterogeneity [19]. Furthermore, a post-hoc Egger’s regression test was systematically planned to assess the presence of funnel plot asymmetry with consideration of potential publication bias [20].ResultsLiterature searchA total of 298 studies were identified in the three databases using the search terms. The search for duplicates led to exclusion of 129 articles. The remaining 169 articles had their abstracts retrieved and underwent selection using an automated search followed by a manual screen process. 108 articles were sought for retrieval. Out of them, 97 articles were assessed for eligibility. 56 records were excluded after the full-text assessment. One article was excluded because it reported data from patients with SSc and other connective tissue diseases, and the authors were not able to extract the relevant data concerning only patients with SSc [21]. Finally, the results of 41 articles were included in analysis. The PRISMA flow diagram presents the overview of the selection process (see Fig. 1).Fig. 1PRISMA flow diagram according to [16]Most studies mentioned including patients with limited SSc and diffuse SSc, with one study including only patients with diffuse SSc [22]. PH was confirmed by the authors in 8 studies [23–29], but not all studies mentioned performing right-heart catheterization. Only one study explored the effects of a therapeutic agent (namely Bosentan) on the myocardial function of the SSc patients [31]. Symptoms were inconsistently acknowledged in the articles included. 20 studies included only asymptomatic patients [6, 7, 22, 23, 27, 32–44], while only 3 studies specifically declared enrolling symptomatic patients [25, 28, 29]. Unfortunately, the studies did not consistently acknowledge the presence of traditional cardiovascular risk factors or other comorbidities, which may influence the echocardiographic findings.Most studies reported TDI and/or STE data for the left and/or right ventricle evaluation, with 6 studies also reporting STE measurements for the left atrium [27, 46–49] and 3 studies for the right atrium [50, 51]. We identified studies which further explored the myocardial function by performing exercise echocardiography [53–55]. Data reporting on multimodality cardiac imaging was found in 3 studies, adding the assessment of myocardial inflammation by PET-CT to TDI and STE data, as well as myocardial tissue characterization through CMR [31, 57, 58]. The 41 studies included in analysis counted for a total number of 2497 SSc cases and 1439 controls. This is merely an estimation, as some studies have been conducted by the same research groups, sharing the respective patient database. In the assessment of potential publication bias, Egger’s regression analyses were run for each pooled analysis, revealing evidence of funnel plot asymmetry for LA conduit strain, LV GRS, E/e’ ratio and RVFWS.Echocardiography parametersLeft ventricleA total of 36 studies reported a 2D assessment of the left ventricular systolic function through left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) while 24 of them also reported TDI and/or STE parameters. We found that the LVEF was significantly lower in SSc patients when compared to healthy control (WMD 1.123%, CI [− 1.631–0.614], I2: 56%, p < 0.001). In addition, two sub-analyses were conducted. There were no significant differences between asymptomatic (WMD 0.721%, CI [− 1.550, 0.108], p = 0.088), with diffuse (WMD 1.536%, CI [− 3.242, 0.170], p = 0.078) or limited SSc patients (WMD 0.097%, CI [-− 1.527, 1.720], p = 0.907) and healthy controls.LV GLS was reported in 24 studies (see Fig. 2) [59, 60]. LV GLS was significantly altered in patients with SSc compared to healthy controls (WMD 2.765%, CI [− 3.482–2.049], I2: 91%, p < 0.001). The difference remained significant when studies including only asymptomatic patients were analysed (WMD 3.227%, CI [− 4.143–2.311], p < 0.001). The differences were also significant among the two forms of the disease and healthy controls, (diffuse SSc (WMD 4.026%, CI [− 5.840–2.212], p < 0.001), limited (WMD 3.010%, CI [− 4.715–1.306], p = 0.001).Fig. 2Difference in means in global longitudinal strain (GLS) between patients with SSc and controlsLV GRS values were reported by 6 studies [7, 22, 39, 42, 43, 49]. LV GRS was significantly lower in patients with SSc (WMD 4.044%, CI [− 6.199–1.889], I2: 0%, p < 0.001)/LV GCS was mentioned in 9 studies [7, 22, 26, 39, 41, 42, 49, 61]. LV GCS showed significant differences between SSc patients and healthy controls (WMD 3.145%, CI [− 4.181–2.109], I2: 79%, p < 0.001). Assessment of the LV longitudinal systolic function through TDI parameters using the septal and lateral s’ waves was reported in 9 [6, 22, 24, 32, 36, 37, 42, 47, 53, 62] and 5 studies [6, 23, 24, 32, 47], respectively. Both the septal and lateral s’ wave velocities showed significantly lower values in SSc patients compared to healthy controls (septal s’ wave: WMD 0.343 cm/s, CI [− 0.540–0.145], I2: 36%, p = 0.001), lateral s’ wave (WMD 0.795 cm/s, CI [− 1.394–0.197], I2: 0%, p = 0.009).Diastolic function, assessed using the E/A ratio, was reported in 18 studies. The ratio was significantly lower in patients with systemic sclerosis (WMD 0.140, CI [− 0.201–0.078], I2: 67%, p < 0.001). The estimated LV filling pressure (based on the E/e’ ratio) was reported in 18 studies, estimated as significantly higher in affected individuals (WMD 1.683, CI [0.920, 2.447], I2: 90%, p < 0.001) (see Fig. 3). Consequently, the septal e’ (WMD 1.398 cm/s, CI [− 2.272–0.523], I2: 82%, p = 0.002) and lateral e’ (WMD 3.545 cm/s, CI [− 4.990–2.100], I2: 71%, p < 0.001) wave velocities, which were reported in 11 [6, 24, 25, 32, 35, 42, 47, 49, 50, 53, 62] and 5 studies [6, 23, 24, 32, 47, 50], respectively, were significantly lower in affected individuals. The septal and lateral a’ wave velocities were not significantly different between patients with SSc and healthy controls.Fig. 3Difference in means in E/e’ ratio between patients with SSc and controlsLeft atriumThere were 8 studies that reported the indexed left atrial volume (LAVi) [26, 27, 33, 39, 43, 48, 50, 53]. This was found to be significantly higher in individuals with SSc compared to healthy controls (WMD 3.003 ml/m2, CI [1.253–4.753], I2: 77%, p = 0.001). STE analysis of the left atrium included the reservoir, conduit and contraction strain. The reservoir strain was performed in 6 studies [27, 46–49] and showed a significant impairment in patients with SSc (WMD 8.317%, CI [− 11.873–4.761], I2: 82%, p < 0.001) (see Fig. 4). A significant difference was also seen in the conduit strain (WMD 2.875%, CI [− 4.947–0.804], I2: 53%, p = 0.007), which was performed in 4 studies [46–48]. The contraction strain was performed in 4 studies, without any significant differences being found [27, 46, 47].Fig. 4Difference in means in left atrium reservoir strain between patients with SSc and controlsRight ventricleA total of 22 studies included TDI and/or STE data concerning RV systolic function. TAPSE was reported in 22 studies, out of which 6 mentioned including patients with PH [23, 24, 28, 29]. TAPSE was significantly reduced in individuals with SSc compared to healthy controls (WMD 2.299 mm, CI [− 3.382–1.216], I2: 93%, p < 0.001). The difference remained significant when only patients without PH were considered (WMD 2.428 mm, CI [− 3.960–0.896], p = 0.002).RV FAC was reported by 13 studies and found to be significantly reduced in the SSc patients (WMD 3.317%, CI [− 5.179–0.772], I2: 80%, p = 0.002). However, the difference lost its significance when RV FAC was compared exclusively between asymptomatic SSc patients and healthy controls (WMD 2.548%, CI [− 6.750–1.654], p = 0.235) [22, 33, 38, 40, 41, 44]. RVEF assessed by 3D echocardiography was performed in only 2 studies, which did not include patients with PAH [38, 40]. The RVEF was significantly lower in affected individuals (WMD 10.491%, CI [− 13.431–7.551], I2: 64%, p < 0.001).The right ventricular free wall s’ wave was reported by 13 studies, 3 of them also including patients with PH [23, 25, 26]. Patients with SSc had significantly lower s’ velocities compared to healthy controls (WMD 1.137 cm/s, CI [− 1.784–0.489], I2: 84%, p = 0.001). The difference remained significant even after studies including patients with PH were excluded (WMD 1.280 cm/s, CI [− 2.135–0.426], p = 0.003).RVFWS was reported in 7 studies, with values being significantly more impaired in individuals with SSc (WMD 4.492%, CI [− 6.048–2.937], I2: 76%, p < 0.001) (see Fig. 5). One study also included patients with PH [30]. Its exclusion did not alter the difference (WMD 4.647%, CI [− 6.488–2.806], p < 0.001). More studies [15] reported RV GS, which was found to be significantly attenuated in patients with SSc (WMD 2.843%, CI [− 3.290–2.396], I2: 32%, p < 0.001). Only one of the studies also included patients with PH [25]. However, after its exclusion from the analysis, the difference remained significant (WMD 2.810%, CI [− 3.277–2.344], p < 0.001).Fig. 5Difference in means in right ventricular free wall strain (RV FWS) between patients with SSc and controlsRight atriumSTE analysis of the right atrium was performed in 3 studies, which did not include patients with PH [50, 51]. Right atrial reservoir strain was found to be significantly more impaired in individuals with SSc compared to healthy controls (WMD 7.346%, CI [− 10.536–4.156], p < 0.001). Right atrial conduit (WMD 5.396%, CI [− 9.098–1.693], p = 0.004) and contraction (WMD 3.216%, CI [− 4.754–1.679], p < 0.01) strain were performed in only two studies [51, 52] and showed significant differences. DiscussionIn the present systematic review and meta-analysis, we investigated TDI and STE derived parameters of cardiac mechanics in patients diagnosed with SSc compared to healthy controls. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive meta-analysis addressing this subject. Previous meta-analyses investigating these parameters in other systemic autoimmune disorders, such as SLE and RA, as well as in SSc have been published previously [14, 15, 63]. Specifically, the meta-analysis concerning patients with SSc included less studies, 31 compared to 41 in the present study, and addressed only STE parameters, without reporting TDI parameters [15]. These studies highlighted that individuals with systemic autoimmune disorders show impaired left ventricular longitudinal systolic function compared to healthy controls, quantified by GLS. Notably, impaired myocardial deformation has been confirmed in all four cardiac chambers in SSc, as the majority of STE parameters showed lower values compared to healthy controls [15]. Our study also demonstrated that LV GLS is significantly impaired in patients with SSc. Interestingly, our analysis showed a significant difference in LVEF between patients and controls, despite most studies showing similar LVEF values. However, a 1.1% difference in LVEF, although statistically significant, does not hold clinical relevance. LVEF assessed through Simpson’s bi-plane method is influenced by interobserver variability, which can vary by up to 10%. This is improved by 3D measured LVEF, however it was not routinely performed [64]. GLS reproducibility was shown to be superior to that of conventional echocardiographic measures [63, 65, 66]. The WMD in LV GLS was greater and far more clinically significant in our analysis (2.765%) compared to the WMD of 1.1% in LVEF. It has been established previously that a reduction with just 1 unit in LV GLS is associated with a 12% increased risk of major adverse cardiac events in an otherwise low-risk general population [68]. Moreover, the difference maintained its significance when asymptomatic SSc patients were compared with healthy controls, a comparison not explored in the previous meta-analysis [15]. This highlights the importance of LV GLS in identifying individuals with SSc at risk of having subclinical myocardial involvement, which would be otherwise undiagnosed if only traditional echocardiographic parameters, such as LVEF, were to be used. LV systolic dysfunction quantified by LVEF has been identified only in a minority of patients (5.2%) [69]. By contrast, myocardial abnormalities were detected in all patients by nuclear techniques and in 75% of patients when using cardiac MRI [70, 71]. Furthermore, the difference in GLS between affected individuals and healthy controls appears to be slightly greater in patients with a diffuse SSc than in those with a limited cutaneous SSc phenotype (4.0% versus 3.0%). This is in line with the higher rates of cardiac involvement reported in diffuse SSc, as the anti-Scl70 antibodies, the immune hallmark for this more clinically severe SSc phenotype, are associated with more severe systemic organ damage [72, 73]. Thus, GLS is a valuable and readily available tool, addressing an unmet clinical need. It should be systematically performed in patients with SSc, regardless of the presence of symptoms, in order to identify patients who might benefit from further investigations, close monitoring or perhaps even treatment escalation.LV GRS and GCS are more frequently used in research settings, whereas GLS is more accessible for day-to-day clinical use. In addition to the longitudinal impairment, patients with SSc also have attenuated radial and circumferential strain, suggesting all three LV contractile components are affected in a similar manner, potentially by fibrosis and/or inflammation. Myocardial tissue abnormalities, such as late-gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and edema can be identified in up to 26.4% of asymptomatic patients [75]. These findings are relevant, as there is a direct correlation between LGE and the burden of ventricular arrhythmias, which has shown prognostic significance in the Genetics versus Environment in Scleroderma Outcome Study (GENISOS) [75, 76]. Patients with ventricular arrhythmias had a 2.18-fold increase in the risk of sudden cardiac death compared to arrhythmia-free patients [76].Detecting diastolic dysfunction is important in patients with SSc, as it is a recognized mortality predictor, exceeding PH [28]. Disease-related pathogenic mechanisms, such as myocardial fibrosis, increased serum levels of tissue inhibitor matrix metalloproteinase and impaired endothelial function, contribute to the impairment of diastolic function, which explains the greater prevalence of diastolic dysfunction in patients with SSc compared to healthy individuals [74, 77]. As expected, we confirmed that the E/A ratio is significantly lower in patients with SSc, albeit the 0.14 difference might be only statistically significant and not clinically relevant. Tissue Doppler velocities are important for the assessment of LV systolic longitudinal function and diastolic function. We confirmed statistically significant differences in all TDI parameters (E/e’ ratio, septal and lateral s’ and e’ wave velocities), except for the septal and lateral a’ waves. The WMD of 1.683 for the E/e’ ratio can be clinically significant and bears prognostic significance in certain populations. For instance, a 1 unit increase in the ratio has been associated with an increased risk of mortality in most studies in patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction [78]. The greatest difference was noted in the lateral e’ wave velocities (3.545 cm/s). Some risk factors for low e’ velocities in this setting were reported to be disease duration, age and arterial hypertension [79]. Importantly, e’ wave velocities have prognostic implications, as each standard deviation decrease augments mortality rates 3.2 times [79]. Adding evidence to the greater prevalence of diastolic dysfunction, patients with SSc had significantly greater LAVi compared to healthy individuals.Left atrial reservoir strain has become clinically relevant and can be used in estimating LV filling pressures, particularly in patients with equivocal findings [80]. Values less than 18% predicted elevated LV filling pressures better than LA volume and conventional Doppler parameters in patients with preserved LVEF [81]. Left atrial reservoir strain values were lower in patients with SSc compared to healthy controls (WMD 8.317%). It should be noted that the difference seems more noteworthy compared to other parameters, such as LAVi (WMD 3 ml/m2), E/A ratio (WMD 0.14) or E/e’ ratio (WMD 1.683), prompting clinicians to routinely perform this parameter in patients with SSc. Left atrial reservoir strain offers incremental value in cardiovascular risk stratification and long-term prognosis in several distinct populations, including community-based cohorts, patients with valvular disease or cardiomyopathies, with several thresholds having been proposed in each situation [82–84]. In particular, left atrial function may demonstrate alterations prior to changes in the left atrial volume [86].As with the left-side cardiac chambers, the right ventricle and atrium may also be affected, even in the absence of PH. Right ventricular involvement is present even in the early stages of the disease in the absence of PH [62]. Early RV dysfunction is strongly associated with the presence of anti-Scl70 antibodies and extent of cutaneous and pulmonary involvement [23, 32]. Moreover, this occurs independently of the systolic pulmonary artery pressures or pulmonary function, suggesting that primary RV myocardial involvement is a distinct entity, not just a consequence of pressure overload [11]. Our analysis also confirms this aspect, as excluding patients with PH did not alter the significance of the difference seen in the velocity of the tricuspid S’ wave, RVFWS or RVGS. The clinical significance of these findings has not been established outside the context of PH, tricuspid regurgitation or heart failure. RVGS seemed more popular than RVFWS, as more studies chose to report it. However, RVFWS may hold superior prognostic value compared to RVGS, which has been demonstrated in patients with heart failure and PH [87, 88]. Adding further evidence to the concept of primary right heart involvement, all the right atrial strain indices were impaired in patients with SSc without PH, with the reservoir strain demonstrating the greatest WMD. Right atrial dysfunction is a predictor for mortality and hospitalization in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension independent of right atrial size, however its clinical implications in patients without PH are not established [89].The role of these parameters in the clinical management of patients with SSc is yet to be defined, apart from identifying higher-risk patients given their established prognostic value [90]. However, it seems clear that patients found to have abnormal cardiac mechanics should be followed up closely and perhaps referred for further investigations. These may include the assessment of ventricular arrhythmias with Holter ECG monitors, as well as other imaging techniques, such as cardiac MRI for myocardial tissue characterization. The benefit of commencing cardioprotective drugs based solely on STE parameters is yet to be determined.Study limitationsHeterogeneity was high considering the variability between studies included in the analysis, which was expected. Some of the studies reported data from a small number of patients, resulting in a low number of effect sizes included within the analysis, which would explain the wider confidence intervals of some results. Larger scale studies which are adequately powered to detect differences in some unconventional echocardiographic parameters, such as RA and LA strain, will allow for more robustly powered pooled analysis in the future. Additionally, there was evidence of funnel plot asymmetry for pooled analyses of LA conduit strain, LV GRS, E/e’ ratio and RVFWS, suggesting publication bias. Publication bias remains a potential and inherent problem with secondary pooled analyses and thus should be appropriately considered in the interpretation of the changes in for these parameters. Some studies did not specifically disclose PH and/or symptoms as part of their inclusion or exclusion criteria. While several specifically mentioned adhering to the relevant protocols and/or guidelines regarding image acquisition, it remains uncertain whether all studies reporting RV parameters relied on RV-focused views or standard four-chamber views. This of course may significantly impact the values reported for RV and RA parameters. Another concern stems from the strain imaging software used from different vendors. Studies reported using GE, Philips or Toshiba software, however not all studies disclosed this aspect in their protocol. Therefore, the impact of a potential machine-related variability on the current findings cannot be excluded. A previous inter-vendor study showed a small, yet statistically significant variation among vendors [67].ConclusionSSc is associated with significantly impaired cardiac mechanics in all four chambers compared to healthy individuals. These findings support the existence of myocardial dysfunction in SSc, which may occur in either forms of the disease, even in asymptomatic patients. Importantly, right atrial and ventricular impairment occurs even in the absence of PH. This is further evidence that they should be measured systematically and routinely in patients with SSc, regardless of symptoms or PH, as they hold prognostic significance and identify higher-risk patients.Supplementary Information\nSupplementary Material 1.Supplementary Material 2.Supplementary Material 3.Supplementary Material 4.Supplementary Material 5."}

To pursue this goal, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis following the PRISMA guidelines. The analysis included studies that utilized DCB-only or hybrid angioplasty for de novo lesions in large coronary vessel (> 2.75 mm). The primary outcome was to assess the target lesion revascularization (TLR) rate, while secondary outcomes included cardiac death, myocardial infarction (MI), and the composite of these. A total of 15 studies, comprising 3975 patients (of whom 2114 treated with DCB) were included. Median age was 62 ± 1.5 years, with 77.4% being male. Overall, 26.9% had diabetes, and 67.6% were diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome. Over a pooled follow-up of 20.6 ± 1.9 months, the incidence of TLR was 4% in the pooled DBC group. Additionally, over a pooled follow-up of 25.8 ± 2.7 months, no significant differences were observed in incidence of TLR between the DCB group and the DES group (4.3% vs. 6.9%, odds ratio 0.71, 95% confidence interval 0.50–1.01, p = 0.059). Furthermore, there were no differences in incidence of cardiac death and MI. DCB angioplasty treatment of de novo lesions in large coronary vessels could be a safe and effective strategy in both acute and chronic coronary settings. The incidence of target lesion revascularization appears to be similar to that of contemporary DES.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41598-025-85734-4.", "body": "IntroductionPercutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has evolved significantly over the past decades. The introduction of coronary stenting helped overcome main limitations of plain old balloon angioplasty, as flow-limiting dissections and elastic recoil. Subsequently, in-stent restenosis (ISR) rates due to exaggerated neointimal growth in bare-metal stents (BMS) were soon recognized, facilitating the development of drug-eluting stents (DES). However, although second generation DESs have markedly improved PCI outcomes, the ongoing risk of very-late stents events occurs in approximately 2% of patients per year, with no evident plateau, even though 5-year follow-up. Consequently, these events still pose a challenge1,2. Recently, drug-eluting balloons (DCB) have emerged as an alternative therapeutic option for ISR of BMS or DES and for de novo lesions located in small coronary vessels3. This technology allows the homogenous delivery of high concentrations of antiproliferative drug using a semi-compliant balloon, without leaving metal or polymer behind, which is associated with chronic inflammation, the trigger for late thrombosis and ISR4.Previous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have reported that DCB exhibit similar long-term clinical outcomes to DES, confirming their promising role in treatment of de novo lesion in small vessels5–8. Recently, the use of DCB-only treatment of de novo lesions in large vessels have garnered considerable attention, although it remains a subject of controversy. In order to reduce the total length of DES implanted and to shorten the duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), this strategy could be of great value, especially in the context of long and multivessel coronary artery disease, in patients at high bleeding risk (HBR) patients, and in those who are candidate to surgery9–13. Against this backdrop, the primary endpoint of the present meta-analysis is to provide a comprehensive and quantitative assessment of the safety and efficacy of DCB in de novo coronary lesions in large vessels. Additionally, we aim to compare the incidence of safety and efficacy outcomes in patients treated with DCB compared to DES in large vessels.MethodsThe present study was performed according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines14. The systematic review was registered on PROSPERO with the following identifier: CRD42024514519. The PubMed, OVID, Scopus, google Scholar and Cochrane library databases, were interrogated from inception to 30th November 2023, selecting all English-language articles that investigated the roles of DCBs for the treatment of de novo coronary lesions in large vessels. Studies were identified by using search terms, MeSH terms and keywords and crossing the following terms: “drug coated balloon”, “drug eluting balloon”, “coronary artery disease”, “de novo lesion”, “large vessel”. Three reviewers (C.G., F.G. and G.P.) independently reviewed the databases. References from relevant studies were screened for supplementary articles. We included retrospective and prospective registries, retrospective case-control studies with and without propensity-scoring matched groups, and clinical randomized trials comparing DCB and DES for the treatment of de novo lesions in large vessels. We chose the cut-off of 2.75 mm to identify large coronary arteries5,7.Main inclusion criteria were: (1) de novo lesions treated with DCB, (2) reference diameter of the target vessel > 2.75 mm or mean reference diameter > 3 mm with a standard deviation (SD) ± 0.25 mm.In most studies, the reference lumen diameter was estimated visually through angiography. Both chronic and acute clinical presentations were considered, including ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).We considered the target lesion revascularization (TLR) as the primary outcome, as it was reported in all included studies; conversely, secondary outcomes were myocardial infarction (MI), cardiac death (CD) and a composite endpoint, called target lesion failure (TLF). It is worth noting that the composite endpoint was not consistently defined across all studies or was sometimes unavailable. In most studies, TLF was defined as a combination of CD, MI, and TLR. Additionally, in three studies, (Nakamura et al., Li et al., Gitto et al.) the composite endpoint included target vessel revascularization (TVR) alongside the aforementioned endpoints”.Data extractionTwo independent investigators (F.G. and G.P.) reviewed all search results and selected the studies in accordance with inclusion criteria. When a consensus was not reached, a third reviewer was consulted for final decision (C.G). For each eligible study, we extracted data including article information (first author and year of publication), study characteristics, relevant population demographics and angiographic and procedural details. In one case we asked the corresponding author for supplementary data regarding outcomes15, and in another case we asked for a sub-analysis of patients with a reference vessel diameter > 2.75 mm16. Since all analyses were based on previous published studies, there is no requirements for ethical approval or patient consent. The investigation is in line with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.Data availabilityThe datasets used and analysed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.Statistical analysisTo calculate the pooled incidence rate of TLR, CD, MI and TLF in the populations treated with DCB, we performed a meta-analysis using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Version 2 (Biostat, Englewood, NJ) of data from all studies published. We also conducted a meta-analysis of principal baseline and angiographic characteristics of patients treated with DCB from all studies. Pooled demographic and clinical data derived from the analysis were expressed mean with standard error (SE) or event rate with confidence intervals (CI).Additionally, we calculated the pooled incidence of outcomes of DCB and DES-treated groups from controlled studies, and we compared them. In this case, results of the comparison were expressed as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CI. The limit of statistical significance was set at P < 0.05.Heterogeneity was assessed using I-square, Q, and tau-square values. Random effect models were applied when heterogeneity across studies was high (I2 > 75) and fixed models when the heterogeneity was lower (I2 < 75). Publication bias was assessed by using the funnel plot method (Trim and fill test). To assess and adjust for publication bias, this method involves estimating the number of missing studies (those that would have filled the funnel plot) and imputing them to create a more symmetrical funnel plot, thereby providing a more accurate estimate of the overall effect size17. Observed and adjusted values, their lower and upper limits have been calculated. To assess the effect of individual studies on the pooled result, we conducted a sensitivity analysis by excluding each study one by one and recalculating the combined estimates on remaining studies. The sensitivity analysis ruled out the presence of a single study effect, and no significant publication bias was detected.ResultsThe PRISMA flowchart, illustrating the search strategy and manuscript selection process, is presented in Supplementary Fig. 1. After removing duplicates, the initial literature search yielded a total of 45 papers. Among them, 12 were excluded because they also included PCI in small coronary vessels. Additionally, 6 papers were excluded due to unavailable data on reference vessel diameter, 8 were case reports or case series, and 4 were reviews, commentaries or editorials. Finally, 15 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the present meta-analysis. Of the 15 studies, 8 were retrospective case-control studies, 1 was prospective randomized trial, and 6 uncontrolled registries. The total number of patients included across these studies was 3975. Specifically, 2114 patients were treated with DCB across 15 studies. In the 9 controlled studies, 1356 patients received DCB treatment, and 1861 patients were treated with DES, resulting in a total of 3217 patients.The complete list of the included studies is provided in Tables 1 and 2. Notably, 4 studies excluded patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI)9,16,18,19, while 2 studies focused exclusively on patients with STEMI undergoing primary PCI15,24. Patients with unstable clinical presentation (such as cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrest, or requiring intubation) were excluded from all studies. Additionally, 4 studies excluded patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction (defined as left ventricular ejection fraction < 35%) or end-stage chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate, eGFR < 30 ml/min*m2)9,19,25,26. Two studies enrolled patients with lesions only in the left anterior descending artery (LAD)25,28, while another study focused on patients with lesions in left main vessel29. In all included studies, lesion preparation followed the drug coated balloon consensus document, including predilatation with non-compliant or cutting balloons, as well as calcium modifiers (intracoronary lithotripsy or rotational atherectomy)30. After lesion preparation, bailout stenting was performed in cases of residual flow-limiting dissection or significant residual stenosis. While all studies provided clinical follow-up, two studies also included angiographic planned follow-up18,25.\nTable 1Study design and baseline characteristics in DCB treated patients.ReferencesSample sizeCountry/inception dateStudy designAgeMale (%)Diabetes (%)STEMI (%)NSTEMI (%)Stable angina (%)Vos et al., 20192460Holland2014–2017Prospective trial DCB vs DES in STEMI patients57.4 ± 9.2871310000Li et al., 2022 2549China2017–2019Retrospective case–control, DCB-only vs DES strategy in ostial lesions in the left anterior descending artery61.2 ± 10.77624 n.a. n.a. n.a.Liu et al., 2022 936China2018–2019Retrospective case–control, DCB-only vs DES in the treatment of de novo left main coronary artery bifurcation lesions57.8 ± 11.480.627077.822.2Merinopoulos et al., 202316398UK2015–2019Retrospective case–control DCB-only vs DES for first presentation of stable angina n.a. n.a. n.a.00100Gitto et al., 202328139Italy2018–2022Retrospective case–control, left anterior descending PCI DES vs DCB-only PCI and those receiving hybrid PCI69.3 ± 10.2284.431 n.a. n.a. n.a.Gunawardena et al, 2023.2941UK2014–2019Retrospective case–control; DCB vs II-generation DES for de novo unprotected LMS disease73.8 ± 11.785.43112.256.131.7Merinopoulos et al, 2023.15452UK2016–2019Retrospective case–control, DCB-only vs II-generation DES only for first presentation of STEMI66 ± 13731410000Nakamura et al., 20231873Japan2016–2018Retrospective case–control, DCB vs DES in electively patients67.1 ± 11.484.94900100Pan et al., 2023 19108China2015–2019Retrospective case–control, DCB-only or hybrid strategies in de novo ostial lesions in the LAD or LCx58.8 ± 10.371.334061.138.9Yu et al.,201920200China2014–2017Retrospective registry, large vessel disease group (RD) ≥ 2.8 mm vs small vessel disease group DCB-only PCI61.7 ± 11.374.527289.58.5Liu et al., 201921120China2016–2017Prospective registry, feasibility, safety, and efficacy of DCB only PCI in vessels exceeding 3.0 mm57.6 ± 11.378309.178.312.5Lu et al., 20192292ChinaProspective registry, DCB in de novo lesions in large coronary artery52.3 ± 10.778.3195.445.748.9Rosenberg et al., 201923134Europe/MalaysiaRetrospective registry, efficacy of DCB as a stand-alone-therapy in de novo lesions63.4 ± 11.888.13511.95038.1Hu et al., 2022 26119China2017–2020Prospective registry, DCB-only strategy for the treatment of de novo bifurcation and non-bifurcation lesions55.3 ± 10.8722413788Leone et al., 20232793Italy2020–2022Retrospective registry, DCB angioplasty or hybrid for de novo lesions68 ± 118925 n.a.1783DCB drug coated balloon, DES drug eluting stent, STEMI ST-elevation myocardial infarction, NSTEMI non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, LMS left main stem, LAD left anterior descending, LCx Left Circumflex artery. n.a., not available.\n\nTable 2Angiographic characteristics in DCB treated patients.ReferencesLAD (%)LCx (%)RCA (%)Reference vessel diameter (mm)Lesion length (mm)Bifurcation (%)Severe calcification (%)Multivessel disease (%)Paclitaxel eluting ballon (%)Hybrid approach (%)Bailout DES (%)Vos et al., 2019 243220483.28 ± 0.52n.a.n.a.026.7100n.a.18Li et al., 2022 25100003.36 ± 0.4519.1 ± 5.7100241100n.a.n.a.Liu et al., 2022 986.147.203.48 ± 0.56n.a.1000100n.a.n.a.n.a.Merinopoulos et al. 202316n.rn.rn.rn.rn.a.n.a.n.a.n.a.n.a.n.a.n.a.Gitto et al., 2023 28100003.12 ± 0.4862.2 ± 31.430.9n.a.23.714.470.510.8Gunawardena et al, 2023.29100003.84 ± 0.2621.7 ± 7.873.24.8n.a.1000n.a.Merinopoulos et al., 2023154317393.32 ± 0.3725 ± 7.442153.810005.3Nakamura et al., 20231834.223.339.72.98 ± 0.418.4 ± 4.315.16.849.3100n.a.n.a.Pan et al., 2023 1973.126.803.43 ± 0.426.4 ± 14.31007.41n.a.10050.936.25Yu et al., 20192045.522.530.23.24 ± 0.3915.5 ± 5.7n.a.6.874100n.a.0.5Liu et al. 20192164.41718.53.09 ± 0.3117.5 ± 7.8n.a.7.4n.a.100n.a.1.6Lu et al., 20192269.17.520.23.32 ± 0.4612.3 ± 3.5na.0n.a.100n.a.6.4Rosenberg et al., 20192342.92626.63.15 ± 0.2617.6 ± 8.316.921.4351008n.a.Hu et al., 2022 2656.528.315.23.1 ± 0.314.2 ± 6.655.4n.a.n.a.100n.a.n.a.Leone et al. 2023274825283.2 ± 0.345 ± 26n.a.n.a.n.a.23306LAD left anterior descending, LCx left circumflex artery, RCA right coronary artery, DCB drug coated balloon. n.a., not available.\nBaseline clinical and angiographic characteristics of patients treated with DCBClinical and angiographic characteristics are reported in Tables 1 and 2. Regarding the 2114 patients treated with DCB-based PCI, the majority were male (77.4%, data from 14 studies, n = 1716) with a mean age of 62.1 ± 1.5 years (data from 14 studies, n = 1716), as shown in Tables 1 and 2. Among them, 358 (26.9%) were diagnosed with diabetes (14 studies, n = 1716). Many studies focused on patients with acute coronary syndrome (67.6%, 13 studies, n = 1926), and the majority of treated were located in the LAD (59%, 14 studies, n = 1716). Most studies used DCB coated with Paclitaxel (98%, 13 studies, n = 1680). The mean reference diameter of the target vessel was 3.24 ± 0.01 mm (14 studies, n = 1716), and the mean lesion length of 24.44 ± 2.04 mm (11 studies, n = 1547). The PCI involved a bifurcation in 53.7% of cases (9 studies, n = 1151), and 39.4% of patients presented with multivessel coronary artery disease (9 studies, n = 1143). In 8.2% of cases (9 studies, n = 1264), bailout stenting was necessary after lesion preparation or following DCB implantation due to flow-limiting dissection or residual stenosis of the treated lesion.Clinical outcomes in DCB-treated populationConsidering the entire population of patients treated with DCB, at a mean follow up of 20.6 ± 1.9 months (data from 15 studies, n = 2114), the TLR, the primary outcome occurred in 4% of patients (95% CI 3.2–5.0%; 15 studies, n = 2114). As secondary endpoints, CD occurred in 3.5% of patients (95% CI 2.7–4.5%, 15 studies, n = 2114), MI in 5.7% (95% CI 4.5–7.0%, 15 studies, n = 2114), while TLF was observed in 5.3% of cases (95% CI 4.1–6.8, 12 studies, n = 1223; Supplemental Table 1).Clinical outcomes in DCB versus DES groupIn controlled studies comparing DCB and DES-treated patients (9 studies, 3217 subjects), the mean follow-up was 25.8 ± 2.7 months in the DCB-group (9 studies, n = 1356) and 26.8 ± 2.8 months in the DES group (9 studies, n = 1861). The mean age (63.9±1.8 vs. 64.8±1.5 years) and the proportion of patients presenting with ACS (61% vs. 58%) were comparable between the DCB and DES groups. Notably, there was a trend towards less TLR in DCB than DES (4.3% vs. 6.9%; OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.49–1.01, p = 0.059), although statistical significance was not reached (Fig. 1). MI occurred in 6.4% of patients treated with DCB vs. 5.9% with DES (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.77–1.49, p = 0.649, 9 studies, n = 3217) (Fig. 2). CD occurred in 4.0% vs. 4.7% (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.62–1.33, I219%, p = 0.351, 9 studies, n = 3217) (Fig. 3). Importantly, TLF occurred significantly less in DCB-treated group (6.1% vs. 16.0%, OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.22–0.59, p < 0.001, 6 studies, n = 938; Supplemental Tables 2 and in Fig. 4).\nFig. 1Forest plot for target lesion revascularization (TLR) in DCB and DES treated patients.

Furthermore, over a pooled follow-up of 25.8 ± 2.7 months vs. 26.8 ± 2.8 months, DCB was associated with a trend toward a lower rate of TLR compared with patients treated with DES, although statistical significance was not reached. As secondary outcomes, no statistically significant difference in the incidence of CD and MI was found between the two groups, while the composite endpoint resulted significantly less frequent in DCB-treated patients.At a mean follow up of 20.6 ± 1.9 months, the rate of TLR at 4% aligns with reported stent-related adverse events. Indeed, in a meta-analysis, Madhavan et al. postulated that among 13,380 patients treated with II generation DES, very-late ischemic events, occurred in approximately 2% of patients per year, with no plateau evident. During a follow-up period between 1- and 5-years, ischemia-driven TLR occurred in 4.4% of patients1. Moreover, our results revealed that compared to the recently available DES, DCB-only angioplasty for de novo lesions in large coronary arteries showed similar trends in terms of TLR (OR = 0.71, 95% CI 4.9 ± 1.01, I2 56%, p = 0.059).The trend toward a lower risk of TLR and the lower incidence of the composite endpoint in DCB group observed in our meta-analysis was mainly affected by the studies of Gitto et al.28 and Pan et al.19. Gitto et al. reported a 2-year incidence of TLR and consequently of the composite TLF group significantly higher in DES group compared to DCB (14.6% vs. 3.5% and 18.2% vs. 3.5% respectively); the authors themselves state that the main reason behind these unusual findings were LAD lesion length (until 65 mm (40–82) mm in the DCB group vs. 56 (46–66) mm in the DES group). This may indicate a more significant effect of the use of DCB in the context of diffuse atherosclerotic disease and long lesions, which are at a higher risk of ISR. Moreover, according to authors, the other reasons that may explain this finding is due to the repeated coronary angiographies for staged non-LAD revascularization, leading to an overestimation of non–clinically-driven TVR. Interestingly, they postulated the greater benefit in terms of TLR with longer follow-up. Most TLR occurred within the first 6 months in the DCB group, after which there was a plateau. In contrast, the DES showed a steadily growing TLR incidence in the DES group which is the natural history of stent-related negative vascular remodelling. However, it is essential to consider that the DCB population was treated with an hybrid approach in 70.8%, the highest rate among the studies included in the meta-analysis. This strategy was adopted at operator’s discretion, taking into account the distal coronary-to-aortic pressure ratio post-lesion preparation28.In the study by Pan et al., after a propensity-matched sample, the authors reported an incidence of TLR of 4.9% in DCB group and 16.3% in the DES group. Additionally, the incidence of MACE (a composite of CD, target vessel MI and vessel thrombosis) of 7.8% in DCB group and 19.39% in the DES group. This discrepancy might be explained by the study’s inclusion of only ostial LAD lesions (Medina classification 0,1,0). Ostial LAD lesions are traditionally considered a complex angioplasty, where optimal stent positioning is crucial to avoid acute and chronic complications. However, this limitation is overcome by balloon only angioplasty. Interestingly, the study revealed a significantly higher late lumen loss in DES group during follow-up compared to DCB group (0.30 ± 0.27 mm vs. − 0.02 ± 0.57 mm, p < 0.001), effectively negating the advantage of the higher acute lumen gain observed after DES implantation (2.21 ± 0.52 mm vs. 1.63 ± 0.47 mm, p < 0.001). Possible explanations for this discrepancy include stent recoil or a negative remodeling including, which may involve neointimal hyperplasia or neoatherosclerosis19.“Leave nothing behind strategy”Recently, a growing body of evidence has been published on the DES-limiting approach, which appears to be an encouraging strategy for overcoming stent-related adverse events mainly caused by the inflammatory reaction to stent and polymer. Plain-old balloon angioplasty (POBA) for coronary revascularization, was limited by acute elastic recoil and neointimal hyperplasia causing restenosis in about 30–40% of patients in the first 6 to 9 months. These limitations necessitated further technological advancement, leading in the introduction of coronary artery stents. However, despite contemporary DES markedly improving 1-year outcomes compared to BMS, the persistent occurrence of stent-derived adverse events, such as those described above, still poses a considerable cumulating risk. These DES limitations have spurred innovation for improved solutions, including the coronary vessel delivery of drugs via non-metallic-based platforms, such as DCB. Paclitaxel was identified as the primary drug for DCB due to its high lipophilic property and its ability to inhibit cell division and migration through irreversible binding to microtubules. This explains its long-lasting effects, lasting up to 12 days. In a recent meta-analysis by B. Scheller et al., including 26 RCTs published between 2006 and 2019, the use of paclitaxel DCB for treatment of coronary artery disease was associated with lower risk of death at longer-term follow-up when compared with non-DCB devices (such as conventional balloon angioplasty, bare-metal stents, or drug-eluting stents) in coronary intervention31. Despite the short exposure of the vessel wall, the bioavailability of paclitaxel is sufficient to achieve an arterial wall concentration high enough to reduce the process of restenosis. It is supposed that this phenomenon begins in the first days after the barotrauma induced by angioplasty32.From “leave nothing-” to “leave as little as possible-” behind strategyThe interest in this alternative strategy initially pertained the treatment of ISR and de novo lesions of small vessels. RCTs assessing the safety and efficacy of DCB-only strategy in de novo lesions of large vessels are lacking. Recently, the open-label, randomized, REC-CAGEFREE I trial did not achieve non-inferiority comparing a strategy of DCB angioplasty with rescue stenting with the intended DES implantation in de novo, non-complex coronary artery disease, in terms of the device-oriented composite endpoint (including CV, target vessel MI, and clinically and physiologically indicated TLR) assessed at 24 months. Of note, in a subgroup analysis of small- and non-small vessel disease (Reference Vessel Diameter < and > 3 mm, respectively), the authors found similar rates of DoCE between DCB and DES group in small vessel disease, while DES seemed to be more favorable in large vessel disease subpopulation (7.5% of DoCE in the DCB group vs. 2.5% in the DES group). Nevertheless, this subgroup analysis was not adjusted for multiple comparison and should be interpreted as explorative only. Notably, the Kaplan–Meier cumulative incidence curves of DoCE and its component endpoint between the DCB and DES groups began to diverge at approximately 100 days, favoring DES. This finding could be explained by the shorter local retention of the anti-proliferative drug which is typically 1 month for paclitaxel-coated balloons. Nevertheless, there is still limited randomized controlled trial (RCT) data focused on the safety and efficacy of DCB in large coronary artery disease. Of note, the “Drug-Coated Balloon versus Drug-Eluting Stent for Clinical Outcomes in Patients With Large Coronary Artery Disease (REVERSE)” a prospective, randomized, open-label, international multicenter trial is ongoing (ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT05846893). The aim of study is to demonstrate the non-inferiority of drug-coated balloon (DCB) treatment compared to current-generation drug-eluting stenting (DES) in patients with large coronary artery disease (reference vessel diameter ≥ 3.0 mm by visual estimation) only33. Some other RCTs are ongoing and their results will be crucial to better evaluate the performance of DCBs in this clinical setting34,35.Moreover, this strategy, may be of great interest in treating anatomical settings such as bifurcations and long lesions. Current guidelines support the use of stenting of main branch (MB) with provisional stenting of the side branch as a default strategy, and in this setting, the use of DCB for side branch may be preferable to balloon angioplasty alone36. DCB-only strategy allows to reduce total stent length, which is one of the most important predisposing factors for ISR37. Furthermore, this strategy may also be of great interest in selected subsets, such as high-bleeding risk patients, where a ‘leave nothing behind’ strategy could offer a reduction of bleeding risk by means of a reduced duration of DAPT12,13. Lesion preparation is the cornerstone in the DCB-only strategy. To ensure sufficient initial acute lumen gain, optimal pre-dilation is required, sometimes leading to severe dissection. Indeed, according to an international consensus on the use of DCBs, the presence of coronary artery flow-limiting dissection and a significant residual stenosis after pre-dilatation are considered as a contraindication to DCB-only strategy30. In these cases, the implantation of a DES is considered mandatory. It has been suggested that de novo coronary lesions treated with DCB show persistent anatomical and physiological patency with plaque redistribution and vessel remodelling at invasive follow-up.Indeed, Poerner et al. conducted an invasive follow up at 6-months after 47 DCB-only fractional flow reserve (FFR)-guided angioplasties using Optical coherence tomography (OCT). They found a trend toward positive vessel remodelling with late lumen enlargement (LLE) in DCB-only PCI, postulating that clinically silent type A and B dissections were mostly healed38. These results were corroborated by Ann et al. who performed an invasive follow-up with ultrasound-virtual histology (IVUS-VH) to assess plaque composition. They discovered that after DCB-only PCI, the mean vessel area and lumen area significantly increased after 9 months, while the percent of atheroma volume decreased significantly (although plaque compositions remained unchanged)39. Interestingly, a recent study from Yamamoto et al. showed that the presence of medial dissection with an arc > 90° after DCB treatment predicted LLE at follow-up40.However, the use of DCB for complex lesions, such as calcified plaque remains a controversial indication. Calcified lesions are known to have higher incidences of restenosis and stent thrombosis than non-calcified lesions following PCI with DES. An autoptic study revealed that inter-strut distance frequently observed in stent struts malapposition or stent underexpansion in heavily calcified plaque leads to a local drug gradient, which is the primary mechanism of DES restenosis41.Moreover, PCI using DCB after preparation of calcified with rotational atherectomy in patients with calcified de novo lesions appears to be safe as shown by Rissanen et al. This strategy could offer many advantages over stenting in calcified lesions, such as lower risk of application of an undersized stent42.Conversely, as underlined by Nakamura et al.18, DES are more commonly used including diffuse, calcified lesions, long-balloon-treated and debulking device-used lesions, or preprocedural smaller Minimal Lumen Diameter (MLD). These lesion features result in a lower probability of optimal lesion preparation and a higher risk of dissection and acute recoil after pre-dilatation. Given these considerations, we should move beyond the concept of ‘Leave nothing behind’ and adopt a more pragmatic approach (i.e., ‘Leave as little as possible behind’ strategy). This approach combines the advantages of using stents in terms of feasibility and safety concerning dissections or calcified lesions, while still allowing long segments of vessels to remain free from a metal cage. Notably, most studies on DCB included a variable proportion of patients treated with the hybrid approach, with some studies reporting rates as high as 70%.Moreover, it has been proposed that treatment with DCB may preserve endothelial function. The administration of acetylcholine resulted in less pronounced vasoconstriction in peri-treated region in DCB-treated vessels than in DES-treated vessels43. Additionally, DCB-treated vessels exhibit a similar vasomotor function compared to normal coronary segments44.LimitationsThe main limitation of our meta-analysis is that we included non-randomized clinical trials. Therefore, it will be necessary to wait for the evidence from numerous ongoing randomized trials before drawing definitive conclusion on the safety and efficacy of DCB-only angioplasty in large coronary vessel. Moreover, this is a summary and not patient level meta-analysis. Another limitation is the heterogeneity of the composite endpoint definition of TLF. Nevertheless, we decided to also include this outcome in our study, despite its intrinsic methodological limitation. Moreover, even if DCB do not have a “class effect”, we have not conducted a specifical sub-analysis according to each device or antiproliferative drug due to the lack of data.ConclusionsThis is the largest comprehensive meta-analysis summarizing currently available data on feasibility, safety, and efficacy of DCB strategy for treating de novo lesions in large coronary vessels. Despite the lack of evidence from large, randomized trials, we can speculate that DCB PCI in large coronary vessels, especially if assisted by a thoughtful use of DES, is safe and effective.Electronic supplementary materialBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material.\nSupplementary Material 1"}

Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms have leveraged heart rate variability (HRV) patterns to enhance the accuracy of AF identification.MethodsWe conducted a systematic review of the literature by searching four major biomedical databases—PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library—spanning from their inception to December 13, 2024, following the PRISMA guidelines. We extracted data on true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives from the included studies, which were then synthesized to evaluate sensitivity and specificity comprehensively.ResultsOur final analysis included 12 diagnostic studies. Hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic modeling revealed excellent discriminative ability, with a pooled sensitivity of 0.94 and specificity of 0.97. In detecting AF, the AI model demonstrated exceptional performance (sensitivity = 0.96, specificity = 0.99, AUC = 1.00). Subgroup analyses revealed that both deep learning algorithms (sensitivity = 0.95, specificity = 0.98, AUC = 0.99) and multi-database studies (sensitivity = 0.96, specificity = 0.97, AUC = 0.99) demonstrated enhanced accuracy in AF identification compared to other approaches.ConclusionMachine learning can effectively identify AF with HRV in ECG, especially in diagnosis and detection, with deep learning algorithms and multiple-databases outperforming other diagnostic methods.Systematic Review Registrationhttps://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/, PROSPERO (CRD42025634406).", "body": "1IntroductionAtrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common persistent arrhythmia encountered in clinical practice, and its global disease burden continues to increase as the acceleration of aging population (1).

Currently, the clinical diagnosis of AF largely depends on patient-reported symptoms and electrocardiogram (ECG) results. However, existing evidence suggests that these traditional methods are associated with a misdiagnosis rate of approximately 20% (3). This diagnostic uncertainty may result in excessive treatment, increasing patient burdens and inefficient resource allocation. As a result, the development of innovative and accurate diagnostic technologies has become a critical priority to enhance the diagnostic approach for AF.Heart rate variability (HRV), which quantifies fluctuations in beat-to-beat intervals, has become an established tool in clinical prediction models for sudden cardiac death and life-threatening arrhythmia (4). Notably, recent advancements integrating wearable or implantable HRV data with artificial intelligence (AI)-based analytical systems have facilitated novel strategies for the early detection of AF and precision risk stratification (5, 6).AI systems replicate human cognitive processes through autonomous decision-making architectures, with their inherent strength rooted in hierarchical pattern recognition and deep processing of complex datasets. In the field of cardiovascular medicine, machine learning (ML)-enhanced ECG interpretation has demonstrated measurable improvements in predictive performance: Alimbayeva et al. established a cardiovascular risk stratification model through multimodal integration of ECG biomarkers using logistic regression, random forest classifiers, and convolutional neural networks (7). While, Khurshid's group developed an ML-driven framework synergizing ECG patterns with clinical risk factors, achieving significant predictive capacity for the onset of AF (8). These developments, driven by ongoing technological advancements and the growing availability of open-access clinical data, positions AI-driven approaches as powerful tools to enhance the accuracy of AF detection and improve diagnostic efficiency.The increasing clinical adoption of HRV monitoring technologies has driven substantial research interest in AI-driven HRV feature engineering for AF prediction. However, existing studies demonstrate substantial methodological heterogeneity in algorithm architectures, data quality standards, and validation protocols, which may introduce potential biases in diagnostic performance evaluations. This study aims to fill this gap by conducting the first diagnostic test accuracy meta-analysis that simultaneously evaluates both sensitivity and specificity of ML-enhanced HRV analysis for AF detection. The findings provide essential insights to inform clinical decision-making and offer valuable guidance for future algorithmic improvements through standardized performance bench marking.2Materials and methods2.1Protocol and registrationThis meta-analysis is reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement (Supplementary Table S1) (9), and it was registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42025634406).2.2Search strategy and study selectionA systematic search was conducted across four major databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane Library, from their inception through December 13, 2024, limited to English-language publications. The search strategy is as follows: (atrial fibrillation OR auricular fibrillation) and (heart rate variability OR HRV OR SDNN OR SDANN OR RMSSD) and (artificial intelligence OR machine learning OR deep learning).Two researchers (YZW and LCX) completed the literature screening separately——title and abstract screening eliminated clearly irrelevant records (e.g., non-AI methods, non-ECG data, or animal studies)——followed by full-text evaluation of potentially eligible articles against predefined criteria. Discrepancies were resolved through consensus discussions or third-reviewer arbitration (LH).Inclusion criteria were as follows——(1) implementation of machine learning algorithms, (2) using ECG-derived data, (3) AF as the primary clinical endpoint, (4) human clinical studies, and (5) the prediction of true positive (TP), false positive (FP), false negative (FN), and true negative (TN) either be included in studies or can be calculated; Exclusion criteria included——(1) duplication publications, (2) studies involving critically ill populations, and (3) undefined AI methodologies. The complete selection process was detailed in Figure 1.Figure 1Flow diagram of literature search and study selection.Flowchart illustrating the selection process for records. Initially, 303 records were identified from databases including PubMed (89), Embase (116), Web of Science (90), and Cochrane Library (8). After removing 179 duplicates, 79 were excluded based on abstract and title for reasons such as not being related to AF risk or not using HRV. Further, 32 were removed after full-text review, primarily for similar reasons. The process resulted in 12 final inclusions.2.3Data extraction and quality assessmentTwo investigators (YZW and LCX) independently extracted data using standardized templates. The following parameters were collected: first author, publication year, data source, specifications of the AI algorithm, and diagnostic performance metrics (sensitivity, specificity). The methodological quality was assessed with the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool (10), which evaluates four critical domains: (1) patient selection, (2) index test, (3) reference standard, and (4)flow and timing. After the initial data extraction, cross-validation was conducted to verify inter-rater consistency. Due to the limited sample size (n < 20), Cohen's kappa coefficients were not calculated, as agreement measures can be statistically unstable with small sample sizes.2.4Statistical analysisWhen a patient was diagnosed as AF, it was considered a positive result; conversely, when diagnosed as non-AF, it was considered a negative result. So, TP refers to the number of true positive samples, which are correctly predicted as positive. FP indicates the number of false positive samples, which are negative but incorrectly predicted as positive. TN refers to the number of true negative samples, which are correctly predicted as negative. FN represents the number of false negative samples, which are positive but incorrectly predicted as negative. Two independent investigators (YZ and LC) extracted the number of TP, FP, FN, and TN from each eligible study. We implemented bivariate random-effects modeling coupled with hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic analysis to derive pooled sensitivity and specificity estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Heterogeneity assessment incorporated Cochran's Q and I2 statistics, with predefined thresholds: Q-test P-value ≥ 0.10 and I2 ≤ 50% indicating low heterogeneity, vs. P < 0.10 and I2 > 50% denoting substantial heterogeneity. For analyses demonstrating substantial heterogeneity, we conducted meta-regression, sensitivity analyses, leave-one-out analyses. And we conducted subgroup analysis with the type of AI algorithm and number of adopted data sets as parameters to investigate potential sources of variability.Publication bias was evaluated using Deek's funnel plot asymmetry test, with statistical significance set at P > 0.05 indicating absence of bias. Finally, we conducted a clinical diagnostic test for this diagnostic strategy, calculating both the positive likelihood ratio (PLR) and the negative likelihood ratio (NLR) to assess its diagnostic accuracy. All statistical computations were performed in Stata/MP 18.0 and R 4.4.2.3Results3.1Characteristics of included studiesThis analysis incorporated twelve diagnostic studies (11, 22), five of these studies predicted the occurrence of AF (11, 14, 16, 18, 19), and another seven used AI algorithms to detect AF (12, 13, 15, 17, 20–22). And the included studies with algorithm type distributed as follows: four studies employed DL methods (11, 12, 15, 17), seven utilized ML approaches (13, 14, 18–22), and only one study incorporated both two algorithmic ways (16). Data mainly originated from the PhysioNet platform (https://physionet.org/), MIT-BIH Atrial Fibrillation Database, and MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database. Only one investigation utilized clinical datasets (18), while another synthesized clinical and repository data (12). Regarding data diversity, only five original studies used multi-source datasets (11–13, 16, 18), other 7 studies relying on single-source one.

The evaluation results are as follows: (1) patient election (2 studies with high risk of bias, 6 with unclear risk of bias, and 4 with low risk of bias), (2) index test (all 12 studies with low risk of bias), (3) reference standard (no study with high risk of bias, 2 with unclear risk of bias, 10 with low risk of bias), and (4)flow and timing (4 studies with high risk of bias, 5 with unclear risk of bias, and 3 with low risk of bias). A detailed summary of the quality assessment results can be found in Figure 2.Figure 2Summary of risk of bias across all included studies.Risk of bias and applicability concerns table with studies from 2008 to 2024. It uses color codes: red for high, yellow for unclear, and green for low risk. Categories include patient selection, index test, reference standard, and flow and timing. Legends indicate overall risk distribution, with bar charts showing a summary of ratings for both bias and concerns.3.3Meta analysisA total of 12 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The forest plot indicated that AI exhibited high diagnostic performance in identifying AF with HRV from ECG. The pooled sensitivity was 0.94 (95% CI: 0.87–0.98), while the pooled specificity was 0.97 (95% CI: 0.92–0.99). The summary receiver operating characteristic curve showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.99 (95% CI: 0.97–0.99), with most studies demonstrating strong sensitivity and specificity (Figure 3A). In predicting the onset of AF, the AI algorithm demonstrated a sensitivity of 0.87 (95% CI: 0.74–0.94), specificity of 0.90 (95% CI: 0.72–0.97), and an AUC of 0.94 (Figure 3B). For AF detection, the AI algorithm exhibited even superior performance, with sensitivity of 0.96 (0.87–0.99), specificity of 0.99 (0.96–1.00), and AUC of 1.00 (0.99–1.00) (Figure 3C). The above three results are summarized in Table 2. However, considerable heterogeneity was observed in the forest plot, with sensitivity showing an I2 of 99.95%, Q = 24,113.88, and P < 0.1, and specificity exhibiting an I2 of 99.94%, Q = 18,584.74, and P < 0.1. To explore the sources of heterogeneity, we conducted meta-regression, sensitivity analysis, and subgroup analysis.Figure 3Forest plot and receiver operating characteristics curves of artificial intelligence for AF identification in HRV.

The results indicated that the heterogeneity between different AI algorithm types was not statistically significant (P > 0.05), and no significant differences in specificity were observed between single-dataset and multi-dataset groups (P > 0.05). Therefore, neither the AI algorithm type nor the number of datasets explained the heterogeneity observed in the meta-analysis (Supplementary Figure S2). Sensitivity analysis demonstrated the robustness of the overall results (Supplementary Figure S3). When each study was individually excluded, neither the pooled effect size nor the heterogeneity exhibited any significant changes (Supplementary Table S4).3.5Subgroup analysisSubgroup analysis revealed significant differences in diagnostic performance based on various AI algorithms type (Figure 4A). The DL model demonstrated nearly perfect discriminative ability, with an AUC of 0.99 (95% CI: 0.98–1.00), sensitivity of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.76–0.99), and specificity of 0.98 (95% CI: 0.93–1.00) (Supplementary Figure S5A). In contrast, AUC of ML models was 0.97 (95% CI: 0.96–0.98), with sensitivity of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.84–0.96) and specificity of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.84–0.99), which were slightly inferior to those of the DL model (Supplementary Figure S5B). Additionally, data diversity was found to have a crucial impact on model generalization ability (Figure 4B). When trained on a single database, AUC was 0.95 (95% CI: 0.92–0.96), with sensitivity of 0.89 (95% CI: 0.86–0.91) (Supplementary Figure S5C). However, cross-validation using multiple databases significantly improved diagnostic performance, with an AUC of 0.99 (95% CI: 0.98–1.00) and sensitivity increased to 0.96 (95% CI: 0.81–0.99) (Supplementary Figure S5D).Figure 4Summary of receiver operating characteristics.

Data points are plotted, with ellipses illustrating spread. Graph A shows clustered data near lower false positive rates, while graph B features spread towards higher rates. Both graphs include legends explaining line styles.3.6Clinical diagnostic testingWhen the PLR value exceeds 10, a positive result significantly raises the likelihood of disease, shifting the pre-test probability from 20% to 90%. In this study, PLR was 37, suggesting this diagnostic marker effectively identified the presence of the disease. Conversely, when the NLR is below 0.1, a negative result markedly reduces the probability of disease, lowering the pre-test probability from 20% to 1%. In this study, NLR was 0.06, demonstrating that this diagnostic marker is highly effective in ruling out the disease in negative cases (Figure 5).Figure 5Fagan plot.Nomogram graph depicting pre-test probability, likelihood ratio, and post-test probability. Pre-test probability is 20%, and the likelihood ratio ranges from 0.001 to 1000. The post-test probability for a positive result rises to 90% with an LR of 37, while for a negative result, it drops to 1% with an LR of 0.06.3.7Publication biasPublication bias was evaluated using Deek's funnel plot asymmetry test. The results indicated a P-value of 0.16, suggesting that no publication bias was present in the studies included in this analysis (Figure 6).Figure 6Deeks’ funnel plot.Deeks’ Funnel Plot for Asymmetry Test shows the regression line and scattered study points on a graph with axes labeled 1/root(ESS) and Diagnostic Odds Ratio. The p-value is 0.16.4DiscussionThis study is the first to evaluate the diagnostic performance of HRV based on AI algorithms through a meta-analysis. The 12 included studies demonstrate that AI models exhibit outstanding performance in identifying AF, especially in detecting AF. The area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve is the theoretical optimal value (AUC = 1.00), which seems to mean that AI could be the “gold method” for diagnosing AF. Notably, the clinical applicability analysis further validated the diagnostic value of this technology: the PLR value is 37, and the NLR value is 0.06. These findings indicated that the AI-based HRV diagnostic tool has strong accuracy and rule out negative results effectively, highlighting its potential as a auxiliary tools for clinicians in identifying AF.Our results are consistent with previous studies. For example, Manetas-Stavrakakis et al. conducted a cohort or case-control study using single-lead ECG to detect AF and reported a combined sensitivity of 92.3% and specificity of 96.2% (23). In comparison, our study found even higher sensitivity and specificity, suggesting that HRV may be a more accurate AF diagnostic marker. Subsequent subgroup analyses revealed that, compared to ML models, DL demonstrated superior diagnostic performance, which aligns with the findings of Solam Lee et al (24). Additionally, Xie C.G. et al. reached similar conclusions, with the DL model exhibiting significantly higher sensitivity (98.1%) compared to the ML model (91.5%) (25). DL models represent an important category of ML, encompassing algorithms such as deep feedforward neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and deep belief networks. A key feature of these models is their high degree of flexibility. Unlike ML models, the individual representations in DL are not manually designed by researchers but are instead learned from training data (26). Furthermore, DL models learn representations not in a single step, but across multiple layers between hidden layers. More importantly, the subsequent transformations between layers in DL models are non-linear, significantly enhancing the model's adaptability. This could explain the superior performance of the DL model observed in our study.Although this study demonstrates promising combined results, several limitations are unavoidable. On the one hand, limitations stems from the included studies themselves. The majority of studies did not use external validation sets, and the widespread use of a single data source led to significant overlap between model training and validation sets. This overlap may hinder the model's ability to adapt to the complexity of real-world patients and clinical environments, potentially increasing misdiagnosis rates and medical risks. The AUC in detecting atrial fibrillation may imply an overlap between the training sets and test sets, and the lack of real-world external validation may be an important reason why the AUC is perfect. On the other hand, there was considerable heterogeneity observed across studies (sensitivity I2 = 99.95%, specificity I2 = 99.94%). Although meta-regression and sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of our findings, this suggested the presence of deeper underlying factors. One major cause of heterogeneity is the differences in the source and quality of the raw data. The majority of the included studies relied on the publicly available PhysioNet database, with only one study collecting clinical data and one combining both clinical and database data. While the standardized collection process of public databases reduces technical bias, it may not fully reflect the complexity of real-world clinical scenarios. Clinical data collection, is often susceptible to background noise (e.g., patients’ movement). Unfortunately, due to the limited number of clinical diagnostic studies, we were unable to perform subgroup analysis to compare the diagnostic performance of database vs. clinical data. Secondly, while all studies focused on HRV as the central feature, there were slight differences in the ECG features of HRV, leading to a lack of a standard procedures for HRV extraction. For example, Chen W. et al. used the RR interval as the HRV feature (11), while Bus S. et al. extracted the pRRx parameter to predict AF (22). Other studies incorporated multiple indicators as HRV features, including DNN, RMSSD, pNN50, and pNN20 (15, 18, 19). These technical variations led to inconsistent model inputs, affecting performance stability. Finally, since ECG signals are highly susceptible to various types of interference during data collection, background noise can obscure the true cardiac electrical activity, thereby affecting the performance and accuracy of AI models. Consequently, most diagnostic studies performed denoising prior to HRV signal input. Removing noise helps preserve crucial ECG signals (27), thereby reducing the rates of both false positives and false negatives. However, subtle AF fibrillation waves could be mistakenly classified as noise and eliminated, resulting in diagnostic bias. Additionally, there are significant differences in signal fidelity and computational efficiency among different denoising methods, which contributes to the substantial heterogeneity observed in this study.The limitations of this study reflect common challenges in the current field. There is a clear need for standardized data collection processes and high-quality datasets to ensure consistency in data input. Additionally, it is crucial to identify and optimize the most effective HRV features to enhance the specificity of AF identification. More importantly, there is an urgent need for additional prospective studies to assess the real-world applicability of AI prediction models. Despite these challenges, the accuracy of AI models for identifying arrhythmias has already been shown to surpass that of general cardiologists (28). We look forward to the development of more comprehensive databases and more advanced AI algorithms, which can assist clinicians in better diagnosing atrial fibrillation.5ConclusionIn conclusion, AI effectively utilizes HRV in ECG signals to detect AF, with its DL algorithms and multi-database approaches demonstrating superior diagnostic performance."}
{"PMCID": "12173554", "title": "A Meta-Analysis of the Incidence of Adverse Reactions of Statins in Various Diseases", "abstract": "Introduction: In clinical practice, patients often avoid or cease statin use due to adverse reactions or noncompliance. To elucidate statin adverse reactions, their variability across diseases, and the factors influencing them, we conducted a high-quality clinical trial–based meta-analysis.\nMaterials and Methods: Clinical randomized controlled trials involving statins and detailed recording of adverse reactions in the following three databases: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library were included. The retrieval was completed by January 31, 2024. All studies will use the ROB2 scale for bias risk assessment.\nResults: We had included a total of 41 studies, involving a collective sample size of 64,728 individuals. In patients with hyperlipidemia, there was no difference in the overall incidence of total adverse events among four types of statins (p = 0.37). Simvastatin 40 mg had fewer statin-related adverse reactions. High-dose statin users experienced no remarkable transaminase elevation 0.00201 (95% CI [0.00004, 0.00398], I2 = 33%). Creatine phosphokinase (CK) elevation under three times the upper limit was rare with a rate of 0.0043 (95% CI [0.0011, 0.0075], I2 = 27%). Myalgia rates were comparable between high- and moderate-dose statins (p = 0.23). Gastrointestinal symptoms were infrequent with a rate of about 0.02 (95% CI [0.00, 0.01], I2 = 52%). For patients with coronary heart disease, pravastatin 40 mg resulted in fewer transaminase elevations (p < 0.01). There is no difference in myalgia rates between moderate- and high-dose statins (p = 0.78). The proportion of myopathy was higher with simvastatin 80 mg compared to other statins. The risk of rhabdomyolysis was dose-dependent (p < 0.01). For heart failure patients, elderly patients showed varying risks of CK elevation, gastrointestinal symptoms, and muscle symptoms (I2 = 71%, 99%, and 99%, respectively). For patients with acute coronary syndrome or acute stroke, the rates of transaminase elevation were higher with simvastatin 40 mg and atorvastatin 80 mg compared to other statins (p < 0.01). There is no difference in myalgia rates between rosuvastatin 20 mg and atorvastatin 80 mg (p = 0.20). However, the rate of myalgia with atorvastatin 80 mg was higher than that of rosuvastatin 10 mg and atorvastatin 20 mg (p < 0.01). For diabetic patients, there was no difference in the effect on transaminases among four statin medications: rosuvastatin 10 and 40 mg, simvastatin 40 mg, and atorvastatin 80 mg (0.00058, 95% CI [0.00000, 0.00464], I2 = 0%). Additionally, there was no difference in the rates of myalgia among atorvastatin 10, 40, and 80 mg and rosuvastatin 20 and 40 mg (p = 0.05).\nConclusion: Statins' adverse reactions differ across populations. For those with hypercholesterolemia and diabetes, statins' impact on transaminase levels is similar. Yet patients with coronary heart disease, acute coronary syndrome, or acute stroke show varying responses. Notably, myalgia risk in hypercholesterolemia and coronary disease patients using different statins is comparable, but those with acute coronary syndrome or stroke, especially on high-dose rosuvastatin, have a higher myalgia risk.", "body": "1. IntroductionFrom 1990 to 2022, global cardiovascular disease mortality dropped by 34.9%. Despite this progress, ischemic heart disease continues to lead in global disability rates at 2275.9 per 100,000, followed closely by cerebral hemorrhage and ischemic stroke. The prevalence of age-standardized cardiovascular diseases varies significantly by region, ranging from 5881.0 per 10,000 in South Asia to 11,342.6 per 10,000 in Central Asia [1].A key contributor to the burden of cardiovascular disease is abnormal blood lipids, particularly high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Elevated LDL-C accumulates in arterial walls, activating endothelial cells and triggering monocyte attraction into the subendothelial space. This recruitment promotes macrophage activation and inflammation within the intima, leading to atherosclerotic lesion formation, which can result in ischemic heart disease, ischemic stroke, and other manifestations of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) [2].Between 1980 and 2018, global age-standardized levels of nonhigh-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) notably increased. In men, levels rose from 2.82 to 3.04 mmol/L, while in women, they increased from 2.83 to 3.08 mmol/L. Specifically, in China, age-standardized non-HDL-C levels for men jumped by 0.61 mmol/L, positioning them at 99th globally and surpassing those of several Western countries [3]. As such, managing dyslipidemia and reducing non-HDL-C levels remain crucial strategies in combating cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.Statins have been a cornerstone in the treatment of high LDL-C, functioning by inhibiting hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase. These medications can significantly lower LDL cholesterol by 20%–50%, reduce triglyceride levels by 10%–20%, and may slightly increase HDL cholesterol levels [4]. Statins, a treatment modality for nearly 40 years, have proven to be effective and safe. However, some patients may exhibit higher risks of adverse effects, such as myopathy and rhabdomyolysis, particularly with cerivastatin. Thus, balancing efficacy and risk is crucial for protecting patient health [5].In an examination of adverse event reports (AERs) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), it was found that pravastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin, and rosuvastatin had high incidences of myalgia, rhabdomyolysis, and elevated creatine phosphokinase levels. Notably, rosuvastatin was particularly linked to myalgia, while simvastatin and rosuvastatin showed stronger associations with rhabdomyolysis and increases in creatine phosphokinase [6].To better understand the real-world implications of statin therapy, a meta-analysis was conducted to assess how the side effects of statins vary across different diseases and to gauge the frequency of various reactions. This information can serve as a valuable resource for physicians in making informed clinical decisions.2. Materials and MethodsThis systematic review was conducted in adherence to the PRISMA guidelines and documented using the PRISMA checklist [7]. The study has been prospectively registered in PROSPERO under the registration number CRD42024553987. Given its nature as a meta-analysis, it was exempt from obtaining approval from an institutional review board and patient consent.2.1. Literature SelectionWe conducted a comprehensive search for clinical randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving statin medications, with detailed documentation of adverse reactions, in the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases until January 31, 2024. The search terms utilized for this study included keywords related to statins (“statin,” “rosuvastatin,” “atorvastatin,” “pitavastatin,” “lovastatin,” “fluvastatin,” “pravastatin,” and “simvastatin”), randomized clinical trials (“clinical trial,” “clinical study,” and “randomized clinical trial”), and adverse reactions (“side effects,” “adverse effects,” “adverse reactions,” “adverse events,” and “adverse drug reactions”). The complete search strategies for each individual database can be found in Supporting Information 1: Text S1.2.2. Selection CriteriaStudies were included if they met the following inclusion criteria: (1) RCTs, (2) statin comparisons (vs. placebos and other drugs), (3) detailed patient information, (4) clear statin names/doses, (5) follow-up period of at least 1 month, and (6) > 30 participants per group. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) unclear reaction details, (2) combined statin types/doses without separate analysis, and (3) missing criteria like elevated transaminase or creatine kinase levels.2.3. Data Extraction and Risks of Bias AssessmentThree researchers (LWY, WD, and LCY) independently filtered and reviewed retrieved trials, resolving disagreements. Two researchers (LWY and WD) then independently extracted data on authors, publication year, location, population, sample size, demographics, medical history, medications, intervention (statin type, dose, and duration), and adverse reactions. Discrepancies were checked by additional authors.The biased risk assessment used the Cochrane Collaboration's RoB2 tool, featuring five domains: randomization, intervention adherence, outcome measurement, and result reporting. Judgments were “low,” “some concerns,” or “high” at the domain level, with an overall judgment based on criteria [8]. Moreover, it employs a macroenabled Excel file, released by the revised version of RoB2 on August 22, 2019, as an assessment tool [9]. If any discrepancies arise during the data extraction or assessment process, a third researcher would propose potential solutions.2.4. Effect MeasureOutcome measures include the following: total adverse events, adverse drug-related reactions, alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/aspartate aminotransferase increase, blood creatine phosphokinase increase, myalgia, myopathy, muscle complaints, rhabdomyolysis, and gastrointestinal disorders. Total adverse events are defined as any harmful or unexpected symptoms or abnormal laboratory indicators, whether or not they are drug related. Adverse drug-related reactions are defined as adverse reactions associated with the drug. The numerical reference standards for ALT, AST, and CK are the upper limit of normal (ULN). They are classified based on values greater than 3 × ULN, 5 × ULN, or 10 × ULN. Symptoms self-reported by subjects during the trial, such as muscle pain, muscle weakness, and muscle stiffness, are classified using the “Regulatory Activities Medical Dictionary” (MedDRA) [10]. The ratio of the number of individuals in the experimental group experiencing various adverse reactions to the total number of individuals in the experimental group is used as the outcome measure.2.5. Statistical AnalysisFirst, study data was grouped by main diagnoses; then, data for similar adverse reactions were combined.Using R (4.3.1), a meta-analysis was conducted on adverse reaction proportions relative to the experimental group's participants. Before this, normality tests were performed on original and converted rates, selecting the most normalizing method. Combined estimates, including 95% confidence intervals, were given. The “incr” value (0.5) replaced zero event occurrences and was used across all studies. For heterogeneity, Cochran's Q test and I2 statistics were applied, with p > 0.05 indicating no heterogeneity, 25%–50% low, 50%–75% moderate, and > 75% high heterogeneity [11]. For heterogeneity assessment, a “leave-one-out” analysis was performed on the studies (Supporting Information 2: Figure S1, Supporting Information 3: Figure S2, Supporting Information 4: Figure S3, Supporting Information 5: Figure S4, Supporting Information 6: Figure S5, Supporting Information 7: Figure S6, Supporting Information 8: Figure S7, Supporting Information 9: Figure S8, Supporting Information 10: Figure S9, Supporting Information 11: Figure S10, Supporting Information 12: Figure S11, Supporting Information 13: Figure S12, Supporting Information 14: Figure S13, and Supporting Information 15: Figure S14). Then, a random effects model was applied to examine the effect of baseline covariates on heterogeneity. For I2 > 50%, subgroup analysis was conducted, including types and doses of statin drugs as covariates, with a forest plot generated (details in Supporting Information). A network meta-analysis was performed in Stata (Version 17.0) to compare results with significant heterogeneity. Using the frequency network analysis method, an optimal ranking probability graph was created, and the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) was used to evaluate the adverse reaction probabilities for various treatments.3. Results3.1. Eligible Studies and the Risks of Bias AssessmentUsing a set search strategy, we scanned three databases and found 3418 studies. Duplicate entries were removed in EndNote software, and additional duplicates were eliminated by reviewing titles. Abstracts were then screened to exclude less relevant articles, and full texts were read to identify studies that met our inclusion and exclusion criteria. Ultimately, 41 studies involving 64,728 subjects were included [12–52]. The PRISMA flowchart depicting the acquisition process is presented in Figure 1. Among the 41 studies included, 19 targeted patients with hyperlipidemia, 8 focused on patients with coronary heart disease, 6 focused on patients with acute coronary syndrome or acute ischemic stroke, 2 focused on patients with chronic heart failure, and 6 focused on patients with diabetes. These studies encompassed six different types of statins at various dosages (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, fluvastatin, pitavastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin). Baseline characteristics of the included studies are displayed in Table 1.All trials mentioned random allocation of participants as a means to mitigate bias risk. Specifically, 21 studies stated the methods used for generating random sequences [12, 13, 15, 17, 19–24, 30–32, 35–37, 39–42, 49], while three trials described allocation concealment [12, 22, 31]. The remaining studies did not provide detailed information on this aspect. Double-blind methods were employed in 28 studies [12–14, 17–20, 22–24, 27, 28, 30, 34–36, 38–41, 43–46, 49–52], and two studies mentioned outcome concealment [19, 21]. All studies correctly reported reasons for participant attrition and provided baseline data to assess comparability between groups.  Figure 2 provides a summary of the assessment of bias risk.3.2. Meta-Analysis of the Prevalence of Adverse Reactions to Statins in Various DiseasesDue to the significant differences in adverse reactions among different disease populations and the varying emphasis on recording adverse reactions, the subjects were divided into five major groups: hyperlipidemia patients, coronary heart disease patients, acute coronary syndrome or acute ischemic stroke patients, heart failure patients, and diabetes mellitus patients for subgroup analysis. Additionally, according to the 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines, statins were categorized into high-, moderate-, and low-dose groups for subgroup analysis [53].3.2.1. The Adverse Reactions of Statins in Hyperlipidemia PatientsThe six indicators with the highest reported frequency in safety evaluation for hyperlipidemia patients were as follows: total adverse events, adverse drug-related events, elevated ALT/aspartate aminotransferase level, elevated blood creatine phosphokinase level, myalgia, and gastrointestinal disorders.3.2.1.1. The Total Adverse Event Rate of Statins in Hyperlipidemia PatientsIn hyperlipidemia patients taking statins, a total adverse event rate of about 0.29 (95% CI [0.25, 0.32], p < 0.01) was observed, with high heterogeneity (I2 = 95%) (Figure 3a). Postsubgroup analysis, no difference was found in total adverse event rates among pitavastatin (2 and 4 mg), atorvastatin (10, 20, 40, and 80 mg), rosuvastatin (10 and 20 mg), and simvastatin (20, 40, and 80 mg) (Figure 3b).3.2.1.2. Adverse Drug-Related Event Rate of Statins in Hyperlipidemia PatientsHyperlipidemia patients had an adverse event rate of roughly 0.08 (95% CI [0.06, 0.09]), with high heterogeneity (I2 = 87%) (Figure 4a). Subgroup analysis indicated varied adverse event rates across statin types and dosages (p < 0.01) (Figure 4b). A network meta-analysis was conducted on studies that included two or more statin drugs (Figure 4c). The cumulative ranking curve shows that simvastatin 40 mg ranks best in terms of adverse drug-related events (Figure 4d). A consistency model was used for network meta-analysis, forming pairwise comparisons among 10 drug regimens, resulting in 45 comparisons. Among these, four comparisons showed statistical significance. These were the risk differences (RDs) in drug-related adverse reactions between simvastatin 40 mg and pitavastatin 4 mg, simvastatin 20 mg, pitavastatin 2 mg, and atorvastatin 80 mg, respectively.3.2.1.3. The Rate of Transaminase Elevation in Hyperlipidemia Patients Caused by StatinsIn hyperlipidemia patients, transaminase elevation data did not adhere to normal distribution. Upon categorizing into high-dose and nonhigh-dose groups and statistical testing, only the high-dose group exhibited normal distribution. Meta-analysis on this group (rosuvastatin 20 mg, atorvastatin 40 and 80 mg, and simvastatin 80 mg) showed low transaminase elevation events (0.00201, 95% CI [0.00004, 0.00398]). Studies demonstrated low heterogeneity (I2 = 33%) (Figure 5).3.2.1.4. The Rate of Blood Creatine Phosphokinase Elevation in Hyperlipidemia Patients Caused by StatinsAbout 0.43% (95% CI [0.0011, 0.0075]) of hyperlipidemia patients showed CK elevation, not exceeding three times the upper limit, with low study heterogeneity (I2 = 27%) (Figure 6). For CK elevation exceeding 5 and 10 times the upper limit, a normal distribution could not be assumed, hindering meta-analysis.3.2.1.5. The Rate of Myalgia in Hyperlipidemia Patients Caused by StatinsThe incidence of statin-induced myalgia is about 0.01 (95% CI [0.01, 0.01]), showing moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 61%) (Figure 7a). Analysis found no difference in myalgia rates between moderate and high statin doses (p = 0.54) nor among various statin types and dosages (p = 0.23) (Figure 7b).3.2.1.6. The Rate of Gastrointestinal Disorders in Hyperlipidemia Patients Caused by StatinsThe proportion of hyperlipidemia patients experiencing gastrointestinal disorders was approximately 0.02 (95% CI [0.00, 0.03]), with moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 52%) (Figure 8).3.2.2. The Adverse Reactions of Statins in Coronary Heart Disease PatientsThe four indicators with the highest reported frequency in safety evaluation for coronary heart disease patients were as follows: elevated ALT/aspartate aminotransferase, myalgia, rhabdomyolysis, and myopathy.3.2.2.1. The Rate of Transaminase Elevation in Coronary Heart Disease Patients Caused by StatinsRemarkable variation was observed in the proportion of coronary heart disease patients with transaminase levels over three times the upper limit value (I2 = 92%, Figure 9a). Subgroup analysis revealed that different statin types and dosages led to varying outcomes (p < 0.01), with pravastatin showing lower transaminase elevation rates (Figure 9b). Notably, the pravastatin 40 mg group had a remarkably lower transaminase elevation rate compared to pitavastatin and simvastatin 80 mg, as well as atorvastatin 80 mg and simvastatin 20 mg (p < 0.01 and p = 0.04, respectively). However, difference was not found between the pitavastatin and simvastatin 80 mg and atorvastatin 80 mg and simvastatin 20 mg groups (p = 0.16) (Figure 9c).3.2.2.2. The Rate of Myalgia in Coronary Heart Disease Patients Caused by StatinsThe rate of myalgia in coronary heart disease patients shows a remarkable variability across studies (I2 = 76%, Figure 10a), but subgroup analysis did not find differences in myalgia probability between moderate- and high-dose groups (p = 0.89) or among various statin types and dosages (p = 0.78) (Figure 10b).3.2.2.3. The Rate of Myopathy in Coronary Heart Disease Patients Caused by StatinsThe rate of myopathy in coronary heart disease patients varies remarkably (I2 = 92%, Figure 11a), with subgroup analysis indicating that simvastatin 80 mg notably increases myopathy risk compared to other groups (p < 0.01) (Figure 11b).3.2.2.4. The Rate of Rhabdomyolysis in Coronary Heart Disease Patients Caused by StatinsThe data on rhabdomyolysis in coronary heart disease patients showed a remarkable heterogeneity (I2 = 70%, Figure 12a). Subgroup analysis revealed that the rhabdomyolysis incidence correlated with dosage, with clear differences noted between low-, moderate-, and high-dose groups (p < 0.01); the rates of rhabdomyolysis for the low-, moderate-, and high-dose groups were 0.00016 (95% CI [0.0000, 0.00087]), 0.00007 (95% CI [0.0000, 0.0005]), and 0.00123 (95% CI [0.00052, 0.00223]), respectively, and no difference within the moderate- and high-dose subgroups (p = 0.13 and p = 0.57) (Figure 12b).3.2.3. The Adverse Reactions of Statins in Heart Failure PatientsTwo studies on heart failure patients treated with 10 mg rosuvastatin noted safety issues like aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase, elevated blood creatine phosphokinase, myalgia, and gastrointestinal disorders. Only transaminase elevation over three times the normal value showed no study-to-study variation (I2 = 0%, Figure 13a). However, heterogeneity was remarkable for CK exceeding 10 times the ULN value, myalgia, and gastrointestinal disorders (I2 = 71%, 99%, and 99%, respectively, Figures 13b, 13c, and 13d).3.2.4. The Adverse Reactions of Statins in Acute Coronary Syndrome or Acute Stroke PatientsIn studies involving patients with acute coronary syndrome or acute stroke, the safety evaluation mentioned two frequently observed indicators: elevated transaminases and myalgia.3.2.4.1. The Rate of Transaminase Elevation in Acute Coronary Syndrome or Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients Caused by StatinsRemarkable heterogeneity (I2 = 92%) was observed in the transaminase elevation exceeding three times the ULN (Figure 14a). Subgroup analysis revealed similar transaminase elevation rates between 40 mg simvastatin and 80 mg atorvastatin (Figure 14b). Consequently, data from these two groups were combined for effect size estimation, compared with others, showing higher transaminase elevation rates for simvastatin 40 mg and atorvastatin 80 mg compared to 10 and 20 mg rosuvastatin, 20 mg atorvastatin, and 40 mg pravastatin (p < 0.01). There was no statistically difference within these two groups (p = 0.69 and p = 0.91) (Figure 14c).3.2.4.2. The Rate of Myalgia in Acute Coronary Syndrome or Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients Caused by StatinsStatins' myalgia occurrence varies greatly across studies (I2 = 96%, Figure 15a). Subgroup analysis indicates that the 20 mg rosuvastatin and 80 mg atorvastatin doses increase myalgia risk compared to 10 mg rosuvastatin and 20 mg atorvastatin (Figure 15b). Combining 10 mg rosuvastatin and 20 mg atorvastatin data for analysis showed no difference in the myalgia rate between 20 mg rosuvastatin and 80 mg atorvastatin (p = 0.20). Notably, the 80 mg atorvastatin dose resulted in a higher myalgia rate than both 10 mg rosuvastatin and 20 mg atorvastatin (p < 0.01, Figure 15c).3.2.5. The Adverse Reactions of Statins in Diabetes Mellitus PatientsIn studies involving patients with diabetes mellitus, the safety evaluation mentioned two frequently observed indicators: elevated transaminases and myalgia.3.2.5.1. The Rate of Transaminase Elevation in Diabetes Mellitus Patients Caused by StatinsThe proportion of diabetic patients experiencing transaminase elevation over three times the upper normal limit was rare (0.00058, 95% CI [0.00000, 0.00464]), showing no study heterogeneity (I2 = 0%) (Figure 16).3.2.5.2. The Rate of Myalgia in Diabetes Mellitus Patients Caused by StatinsAnalysis of studies in diabetic patients showed high heterogeneity for myalgia occurrence (I2 = 96%, Figure 17a). Subgroup analysis indicated that 40 mg rosuvastatin had a higher myalgia rate than others, while 20 mg simvastatin had a lower rate (Figure 17b). In order to clarify whether the difference was caused by rosuvastatin 40 mg or simvastatin 20 mg, comparisons were made between rosuvastatin 40 mg and simvastatin 20 mg with the other groups, respectively. Comparisons revealed no difference in the myalgia rate between 40 mg rosuvastatin and atorvastatin 10, 40, and 80 mg, or rosuvastatin 20 mg (p = 0.05). In contrast, 20 mg simvastatin had different myalgia rates compared to the aforementioned groups (p < 0.01), with no variation in the atorvastatin 10, 40, and 80 mg and rosuvastatin 20 mg groups (p = 0.42) (Figure 17c).4. DiscussionPast studies mainly examined specific adverse effects of statin treatment on individual diseases. A gap exists for a broader analysis encompassing various adverse effects from using different statins at various doses across multiple diseases. To investigate if the risk of experiencing adverse effects varies among patients with diverse diseases on statins, we performed a thorough review of clinical trials on statin-induced side effects, enrolling 64,728 participants.In our hyperlipidemia study, we found that moderate and high doses of statins resulted in similar rates of total adverse effects, such as myalgia, elevated transaminases, blood creatine phosphokinase, and gastrointestinal issues. Network meta-analysis showed that simvastatin 40 mg had the lowest rate of drug-related adverse reactions compared to pitavastatin 4 and 2 mg, as well as atorvastatin 80 mg. This suggests that high-dose statins may lead to fewer adverse reactions in patients with limited comorbidities. This conclusion was reinforced by a study on healthy individuals, which demonstrated that 6 months of 80 mg atorvastatin did not reduce average muscle strength or exercise performance [54]. Moreover, it has been found that the use of high doses of statins in patients with hyperlipidemia does not lead to a significant increase in transaminases, indicating the safety of statins for the liver. This conclusion was supported by a clinical study conducted in 2012 aimed at assessing the safety and efficacy of atorvastatin and pitavastatin in patients with mild to moderate elevations in liver enzymes. In this study, 135 patients with hypercholesterolemia, whose serum ALT levels were elevated to 1.25–2.5 times the ULN (without alcoholic or viral hepatitis), continued to use statins. After a 12-week observation period, their transaminase levels did not continue to rise and even showed a decrease [55]. This is because statins can alter cell regulation processes by activating peroxisome proliferator–activated receptors, inhibiting fatty acid beta-oxidation, reducing inflammatory mediators, and blocking the sonic hedgehog pathway, thereby inducing the resolution of inflammation and fat deposition in the liver [56].The incidence of transaminase elevation varies, but 40 mg pravastatin shows the lowest rate compared to other statins in patients with coronary heart disease. For myopathy, 80 mg simvastatin has a notably higher rate than other doses. Myalgia and rhabdomyolysis occurrence is similar between moderate and high doses of statins. However, 80 mg simvastatin has a higher incidence of muscle damage, leading to its US FDA restriction in June 2011 [57]. A genome-wide association study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2008 which used 40 and 80 mg of simvastatin found a strong link between myopathy and the rs4363657 SNP in the SLCO1B1 gene on Chromosome 12 [58]. Nevertheless, a genome-wide association study conducted in 2013 with rosuvastatin found no increased risk of myalgia in its users carrying the rs4363657C or rs4149056C alleles in the SLCO1B1 gene [59]. Whether there are differences in the interaction between different statins and allele genes on chromosomes requires further investigation.Two studies on heart failure patients treated with 10 mg rosuvastatin showed no difference in elevated transaminases, but the elderly group had higher rates of CK levels exceeding 10 times the ULN, muscle symptoms, and gastrointestinal issues. This suggests that advanced age and comorbidities increase adverse reactions to statins. Pharmacokinetic studies confirmed that rosuvastatin boosts endothelial nitric oxide (NO) production, alleviates myocardial damage, and improves variability (HRV) and blood pressure variability (BPV) by reducing caveolin-1 expression and enhancing apolipoprotein (apo) E-/- and NO synthase (NOS) function [60, 61]. The JUPITER trial prospectively assessed rosuvastatin 20 mg's efficacy, revealing its capability to reduce cardiovascular events in healthy individuals [62]. Rosuvastatin faced scrutiny, with a public petition on March 4, 2004, seeking its removal from the US market [63]. In the same year, The Lancet pointed out that 80 mg rosuvastatin showed severe myopathy and rhabdomyolysis in clinical trials [64]. Approval for rosuvastatin's 80 mg dose was put on hold pending the conclusion of the multinational safety assessment program [65]. Following the controversy, 80 mg rosuvastatin was scarcely used in clinical trials. Limited reports exist on its adverse effects. Considering rosuvastatin's pharmacokinetic profile and our study results, it is safe for elderly cardiac patients, with minimal liver impact, at moderate doses.Statin type and dosage notably affect two adverse reactions in patients with acute coronary syndrome or acute ischemic stroke: elevated transaminases and myalgia. Higher doses of simvastatin and atorvastatin show a higher risk of transaminase elevation compared to lower doses of rosuvastatin and pravastatin. Also, high-dose statins have a higher likelihood of causing myalgia. In long-term studies, the rate of persistent transaminase elevation with atorvastatin 80 mg or simvastatin exceeds that in other groups [66]. A large-scale data meta-analysis study published in The Lancet in 2022 found high-intensity statin treatments (40–80 mg atorvastatin and 20–40 mg rosuvastatin daily) had a higher relative risk for muscle symptoms compared to low or moderate intensity regimens [67]. Therefore, for patients with acute coronary syndrome or acute ischemic stroke needing high-intensity statins, 80 mg atorvastatin or simvastatin should be used cautiously in those with impaired hepatic function.In diabetes patients, statin use showed no variation in transaminase elevation. High-dose statins (40 mg atorvastatin, 80 mg atorvastatin, 20 mg rosuvastatin, and 40 mg rosuvastatin) and 20 mg simvastatin had similar myalgia rates. High-dose atorvastatin and rosuvastatin offer efficacy with minimized muscle side effects, aligning with other studies showing comparable myopathy and rhabdomyolysis incidence with 80 mg atorvastatin to lower doses [65]. However, in September 2013, the FDA advised reducing the maximum daily atorvastatin dose to 40 mg, down from 80 mg, following a reassessment of clinical data that highlighted an elevated risk of myopathy with higher doses.The effects of statins on the liver are generally similar; however, in patients with coronary heart disease, it has been observed that pravastatin has a lower rate of causing transaminase elevations compared to other statins. This may be attributed to pravastatin's effective transport and elimination through transport proteins associated with hepatic uptake and biliary excretion, along with its specific distribution in the liver. Furthermore, statins that are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system are susceptible to metabolism-mediated drug–drug interactions. Pravastatin undergoes very little metabolism by P450 and, therefore, is not prone to drug–drug interactions involving metabolism [68]. This also explains the lack of significant impact on transaminase levels in elderly patients treated with rosuvastatin, which shares a similar mechanism of action to pravastatin under equivalent dosing conditions.In contrast, simvastatin and atorvastatin, which rely on the cytochrome P450 system for metabolism, show relatively fewer adverse drug reactions in hyperlipidemic patients with fewer comorbidities. However, in patients with multiple comorbidities (and therefore more medications) such as those with acute coronary syndrome or acute ischemic stroke, caution should be exercised when using simvastatin or high-dose atorvastatin (80 mg) due to impaired liver metabolism. This precaution may arise from the fact that simvastatin, being a lipophilic statin in its lactone form, easily crosses cellular membranes for intestinal absorption. It is also a high-affinity substrate for CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which, in combination with other drugs, may lead to detoxification in the intestine, resulting in lower bioavailability. Additionally, the inhibition of CYP3A4 and/or P-gp may increase absorption and lead to drug interactions [68].5. ConclusionStatins' side effects differ across patient groups. For those with hypercholesterolemia and diabetes, various statins have a similar impact on transaminase levels. However, patients with coronary heart disease, acute coronary syndrome, or stroke see differing effects. Notably, myalgia risk in hypercholesterolemia patients taking different statins aligns. Yet, in those with acute coronary syndrome or stroke, high-dose statin users face a higher myalgia risk compared to those on moderate or low doses."}

Its extraintestinal manifestations may affect multiple systems and significantly impact the quality of life of the patient [1]. Epidemiological data reveal a rapid rise in the incidence and prevalence of IBD worldwide, particularly in Eastern Asia [2]. Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common arrhythmia in clinical practice, has an estimated global prevalence of 50 million in 2020 [3], underscoring its significant public health impact. Several studies have shown that AF increases mortality, mean length of stay, mean total cost, and incidence of complications such as mechanical ventilation, sepsis, and acute respiratory failure in IBD hospitalized populations, suggesting a poor prognosis for IBD complicated by AF [4]. Therefore, the prevention and treatment of AF complications in IBD patients is crucial to improve prognosis of these patients.Current studies have found that chronic inflammation inherent in IBD plays a role in the pathogenesis of AF [5], [6], [7], suggesting a potential epidemiological link between the two diseases. However, existing studies on the association between IBD and AF are limited. Therefore, our study conducted a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis, expanding the scope of existing literature, to assess the links between IBD and AF prevalence and incidence.2MethodsThis review was conducted using standard methods in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [8].2.1Search strategyWe conducted a systematic search of the PubMed and Embase databases for articles published from their inception until February 2024. The MeSH terms 'atrial fibrillation' and 'inflammatory bowel disease' and its related keywords were used in the search strategies. In addition, we screened the reference lists of included studies for additional studies that met the inclusion criteria. The search strategies are shown in Supplementary Table 1.2.2Inclusion and exclusion criteriaWe included studies that fulfilled the following criteria: i) Population: individuals with a diagnosis of IBD, encompassing either Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC). ii) Studies reporting on the prevalence or incidence rates of AF. The prevalence of AF was ascertained as the proportion of confirmed AF cases within the IBD patient cohort during the study's period. The incidence of AF was measured as the rate at which patients initially free from AF developed the AF condition over a defined time frame. iii) Study design: observational studies such as cross-sectional, case-control, and cohort studies, were considered eligible. We excluded case reports, review articles, editorials, letters, and case series that included five or fewer patients.2.3Study selection and data extractionTwo researches independently checked the titles and abstracts of retrieved records from the electronic databases. The duplicated studies were deleted, and studies that did not meet the inclusion criteria were also excluded. For the potentially relevant studies, we screened their full texts and selected the final included studies according to the predefined inclusion criteria. Disagreements were resolved through mutual discussion or consultation with senior researchers.All data were extracted by two researchers. We extracted publication details such as study authors and years, country, enrollment period, study design type, follow-up duration, and details such as sample size, age, gender (female percentage), body mass index, number of AF cases, prevalent comorbidities (e.g., hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism, dyslipidemia, obesity, smoking, cerebrovascular accident, heart failure) and effect estimates in the IBD and control groups.2.4Quality assessmentThe quality of observational studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) tool, which was assessed based on 3 factors: method of subject selection, comparability of study groups, and outcomes of interest. An NOS of ≥6 points was considered moderate-to-high quality, otherwise low quality [9].2.5Statistical analysisStatistical heterogeneity across the included studies was assessed using the I2 statistic, where an I2 value exceeding 50 % indicated substantial heterogeneity. For the prevalence analysis, we extracted the total sample size and the number of AF cases within the IBD population, which allowed us to calculate the prevalence estimates. In the incidence analysis, we identified the total number of individuals and the number of new AF cases in the IBD population to determine the incidence rates. Additionally, we extracted adjusted effect estimates, specifically the risk ratios (RRs) with its corresponding 95 % confidence intervals (CIs), from both the IBD patients and the general population. These data were pooled using the random-effects model.The subgroup analyses were conducted for the CD and UC subgroups. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the influence of each individual study on the overall results, employing a one-study-removed approach. The potential for publication bias was evaluated using Egger's test. All statistical analyses were conducted using Stata (version 16.1).3ResultsOur initial search identified 767 records, including 92 from PubMed and 675 from Embase. Among them, 84 citations were duplicates, and 621 articles were excluded based on title and abstract screening. During the full-text check, additional 37 articles were eliminated due to inappropriate article type (n = 11) and unavailability of data (n = 26). Finally, a total of 25 studies were included in this meta-analysis [4], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33]. Five of these studies were used to analyze the incidence of AF in IBD, whereas 20 were used to analyze the prevalence of AF in IBD. The results of our search are detailed in the PRISMA flowchart (Fig. 1).Fig. 1PRISMA Flowchart Depicting the Study Selection Process for This Meta-Analysis.3.1Baseline characteristics of patientsThe baseline characteristics of the 25 studies that met the inclusion criteria are shown in Table 1. All studies were observational, with 4 prospective studies and 21 retrospective studies. The studies, published between 2009 and 2023, encompassed 18 from North America, 4 from Europe, and 3 from Asia. The meta-analysis included a total of 9,433,573 IBD patients and 759,267 matched controls, with an average age ranging from 30.4 to 56.4 years old and a female proportion varying from 29.7 % to 63.4 %. Eleven studies differentiated between CD and UC, with a total of 3,387,945 patients having CD and 2,232,689 patients having UC. Follow-up ranged from one year to 12.8 years.

The incidence analysis encompassed 155,138 patients across 4 studies [29], [30], [31], [32], with 6,878 patients diagnosed with AF, resulting in a combined incidence of 3.53 % (95 % CI: 0.57 %-6.48 %; P < 0.01; Supplementary Figure 1).Fig. 2Prevalence of Atrial Fibrillation in the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients.3.3Comparison of AF incidence in IBD versus non-IBD patientsWe extracted adjusted effect estimates for the IBD and control groups in five studies [29], [30], [31], [32], [33]. The pooled analysis revealed that the incidence of AF in IBD patients was 1.45 times greater than that in the control group (RR = 1.45; 95 % CI: 1.21–1.73; P < 0.01; Fig. 3). As shown in Fig. 4, the subgroup analysis indicated a 1.35-fold higher risk of AF in CD patients compared to that in the control group (RR = 1.35; 95 % CI: 1.11–1.64; P < 0.01), while UC patients exhibited a 1.17-fold higher risk of AF than that in the control group (RR = 1.17; 95 % CI: 1.11–1.23; P = 0.215), highlighting a higher AF incidence in CD patients than that in UC patients (P < 0.01).Fig. 3Risk Ratio of Atrial Fibrillation in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease Compared to the Control Group.Fig. 4Comparative Risk Ratio of Atrial Fibrillation in Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn's Disease Patients Relative to a Control Group.3.4Sensitivity analysisThe overall prevalence of AF did not significantly change after one study at a time was removed (ranged from 5.97 % [95 %CI:4.78 %-7.16 %] to 6.51 % [95 %CI:5.24 %-7.78 %]). After excluding six studies published as abstracts, the prevalence was 5.87 % (95 %CI:3.79 %-7.95 %). There was also no significant change in the overall incidence of AF after one study at a time was removed (range 2.52 % [95 %CI: 0.95 %-4.09 %] to 4.40 % [95 %CI: 1.48 %-7.31 %]). After excluding one studies published as abstracts, the incidence was 3.42 % (95 %CI: −0.40 %-7.25 %). The pooled RR ranged from 1.22 (95 %CI:1.14–1.31) to 1.56 (95 %CI:1.17–2.09) after excluding one study at a time in the sensitivity analysis.3.5Publication biasThere was no evidence of publication bias for the overall prevalence (Egger's test: p = 0.55) and incidence (Egger's test: p = 0.112) of AF among IBD patients. In addition, the overall RR comparison (Egger's test: p = 0.093) between IBD and controls also suggested no significant publication bias.4DiscussionIn the present meta-analysis, we fully evaluated the prevalence and incidence of AF among individuals with IBD. Our findings indicated that the estimated prevalence of AF within the IBD patient population was 6.23 %, and the estimated incidence was 3.53 %. Notably, the risk of developing AF was 1.45 times greater in IBD patients than that in the control group, underscoring the higher incidence rates of AF among those with IBD as compared to the general population. These results suggest that IBD might be a risk factor for the development of AF. Additionally, the subgroup analyses provided evidence that patients with CD exhibited a higher incidence for AF when compared to those with UC, potentially suggesting that CD may be particularly associated with an increased risk for AF.Compared with the meta-analysis published by Goyal et al. [34], our current meta-analysis included a larger and more diverse cohort, providing a nuanced view of both the prevalence and incidence of AF in IBD patients. This approach not only mitigates potential biases but also offers a more accurate representation of the epidemiological relationship between IBD and AF risk. Our findings, which report an AF prevalence of 6.23 % and an incidence of 3.53 % among IBD patients, are further strengthened by a stratified analysis that highlights the distinct risk profiles of CD and UC.We investigated the link between the active stage and phenotype of IBD and the risk of AF, which was explored in two distinct studies. Kristensen et al.’s study [29] showed that the risk of AF escalated during periods of IBD activity, with a 2.63-fold increase (95 % CI: 2.26–3.06) during flares, a 2.06-fold increase (95 % CI: 1.67–2.55) during persistent activity, and no significant difference (0.97, 95 % CI: 0.88–1.08) during remission, compared to the control group. In the study of Sun et al. [31], compared to the control group, IBD patients with different Montreal classifications had different AF risks, with UC patients exhibiting a greater cumulative extent of disease showing a higher susceptibility to AF. In addition, the risk of AF in IBD patients with extraintestinal manifestations was 2.22 times higher than that of the control group. These findings suggest that the risk of AF is related to the degree of IBD activity, the phenotype of the disease, and the presence of extraintestinal manifestations. However, due to the small amount of data available for extraction, we were unable to pool these data for a meta-analysis.We have examined the effects of drugs used in the treatment of IBD on the risk of AF. The findings of the Choi et al.’s study [30], which analyzed drugs for the treatment of IBD, revealed that patients with IBD who were treated with immunomodulators, systemic corticosteroids, and biologics had 1.45, 1.37, and 2.37 times the risk of AF compared to the control group, respectively. Patients receiving biologics exhibited the highest risk of AF. Kristensen et al [29]. Also found an increased risk of AF in a subgroup of IBD patients treated with biologics. These findings suggest that IBD drugs, especially the increasing use of biologics, may be one of the factors contributing to the increased risk of AF associated with IBD. However, these included studies did not compare the regimens for CD and UC, nor did they address the use of antiarrhythmic medications, underscoring the need for further investigation in subsequent research.In addition to IBD, Tilly et al.'s research [33] has revealed a link between newly diagnosed AF and a spectrum of autoimmune conditions, including rheumatic fever without cardiac involvement, rheumatoid arthritis, polyarteritis nodosa, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and systemic sclerosis. Additional studies have corroborated that SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriasis are associated with a heightened risk of AF [35], [36], [37]. This suggests that the pathway through which IBD raises the risk of AF is akin to its role as an inflammatory disorder. The underlying mechanism by which these diseases increase the risk of AF is likely due to chronic inflammation, which can lead to a prothrombotic state, endothelial dysfunction, and accelerated atherosclerosis—hallmarks that are also characteristic of IBD.We observed from three out of five included studies that comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, and heart failure were more frequently reported in IBD patients than in the control group [29], [30], [31]. Consequently, we have emphasized the RR data adjusted for these comorbidities in our analysis. Even after this adjustment, four studies consistently showed a higher risk of AF in IBD patients [29], [30], [31], [33], suggesting that IBD is an independent risk factor of AF. Nevertheless, given that these comorbidities are also established risk factors for AF, they might interact with IBD in the pathogenesis of AF [38], [39], [40]. The current evidence is derived from observational studies, which inherently have limitations and needs further high-quality evidence.IBD is characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, which can lead to systemic inflammation and potentially affect distant organs, including the heart. The relationship between IBD and AF is complex and multifactorial, with inflammation playing a vital role. Central to these processes are cytokines, including C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), along with immune cells and gut microbiota (Supplementary Figure 2). IBD patients often experience an inflammatory response triggered by genetic and environmental factors, which can compromise the integrity of the intestinal barrier. This disruption results in the release of inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, CRP, IL-6, and IL-8, into the bloodstream. These cytokines then circulate systemically, reaching the heart where they can modulate the function of cardiomyocytes [41]. On the one hand, pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF can cause alterations in cardiomyocyte gap junctions by regulating the expression of cardiac connexins, resulting in delayed atrioventricular conduction [5], [42], [43]. At the same time, elevated inflammatory factors (e.g., CRP, IL-6) can also act directly on cardiomyocytes, resulting in abnormal calcium signal processing and shortened action potential and Ca2 transients [5], [44]. On the other hand, increased cytokines can also cause structural remodeling of the atrium. Liew et al [45]. Found that TNF activates the TGF-β signaling pathway and myofibroblasts, and increases the secretion of MMP-2 and MMP-9 that mediate atrial remodeling, leading to increased collagen synthesis and atrial fibrosis. These changes cause heterogeneous atrial conduction and atrial dilation, increasing susceptibility to AF.Limited evidence suggests that immune cells can directly affect the action potential or electrophysiology of cardiomyocytes by forming direct contact. When coupled to spontaneously beating cardiomyocytes through a gap junction containing connexin-43, cardiac macrophages have a negative resting membrane potential and are synchronously depolarized with cardiomyocytes [7]. This suggests that cardiac macrophages can facilitate electrical conduction through the distal atrioventricular node through direct contact and may be one of the causes of inflammation-induced AF [7].Gut microbes may also be involved in the mechanisms underlying the increased risk of AF associated with IBD. Recent studies have shown that gut microbial metabolites such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), and peptidoglycan (PAGln) can promote the occurrence of AF by exacerbating electrical and structural remodeling, oxidative stress, and autonomic nervous system dysregulation [46]. Due to the intestinal and blood barrier dysfunction in IBD, which is significantly permeable, bacterial products such as LPS can translocate into the systemic circulation [47], [48]. These detrimental gut microbial metabolites may serve as mediators of IBD-induced AF.4.1LimitationsThere were several limitations to the findings of our study. Firstly, the number of studies included was relatively small, especially studies of incidence. Secondly, our meta-analysis included 25 observational studies, lacking randomized controlled trials, and some comprised conference abstracts yet to undergo formal peer review, potentially introducing bias. Thirdly, there was significant heterogeneity in the prevalence, incidence, and hazard ratio of AF in IBD patients. Although we performed sensitivity analyses, publication bias analyses, and subgroup analyses by types of IBD, the effects of confounding factors inherent in these included studies could not be completely excluded.5ConclusionCurrent data suggest that patients with IBD are at an elevated risk for developing AF compared to the general population. The incidence is higher in patients with CD than in those with UC.6Authors’ contributionsZ-WG and C-YL designed this meta-analysis and made the inclusion and exclusion criteria.

{"PMCID": "11973393", "title": "Current exercise-based rehabilitation impacts on poststroke exercise capacity, blood pressure, and lipid control: a meta-analysis", "abstract": "ObjectivesThis systematic review aimed to evaluate the impact of post-stroke exercise-based rehabilitation programs on blood pressure, lipid profile, and exercise capacity.MethodsThrough a systemic search of literature from inception to 2024 using five databases, we analyzed data on the mean difference (MD) using a meta-analysis method to estimate effectiveness.ResultsThirty-seven randomized control trials were included encompassing various exercises such as aerobic, resistance, stretching, exergaming, robot-assisted training, and community-based training. Significant improvement was illustrated at discharge in systolic [MD 2.76 mmHg; 95% confidence interval (CI) −1.58 to 3.92, P < 0.05] and diastolic (MD 1.28 mmHg; 95% CI 0.54–2.12, P < 0.05) blood pressure and peak oxygen volume (MD −0.29 ml/kg/min; 95% CI −0.53 to 0.05, P < 0.05). We also observed significant improvement at discharge in high-density lipoprotein only after resistance exercise from two articles and low-density lipoprotein only in the intervention groups compared to the control groups from ten articles.ConclusionOverall, current exercise-based rehabilitation programs significantly improve blood pressure and exercise capacity in patients with stroke at discharge. However, lipoprotein changes remained inconclusive. Although ameliorative changes were noted in most variables, more research is needed to determine optimum exercise intensity, type combination, and health education to reduce post-stroke complications and mortality.Systematic Review Registrationhttps://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/X89FW.", "body": "1IntroductionAfter a stroke, 75% of patients develop cardiac diseases such as coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction (MI), atrial fibrillation (AF), heart failure (HF), and cardiac dysrhythmias (1–3). Schneck (4) stated that 19% of patients complained of heart problems just 3 months after a stroke, even though they had no history of heart disease. Several studies also illustrated that cardiovascular disease increased the risk of death after a cerebrovascular accident (4, 5). Among other cardiac cases, coronary stenosis (50%) and MI (3%) were more frequent after stroke (6). Moreover, ventricular arrhythmias, acute MI, HF, and cardiac death can be found among 4.1% of hospitalized patients with intracerebral hemorrhagic stroke, while it increases to 9% among subarachnoid hemorrhagic stroke patients (1). These post-stroke cardiac episodes are caused by stroke-induced heart damage, often known as stroke heart syndrome (7). Therefore, cardiac problems can also occur as a compensatory mechanism for stroke, known as neurogenic stress cardiomyopathy (NSC). Common manifestations of NSC are abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) waves, ventricular wall abnormalities, and the release of troponin, a cardiac muscle regulator protein (8). Besides NSC, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is another factor that impairs psychological stress by weakening the heart muscle after a stroke (9). However, cardiac diseases can also develop due to long-term physical inactivity and a sedentary lifestyle (5).Consequently, 20% of ischemic strokes occur due to several cardiac complications, making cardiac diseases the most common risk factor for stroke (7, 10). When other risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, and smoking, are taken into account, people with AF increase their risk of stroke by approximately 5% (10). Moreover, recent studies indicate that approximately 25% of stroke patients without a prior history of AF may develop asymptomatic AF due to cardio-neurogenic mechanisms, increasing stroke recurrence risk and raising mortality by 60% (11). Fortunately, serial 12-lead ECG monitoring within the first month of post-stroke can significantly improve AF detection. However, focusing on persistent sinus rhythm and precise differentiation between AF and ventricular tachycardia are crucial to avoid further risk (12, 13). Evidence from a cohort study demonstrated that after rheumatoid heart disease, 5.2% of the patients had an incidence of stroke (14). Lackland and colleagues (15) found that cardiovascular risk factor prevention was one of the main reasons behind the decline of stroke mortality from third to fourth in the United States. Thus, cardiovascular risk factors prevention after a stroke event is inevitable.Meanwhile, post-stroke rehabilitation comprises a variety of exercises (muscle strengthening and stretching, mobility training) and education (health education, personal grooming) to improve patients’ physical, cardiorespiratory, and cognitive performance (16, 17). Post-stroke blood pressure (BP), cardiac output (CO), heart rate (HR), and heart rate variability (HRV)—the fluctuation between two R waves—levels are essential to determine overall cardiac health and risk of stroke recurrence after rehabilitation (18, 19). Patients with depressed HVR have a lower performance rate, influencing overall recovery (20). A study on 103 subacute stroke patients found an adverse functional outcome following low HRV (18). Studies found that post-stroke cardiorespiratory fitness is not related to the factors causing stroke but to cardiovascular and pulmonary disease (21). The volume of oxygen peak (VO2peak), a measure of cardiorespiratory fitness, drops nearly 50% within a week of a stroke event compared to healthy individuals; although, stroke survivors’ often require a higher aerobic capacity to do routine work because of disability (22, 23). The walking ability of stroke survivors also declines due to low VO2peak (22).Previous meta-analysis studies mainly focus on the impact of aerobic exercise on post-stroke peak oxygen uptake and walking distance; evidence on the effects of post-stroke rehabilitation on cardiac variables and lipid profile was less explored (23, 24). Some meta-analyses illustrated the impact of aerobic exercise on BP and cholesterol levels, but the overall findings were inconclusive due to methodological errors among included studies and outcome measures (20, 25). Furthermore, a meta-analysis conducted by Boulouis and colleagues (26) demonstrated that lowering blood pressure after intracerebral hemorrhage was safe but unrelated to patients’ functional outcomes, which debriefed the relation between functional outcomes and cardiac variables after stroke. However, the impact of all types of rehabilitation protocols in intra- and inter-groups and comparing baseline and post-intervention changes on blood pressure, lipid profile, and functional and exercise capacity may provide insight into post-stroke rehabilitation and suggest guidelines to reduce post-stroke complications and mortality.Therefore, our study aimed to summarize the available evidence on the effect of post-stroke rehabilitation on BP, HR, and CO, lipid profile such as HDL, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) by comparing post-treatment changes from baseline, as well as changes between control and intervention group. The primary outcomes of our study are BP, lipid profile variables, and exercise capacity (VO2peak), and the secondary outcome is functional capacity (walking).2MethodThis study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines (27). The protocol of this review is registered and made public in the open science forum (OSF) platform (https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/X89FW).2.1Search strategies and selection of studiesFollowing PICOS (28, 29) (population, intervention, comparison, outcome, and study design) methodology, a search was conducted in five online databases (Web of Science, PubMed Central, PEDro, Cochrane Library, and Scopus) for studies that reported any of our study variables such as hemodynamic changes, physical function, and cardiorespiratory properties after post-stroke rehabilitation published from inception to June 2024. For PICOS, the population consisted of all patients participating in the post-stroke rehabilitation program. Interventions included any post-stroke rehabilitation program, including exercise and health education. Studies compared the intervention effects on any variables related to cardiovascular or cardiorespiratory and functional changes after the intervention, comparing baseline and post-intervention changes. The reported study outcomes were any of our study variables such as hemodynamics (BP, HR, and CO), lipid profile variables (HDL and LDL), exercise capacity measured by VO2peak, and functional capacity measured by the 6 min walk test (6MWT). The study design was a randomized control trial (RCT). There was no language restriction on search engines.The following keywords and medical subject headings (MeSH), and an asterisk (*), to identify associated keywords were utilized for a wide range of search results, such as “Cardi*,” “rehab*,” “Cerebr*,” “Heart (MeSH),” “Brain (MeSH),” “Stroke (MeSH),” “Hemorrhagic (MeSH),” “Exercise (MeSH),” “training,” “ischemic,” “embolic,” “thrombotic,” and Boolean/phrase “AND” and “OR.” In addition, all relevant article reference lists, previous systematic reviews, and guidelines were screened for selection (shown in Supplementary File 1).One author (MM) operated the search. Three authors (MM, LX-H, M-LL) screened all articles independently, limiting studies to the following inclusion criteria: (1) study subjects are from post-stroke rehabilitation, including both genders as participants; (2) studies wherein exercise or therapy or training program was performed (such as aerobic exercise, resistance training, community-based rehabilitation program, telerehabilitation, yoga, preventive education); (3) interventional studies, which evaluated the effectiveness of an intervention, with outcomes measured at baseline and post-intervention, with or without follow-up; (4) studies wherein outcome measurement was focused on hemodynamics, lipid profile, and functional and exercise capacity as a primary or secondary outcome, respectively. The exclusion criteria of studies were as follows: (1) studies on subjects having a stroke with other neurological commodities such as Parkinson's disease or Alzheimer's disease, cardiac disease and surgeries such as bypass surgery, and musculoskeletal or traumatic brain injury; (2) studies only focused on stroke without rehabilitation; (3) observational studies (e.g., cross-sectional association or correlation study), case reports, review articles, experimental or animal studies, abstracts, editors or experts’ opinions, and letters to editors; (4) unpublished study data or studies that failed to provide outcome data after contact with the author(s). Discussions with the supervising author (HZ) resolved any disputes regarding study selection.2.2Screening of articleWe utilized reference manager software “Zotero” (30) and “Rayyan” (31) for study screening and finding duplicates. Titles and abstracts were screened for primary selection, and full text and data availability were assessed for final study selection. The author (MM) contacted the respective authors for data availability. Any disagreement was solved through discussion.2.3Quality assessmentFor the quality of the study and the risk of bias assessment, two authors (MM and W-ZS) utilized “PEDro” (32) and the Cochrane Handbook for risk of bias assessment tool “ROB 2.0” (33). Regarding PEDro scores, studies were categorized as fair (>4), good (6–8), and excellent (9–10). The ROB 2.0 was assessed for the randomization process, deviation from the intended interventions, missing outcome data, measurement of the outcome, and selection of the reported result and categorized as low risk, some concern, and high risk. The leave-one-out forest plot checked for any ambiguity in the study data.2.4Data extractionTwo authors (MM and KM) extracted all available data independently from included studies, including first author, year, country, sample size, age, gender, inclusion criteria of participants, type of stroke and disability, rehabilitation programs (such as aerobic exercise, balance training, upper and lower limb exercise, resistance training, health education), standard rehabilitation protocol, treatment duration and intensity, treatment outcomes [BP, CO, HR, HDL, LDL, total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), FBG, VO2peak, time up and go (TUG), Berg balance score (BBS), 6MWT], follow-up, and summary of all findings (shown in Tables 1, 2).Table 1Summary of findings of all included

We considered each rehabilitation program from a single study as a distinct entry for analysis; we validated the final results of each variable with changes at post-intervention of each study's control and intervention group illustrated by the study's author, followed by the published methodology (34). We used the random effects model of meta-analysis, converted standard error data to standard deviation, and estimated the mean difference (MD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). A P-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. We utilized the software “RevMan” (35) version 5.3 and STATA version 17.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, United States) for data analysis. We assessed heterogeneity by the I2 value (inconsiderable heterogeneity, I2 < 0%–30%) and the funnel plot to identify potential outliers (36).3Results3.1Study selection and screeningA total of 9,484 articles were retrieved, and all duplicate articles were removed. A thorough screening of titles and abstracts excluded 4,855 articles, and 265 articles were assessed for eligibility through full-text analysis. Finally, 37 articles satisfied all the inclusion criteria. The PRISMA flow diagram illustrates the overall search strategy (Figure 1), and the findings of all keywords from electronic databases were tabulated (Supplementary File 1). PRISMA checklist for the abstract, full text, and other information are available in Supplementary File 2.Figure 1Study selection process from online databases (PRISMA guideline).3.2Study characteristicsThe characteristics and rehabilitation programs of the included articles were compiled in Tables 1 and 2. The data from 37 trials (37–73), all intervention and control groups, were illustrated separately in Table 2. In total, 2,337 stroke patients [minimum age of (mean ± SD) 54 ± 8.98 years and a maximum of (mean ± SD) 74.7 ± 9.3 years] who participated in various rehabilitation programs (minimum duration of 4 weeks and maximum of 24 weeks). The inclusion criteria among articles on stroke incidence among included participants was a minimum of one week to a maximum of a year post-stroke. Ischemic stroke cases comprised 52.11% (n = 1,218) of all stroke events (Table 1). Moore et al. used the same subjects but reported different variables in two (45, 46) studies in different periods.Additionally, sixteen articles (37, 38, 40, 41, 43, 44, 49, 53, 55, 57, 63–65, 67, 69, 72) investigated aerobic exercise (such as walking and cycling); six articles (40, 45, 48, 54, 59, 62) compared the effect of health education training; one article (50) included exergaming exercises; one article (70) involved robot-assisted walking training; and three articles (39, 42, 73) involved dynamic and resistance training. Exercise sessions lasted no more than 60 min, were performed three times/week, and were of varying intensity based on ratings of perceived exertion (14–16) and maximum heart rate (40%–95%). Exercise-based rehabilitation programs of all included articles are tabulated in Table 2.3.3Risk of bias and study qualityAll included articles were evaluated using the “PEDro” and the ROB 2.0 tool. According to the PEDro score, 26 articles (37–41, 45, 46, 48–50, 53–56, 58, 59, 61, 62, 65, 66, 68–73) scored between 6 and 8, which is considered significantly good quality, and the remaining articles were regarded as fair quality (Table 1). None of the articles was excluded due to low quality. Furthermore, only three articles (39, 55, 57) had a high risk, and nineteen articles (42, 46, 48, 49, 53–56, 58, 59, 61, 63, 65, 67–71, 73) had a low risk of bias according to the results of the ROB 2.0 tool. Some concerns were noted in other articles due to the selection of reported results and the randomization process (Supplementary File 3).3.4Post-rehabilitation changes in BP, HR, and COFrom 19 articles (37–40, 44, 45, 48, 52, 54, 57–62, 64, 68, 69, 72), we analyzed stroke patients’ SBP from baseline (number of patients, n = 1,146) and after discharge (n = 1,144). Cumulative results showed that the reduction of SBP after discharge was significant (MD 2.75 mmHg; 95% CI 1.58–3.92; P < 0.05, I2 = 0%), similar results were found in the comparison of baseline and discharge changes between control and intervention group (P < 0.05) (Figure 2), but the subgroup analysis of aerobic exercise, resistance training, and standard care from baseline to discharge shows insignificant reduction but tends to be positive effect (Supplementary File 4A). Notably, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) from baseline (n = 1,173) and after discharge (n = 1,168) from 18 articles (37–40, 44, 45, 48, 52, 54, 57–62, 68, 69, 72) showed significant declination (MD 1.28 mmHg; 95% CI 0.45–2.12 mmHg; P < 0.05, I2 = 0%), but in the comparison of baseline and discharge changes between control and intervention group, this improvement was insignificant (P > 0.05, I2 = 0%) as well as from all subgroup analysis (Supplementary File 4B). We analyzed stroke patients’ physiological variables (such as HR and CO) to find insightful explanations for these challenges. We found post-rehabilitation HR changes from eleven articles (38, 39, 44, 52, 56, 57, 60, 61, 64, 68, 72) (Figure 3) and CO changes from three articles (41, 45, 46) (Supplementary File 5) at discharge, and the comparison of baseline and discharge changes between the control and intervention group was insignificant (P > 0.05) but ameliorative. However, concerning the positive impact of rehabilitation, our study recommends modification of post-stroke rehabilitation protocol in terms of exercise intensity, duration, and frequency to have a significant outcome.Figure 2Blood pressure changes (A) baseline to post-intervention and (B) difference in pre- and post-intervention at the control and intervention groups after post-stroke rehabilitation programs.

However, subgroup analysis at discharge on resistance training found significant changes [MD −0.18 (95% CI −0.22 to 0.14), P < 0.05, I2 = 0%] (Figure 4A). LDL from nine articles (37, 40, 44, 45, 48, 49, 52, 62, 73) (n = 659) at discharge [MD 0.01 (95% CI −0.08 to 0.09), P > 0.05, I2 = 0%] and subgroup analysis at discharge was insignificant (Figures 4B,C). Further, the comparison of baseline and discharge changes between the control and intervention group found significant changes [MD 0.18 (95% CI 0.06–0.29), P < 0.05, I2 = 0%] (Figure 4D). These changes suggest that all intervention groups’ exercise may have had a higher impact due to the type of exercise combination than those of control groups at discharge, which requires further validation using cross-over control trial methods. TC from 10 articles (37, 38, 40, 45, 49, 52, 54, 58, 61, 73) (n = 491) found insignificant improvement at discharge and between groups (P > 0.05) (Supplementary File 7). Nonetheless, TG from six articles (37, 49, 52, 62, 69, 73) (n = 399) found significant improvement at discharge [MD 0.10 (95% CI 0.01–0.18), P < 0.05, I2 = 0%] (Supplementary File 8A). Furthermore, the comparison of baseline and discharge changes between the control and intervention group found insignificant changes [MD 0.10 (95% CI −0.04 to 0.24), P < 0.05, I2 = 0%] (Supplementary File 8B).Figure 4Subgroup analysis from baseline to post-intervention changes.

However, a significant improvement was found in the comparison of baseline and discharge changes between the control and intervention group [MD −2.27 ml/kg/min (95% CI −3.01 to −1.54), P < 0.05, I2 = 0%] (Figure 5).Figure 5(A) VO2 changes baseline to post-intervention and (B) difference in pre- and post-intervention at the control and intervention groups. SD, standard deviation; IV, inverse variance; CI, confidence interval; df, degree of freedom.Post-stroke rehabilitation significantly improved functional capacity measured in 6MWT from 12 articles (42, 43, 45, 49, 50, 53, 55–57, 60, 63, 66) (n = 448) and found significant changes at discharge [MD −27.15 m (95% CI −45.11 to −9.18), P < 0.05, I2 = 49%], but the comparison of baseline and discharge changes between the control and intervention group found insignificant changes [MD −13.61 m (95% CI −39.95 to 12.73), P < 0.05, I2 = 31%] (Supplementary File 9). Furthermore, BBS (n = 123) improved significantly at discharge than baseline [MD −3.39 (95% CI −5.04 to −1.75), P < 0.05, I2 = 52%], as well as changes between control and intervention groups from one article (45) (n = 40) (P < 0.05) (Supplementary File 10). Contrarily, TUG (39, 46) (n = 62) test has an insignificant change after post-stroke rehabilitation at discharge [MD 1.76 (−0.49 to 4.01), P > 0.05, I2 = 0%] and the comparison of baseline and discharge changes between the control and intervention groups [MD 2.67 (−0.81 to 6.14), P > 0.05, I2 = 0%] (Supplementary File 11). These results suggest an overall deterioration in functional outcomes in different measures. In line with previous studies, our study also emphasizes that standardized and personalized measurement tools must be developed to prescribe exercise for people with stroke, concerning exercise principles such as specificity, overload, and reversibility for better outcomes (74).Furthermore, FBG from seven articles (38, 48, 49, 54, 58, 62, 73) (n = 544) found significant changes at discharge [MD 0.15 (95% CI 0.04–0.26), P < 0.05, I2 = 0%] and the comparison of baseline and discharge changes between the control and intervention group [MD 0.17 (95% CI 0.03–0.30), P < 0.05, I2 = 0%] (Supplementary File 12). Moreover, homocysteine level changes from two articles (48, 49) (n = 87) found an insignificant (P > 0.05) improvement after the post-stroke rehabilitation program (Supplementary File 13).3.7Publication bias and sensitivity analysisWe analyzed publication bias (75) using the funnel plot for variables, which included over ten studies; none of our results presented potential bias (shown in Supplementary Files 4, 6, 8, 10, 11). Sensitivity analysis (76) was done using the leave-one-out method. If any studies significantly impact overall results on any variables, we excluded that study from the analysis. Moreover, our findings suggest that all post-rehabilitation interventions enact no potential risk on outcomes.4DiscussionThis systematic review and meta-analysis sought to evaluate the extent to which a rehabilitation program impacts cardiac health (BP, HR, and CO), lipid profile variables (HDL and LDL), exercise capacity (VO2peak), and functional capacity (6MWT) in patients after stroke. We included all RCTs that evaluated these changes among stroke survivors at any stage. Using the meta-analysis method, we analyzed the outcome data for the mean difference at discharge from baseline from all groups and changes (baseline to post-intervention) at discharge between control and intervention groups. The results of all variables at discharge are graphically presented in Figure 6. This result provides a comprehensive conclusion on the overall exercise-based rehabilitation programs practiced for patients with stroke. Notably, our study indicated that, whereas BP, functional, and exercise capacity improved significantly following rehabilitation programs, lipid level control was insignificant but ameliorative. These findings support modifying the post-stroke rehabilitation protocol and prioritizing cardiac health as a surrogate measure of rehabilitation outcome.Figure 6Effect of exercise-based rehabilitation among post-stroke patients at discharge. This image was created using elements from Canva, licensed under Free Content License.BP reduction is vital to controlling stroke risk factors (26). Numerous pieces of evidence stated that >5.2 mmHg reduction of SBP can reduce the odds of having a recurrent stroke by up to 22% (77). Among combined exercise training groups, SBP and DBP reduction was significant. However, subgroup analysis showed an inconsistent effect, supporting both findings from a Cochrane review among 2,797 patients and a meta-analysis, which compared only aerobic exercise effects after rehabilitation and found an inconsistent effect on SBP and DBP (77, 78). Our analysis indicates that the underlying reason for this inconsistency could be the effect of exercise intensity. A recent RCT study emphasized that the intensity of training programs during stroke rehabilitation is pivotal to improving cardiac health and functional capacity (79). High-intensity treadmill training at a peak heart rate of 85%–95% (40) and high-intensity aerobic exercise training (brisk walking, cycling, marching) among 50 stroke patients showed significantly improved functional capacity (49). Nevertheless, growing evidence suggests that exercise intensity and exercise-induced fatigue burden patient recovery during rehabilitation (20).HR is a precursory variable for assessing and reducing cardiovascular risk factors (80). After ischemic stroke, a higher HR at baseline correlated to higher cardiovascular risk and mortality (81). Mean HR increased to 10 beats/minute (bpm) from baseline (60 bpm), increasing the cardiovascular risk hazard ratio to approximately 0.39 (82, 83). Thirty-day mortality increases by 2.5% in ischemic stroke patients with atrial fibrillation for mean HR increases each one bpm over 80 bpm (81). HR and HRV changes occur inversely (84). Nozoe et al. illustrated that early mobilization after an ischemic stroke would cause neurological deterioration, which diverges the sympathetic nervous activity to affect HRV, identified by the fraction of low frequency and high frequency (19). In clinical practice, to identify and adjust the HRV to find the best possible training program for a stroke patient, a new training method called “the self-generate physiological coherence system” was designed based on the brain–heart interaction and pressure concept, demonstrating higher recovery and patient satisfaction (20). Our findings, backed by other studies, found that after a rehabilitation program, the resting HR of stroke patients decreased insignificantly (18, 80). These findings suggest that to develop a personalized rehabilitation program, one needs to focus on HRV and plan to decrease resting HR.Furthermore, increased HDL reduces the risk of ischemic stroke (85). Conversely, an LDL level of <3.9 mmol/L after stroke can minimize cardiovascular risk (86). Our study is in line with previous findings that the reduction of LDL and TC and improvement of HDL are insignificant after post-stroke rehabilitation (25, 77). However, we found that after resistance exercise, HDL improvement was significant. Yang and colleagues (87) found a robust correlation between a decrease in total cholesterol/HDL ratio and an increase in VO2peak, although the level of evidence was reported as low. Our meta-analysis of four RCTs on post-stroke rehabilitation reported an improvement in VO2peak in comparing baseline and discharge changes between the control and intervention group in MD −2.97 ml/kg/min (95% CI −3.01 to −1.54). This finding is similar to two other meta-analyses, 1 of 13 RCTs in MD 2.53 ml/kg/min (95% CI 1.78–3.29) and another of 12 RCTs in MD 2.27 ml/kg/min (95% CI 1.58–2.95) on cardiorespiratory fitness in stroke patients’ after exercise (88, 89). Therefore, 1 ml/kg/min of VO2peak improvement reduces 15% of mortality risk among coronary artery patients (90). However, mortality risk after stroke increases by elevated HR rather than the level of VO2peak of patients with stroke (81). Furthermore, a Cochrane review stated that cardiorespiratory fitness training is feasible for the stroke population and improves walking capability and balance (78). Our findings also showed that stroke survivors covered significantly greater walking distances in 6MWT and BBS scores improved after rehabilitation.Improving health-related knowledge among stroke patients can also improve their cardiac health (91). One of our included studies used an Android health application among 1,299 stroke patients to remind them about a healthy lifestyle through voice and text message services. Significant improvements in their cardiac health, such as BP and lipid profile, were found (51). A nurse-led health education study, including 268 patients, showed similar findings (47). Furthermore, In line with previous studies, specific exercise-based rehabilitation (aerobic, resistance) can sufficiently improve post-stroke blood pressure and functional or exercise capacity; yet, the improvement on some cardiac variables (HR, CO) or lipid profile variables (LDL, TC) is still inconclusive (55, 57, 64, 73). A growing number of RCT studies compared the effects of exercise-based rehabilitation with sham groups, while the intervention group exhibits a higher impact due to program design (55, 65, 72). To alleviate these, we recommend more cross-over randomized control trials on our study variables among post-stroke patients. However, answering the root cause of this decline is beyond our study objectives; more fundamental studies on the mechanism of NSC are recommended, as mentioned before. Thus, our study, in line with other meta-analyses, suggests that aerobic exercise has higher benefits than other exercise training and should be included as a fundamental exercise program for stroke survivors (23, 25).Moreover, Stoller and colleagues (70) experimented with robot-assisted training and illustrated that the recommended intensity is not consistently achievable among stroke patients. Increasing exercise repetition might positively impact stroke patients’ exercise outcomes (92), which requires robust evidence from clinical studies. Some studies mentioned that the HRR was at a high-intensity level (70%–85%); the evidence is still disseminated to determine the optimal exercise intensity level for stroke patients (54–56, 62). Nonetheless, during follow-up, the impact of exercise was found to have a deterioration than at the discharge level (54, 62), which may hinder overall health among stroke survivors; practicing health education (40, 59, 62) and home-based (38, 48, 69) and community-based (42) exercise programs might be beneficial and improve post-stroke QoL and mortality.Eventually, we recommend further studies in a large cohort in a randomized and cross-over control trial setting using modern technology such as a smartwatch and functional near-infrared spectroscopy to compare exercise with different intensities and repetition with health education with long-term follow-up to find the rehabilitation effects on cardiac health. A meta-analysis is required to find different exercises that impact blood pressure changes and report the risk of fatigue, syncope, and mortality rate.4.1LimitationPost-stroke rehabilitation intensely focused on the functional outcome rather than cardiac health, which led to the inclusion of fewer articles on our study topic. Our study selection criteria were not limited to treatment methods, intensity, or the stroke timeline, which generalizes our findings on rehabilitation practice. Due to data unavailability, we could not include all studies in all variables during the meta-analysis; a subgroup analysis on the time of stroke incidence and the impact of exercise was also unattainable. Considering the significance of hemodynamic changes among this population, we suggest that future research on the effect of post-stroke rehabilitation should report changes in the hemodynamic variables as reciprocal measures.5ConclusionOur study revealed that current exercise-based rehabilitation programs significantly improve blood pressure and exercise capacity in patients with stroke at discharge. However, lipoprotein changes remained inconclusive. Although ameliorative changes were noted in most variables, more research is needed to determine optimum exercise intensity, type combination, and health education to reduce post-stroke complications and mortality."}
{"PMCID": "12010308", "title": "Iron deficiency in patients with cardiogenic shock: protocol for a scoping review", "abstract": "AbstractIntroductionCardiogenic shock (CS) is a severe condition characterised by low cardiac output and often hypotension, which results in organ hypoperfusion due to cardiac failure. As a form of acute heart failure, this condition seems to share similar underlying pathological mechanisms. It is well established that iron deficiency is correlated with chronic and acute heart failure, causing worsening of the symptoms, reduction of quality of life and survival and simultaneously increasing the rehospitalisation rates for all causes in these patients. It remains unclear whether there is an association between iron deficiency and CS. The objective of this scoping review will be to determine the actual state of the art regarding the significance of iron deficiency in patients affected by CS.Methods and analysisWe will conduct a systematic review of the literature using MEDLINE and EMBASE via ‘Ovid’ (Elsevier) and Web of Science (2024 Clarivate). The goal is to analyse the incidence and clinical significance of iron deficiency in patients affected by cardiogenic shock. To gain a deeper insight into the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, the review will include basic research conducted on both human subjects and on animal models as well as observational, randomised controlled studies and systematic reviews and meta-analysis. To maximise the identification of relevant reports and reduce loss of information, a systematic search of the literature will be performed from inception until January 2025 using the terms “iron deficiency” as well as “iron”, “ferritin”, “transferrin”, “transferrin saturation”, “hepcidin” and “soluble transferrin receptor” matching these terms with the keywords “cardiogenic shock”, “acute heart failure”, “advanced heart failure”, “decompensated heart failure”, “lvad”, “left ventricular assist device”, “mechanical circulatory support”, “VA-ECMO” and “Extracorporeal Life Support”. We will also use the corresponding MeSH and Emtree terms. In order to find grey literature, we will use the OADT.org internet-based database.Ethics and disseminationNo additional ethics approval is required, as this review is based on existing research without new data collection. Only studies with ethics approval will be included. We plan to publish our findings in a peer-reviewed journal and present them at international conferences on cardiology, intensive and acute cardiovascular care, cardiac surgery and cardioanaesthesiology.", "body": "STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDYCommon limitations of a scoping review are the potential loss of information deriving from grey literature, reports in languages other than English or reports that are not included in the used medical report databases.This scoping review follows a broad spectrum research strategy, utilising multiple search terms, multiple databases and forward and backward citation searches to identify missing reports.We will include articles published in languages other than English and conduct research on a specific database for grey literature.We will use established methodologies and tools to search the literature, select the reports, extract the data and assess bias in the single studies, even if not methodologically typical for scoping reviews.Both human and animal studies will be included to assess clinical as well as pathophysiological aspects of iron deficiency in CS.This Scoping Review Protocol was written following the ‘JBI Manual for Evidence Synthesis, Chapter 11: Scoping Reviews’1 and is being reported in accordance with the ‘PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR): Checklist and Explanation’2In case of changes in the protocol, we will report this, mentioning the rationale for the changes.The scoping review will be sustained by the clinic for Cardioanesthesiology and Intensive Medicine as well as by the clinic for Heart, Thoracic and Vascular Surgery of the ‘Deutsches Herzzentrum der Charité–Universitätsmedizin’ Berlin; Germany.IntroductionRationale Cardiogenic shock (CS) is a severe and acute form of heart failure (HF) characterised by hypoperfusion of vital organs due to a reduction of the cardiac output, which is secondary to different pathological mechanisms. Various definitions have been applied to this condition,37 including both clinical and haemodynamical parameters. Recently, these more (invasive) haemodynamic definitions shifted towards clinical definitions in order to allow easier diagnosis and a staging of the severity of CS was introduced by the ‘Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions’ (SCAI) in 2019 (SCAI-Classification),8 which was shown to strongly correlate with the mortality both in the cardiac9 and in the cardiac surgery intensive care unit.10CS is defined as a condition in which persistent hypotension (systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg or mean blood pressure less than 65 mm Hg for usually 30 min or longer) or the need for catecholamines is correlated with signs and symptoms of hypoperfusion, including oliguria, altered mental status, cool extremities and pulmonary congestion (in case of left ventricular failure). Despite advances in the management of underlying conditions, including coronary interventions and drug-based therapies, the incidence of CS has increased in the past decades1113 and the outcome remains poor with mortality rates ranging from 20% to 40% depending on the phenotype and severity of CS.101214 15Iron deficiency is a highly prevalent condition among patients affected by chronic and acute HF. Many observational studies have suggested a correlation between iron deficiency and poor outcomes, including reduced quality of life and high rehospitalisation rates.1619 However, the precise mechanism through which iron deficiency contributes to cardiac pathology remains unclear. Intense research has been conducted on this topic, and randomised controlled trials have shown the efficacy of iron substitution in patients affected by both chronic2022 and acute23 24 HF. For this reason, iron implementation was introduced as a therapy with a level of evidence IIb in the ‘2016 ESC guidelines for diagnosis and management of acute and chronic heart failure’6 and a level of evidence 2 a in the ‘2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure: A Report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Joint Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines’25 in patients with chronic HF and after acute decompensation of HF.ObjectivesThe objective of this scoping review will be to examine the current literature to define the association between iron deficiency and the most severe form of HF, i.e. CS, and find similarities to the established relationship between iron deficiency and the other forms of HF.Methods and analysisSearchesWe will perform a systematic review of literature published from inception until January 2025 using MEDLINE and EMBASE via ‘Ovid’ (Elsevier) and Web of Science (2024 Clarivate) databases. Additionally, we will include posters presented at international congresses that have not been published in journals, as well as grey literature using OATD.org (Open Access Theses and Dissertations), an international internet-based thesis and dissertations archive.Search strategies and inclusion criteriaThe search will be conducted by two independent reviewers on the same date (LG and DC).Search strategy for MEDLINE and EMBASEWe will primarily perform a phrase search using the terms\niron deficiency.ti,ab,kw.\n\niron.ti,ab,kw.\n\nferritin.ti,ab,kw.\n\ntransferrin.ti,ab,kw.\n\ntransferrin saturation.ti,ab,kw.\n\nhepcidin.ti,ab,kw.\nsoluble transferrin receptor.ti,ab,kw.matched with the Boolean logic term ‘OR’.

Additionally, we will review observational studies (retrospective and prospective, cohort, case-control, cross-selection studies, etc.), randomised controlled trials on iron substitution in patients affected by CS and acute or acutely decompensated HF and systematic reviews and meta-analysis if the provided information is relevant to the aim of the scoping review.The definition used for diagnosing iron deficiency is very inhomogeneous through the literature. We will not prioritise a specific definition over another and will include all reports independently of the definition chosen by the authors.Iron deficiency is often associated with anaemia, a comorbidity known to impact prognosis and outcomes of HF patients. In order to distinguish between the impact of iron deficiency and anaemia, we will include all reports explicitly stating that the researched comorbidity is iron deficiency. Reports on iron deficiency-dependent anaemia will be included with a specific mention. Reports analysing the effect of anaemia without mentioning iron deficiency or those considering forms of anaemia different than iron deficiency-associated anaemia will be excluded.Articles written in any language will be considered. In case of reports not written in English, German or Italian, we will consider eligibility only if a coherent translation can be provided by automatic language translation tools (eg, Google Translate).Comments, editorials, narrative reviews, case reports, as well as economic analyses will be excluded from the review as they do not align with the objectives of the scoping review.In order to provide a figurative explanation of the included and excluded reports, we will use the PRISMA 2020 flow diagram for new systematic reviews27 as shown in figure 1.Figure 1PRISMA 2020 flow diagram for new systematic reviews which included searches of databases and registers only. *Consider, if feasible to do so, reporting the number of records identified from each database or register searched (rather than the total number across all databases/registers). **If automation tools were used, indicate how many records were excluded by a human and how many were excluded by automation tools. Source: Page et al.27Outcome measuresIn observational and randomised controlled studies and in systematic reviews and meta-analysis, the primary endpoint will be the incidence of iron deficiency in populations with CS. Secondary endpoints will include difference in 30-day, in-hospital and ICU mortality, SCAI stage, duration of ICU and hospital stay, use of mechanical circulatory support, duration of mechanical circulation as well as use and duration of mechanical ventilation in patients with versus without iron deficiency.For articles on basic research on animals and human models, endpoints will focus on the pathophysiological association between iron deficiency and CS or acute, advanced or decompensated forms of HF.Duplicates exclusion and report selectionTo avoid duplications in the researched data, we will use web-based duplicate identification tools such as ‘Systematic Review Accelerator’28 29 (Bond University and Institute for Evidence-Based Healthcare, Robina, Australia), Sciwheel (2022 Technology for Sage) and EndNote (2024 Clarivate). The selected reports will be screened by title and abstract, and non-pertinent reports will be excluded. Once all reports assessed for eligibility are selected, we will perform a selection by full text in order to identify the relevant records and outsource all materials that are inconsistent with the goal of this review. All these steps will be conducted by two independent reviewers (LG and DC).After identifying all selected studies, we will confront the selected reports using the ‘Disputatron’ tool in the ‘Systematic Review Accelerator’. In case of non-univocal selection, the two screeners will discuss each report in order to decide for selection or exclusion. Further discrepancies will be resolved by a third independent member of the review team.Data extraction and analysisIn order to extract the data from the selected articles, we will use a standard Data Collection Form proposed by ‘JBI Manual for Evidence Synthesis, Chapter 11: Scoping Reviews: 11.2.7 Data extraction’,1 the ‘Recommendations for the extraction, analysis, and presentation of results in scoping reviews’30 as well as the ‘Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) Checklist’.2The information for data collection will include:Author(s).Year of publication.Origin/Country of origin.Aims/purpose.Population and sample size (if applicable).Methodology/methods.Intervention type/duration.Outcome measures.Key findings that relate to the scoping review question(s).We will group reports depending on the different definitions used for the diagnosis of iron deficiency, in order to evaluate whether diverse definitions have different impacts on the development and prognosis of CS.We will primarily analyse reports about the comorbidity ‘iron deficiency’ as well as articles about iron deficiency-associated anaemia or iron deficiency plus anaemia. We will report results separately depending on the comorbidity, in order to reduce the risk of bias due to the confounding effect of anaemia on the prognosis of these patients or cross-effects of one comorbidity on the other.We will use graphic representation in order to divide the reports depending on the definition of iron deficiency and number of comorbidities (iron deficiency alone or anaemia with iron deficiency).After the identification of all selected studies, we will subdivide them into the following topics: ‘basic research on animal models’, ‘basic research on human models’, ‘observational studies’ (both retro- and prospective) and ‘intervention trials and systematic reviews/meta-analysis’. We will perform a descriptive, narrative analysis of the extracted information from the selected reports. Special attention will be given to the funding source of the studies and potential conflicts of interest of the authors.In case of missing or unclear study data, we will contact the authors of the original articles for further information.Contact through electronic mail will be attempted up to a maximum of three times.Risk of biasGenerally, the determination of risk of bias is not typical in the methodology of scoping reviews. Nevertheless, we decided to include this additional evaluation (as established by tool 12 of the ‘Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) Checkliste’2) to provide the highest quality of evidence for our scoping review.In order to assess the possible risk of bias for each report, if applicable in the specific case, we will collect information using the Cochrane Collaboration tool for assessing the risk of bias (Table 8.5.a in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions), which covers sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data (eg, dropouts and withdrawals) and selective outcome reporting. We will divide the reviewed articles into high and low risk of bias. In case of insufficient information, we will define the risk of bias as uncertain and contact the authors for further information.In order to evaluate the risk of bias for observational studies, we will use the ROBINS-I tool31 for intervention studies and the ROBINS-E tool32 for exposure studies.For articles reporting animal studies, we will use the ‘SYRCLE’s risk of bias for animal studies. This tool was developed based on the Cochrane RoB tool and was adjusted for specific risk of bias that plays a role in animal intervention studies.33In order to evaluate the quality of systematic reviews, we will use the AMSTAR two tool.34Two reviewers (LG and DC) will carry out this process independently to minimise bias in the analysis.We plan to analyse all studies we will find in the literature search and will highlight the bias risk (high, low or uncertain) without omitting any result.Patient and public involvementNo patient representatives or members of the public were directly involved in the planning, design, conduct or reporting of this protocol, and no primary data were collected.Ethics and disseminationNo additional ethics approval process will be required for this research, as this review analyses and synthesises existing research rather than conducting new data collection.We will only include studies which underwent an ethical approval process in the institution where the research was performed.We plan to present the results of our scoping review in a peer-reviewed journal and at international conferences regarding cardiology, intensive and acute cardiovascular care, cardiac surgery and cardioanaesthesiology."}
{"PMCID": "12088942", "title": "Impact of visceral obesity on postoperative outcomes in colorectal cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis", "abstract": "BackgroundThis systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the impact of visceral obesity (VO) on postoperative outcomes in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients.MethodsPrimary studies were obtained from sources like Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science during the search, which ran until October 2024. Patients with colorectal cancer who had visceral obesity (VO) and those who did not were compared in terms of intraoperative conditions, postoperative outcomes, postoperative complications, and long-term prognoses, including overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS).Results5,756 individuals with VO and 5,373 patients without VO were among the 11,129 patients who had colorectal cancer resected. Patients with VO had higher conversion rates (p = 0.03), fewer lymph nodes removed (p = 0.05), and longer recovery times for bowel movements (p = 0.009). Furthermore, patients with VO had a considerably greater overall incidence of sequelae than those without (p = 0.0003), including anastomotic leaks (p = 0.01), intestinal obstruction (p = 0.0003), intra-abdominal abscesses (p = 0.004), wound infections (p < 0.00001), and pulmonary problems (p = 0.0003). OS and DFS, however, did not differ between the two groups (p > 0.05).ConclusionsColorectal cancer patients with VO who have surgery tend to have fewer lymph nodes taken, more problems after surgery, and a higher rate of switching to open surgery.", "body": "1IntroductionColorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common gastrointestinal malignancies globally, ranking third in incidence and second in mortality (1). Although curative surgery remains the most effective treatment for colorectal cancer, the incidence of postoperative complications remains high, reaching up to 35% (2). These complications are not only related to the surgery itself but are also influenced by the patient’s overall health and other non-surgical factors.After potentially curative surgery for colorectal cancer, prognosis and treatment decisions are typically based on tumor pathology. However, an increasing body of research indicates that tumor staging is not the only factor determining patient outcomes. Body composition has increasingly been recognized as playing an important role in prognosis. Body composition parameters, such as obesity, are strongly linked to the prognosis of colorectal cancer. Epidemiological studies have shown that obesity is a significant risk factor for colorectal cancer (3). Furthermore, obesity is considered a risk factor for postoperative complications in various abdominal surgeries (4). However, the impact of obesity on colorectal cancer prognosis remains controversial. Some studies report worse outcomes in both obese (5, 6) and underweight patients (7), while others have not observed such associations (8).Visceral obesity (VO) refers to the excessive accumulation of intra-abdominal adipose tissue and is generally considered a more accurate indicator of obesity than body mass index (BMI) (9, 10). Due to its central role in metabolism and its potential impact on postoperative recovery, accurately measuring visceral fat may have significant clinical value in the preoperative risk assessment of colorectal cancer patients. Compared to traditional BMI, computed tomography (CT) provides a more precise and reproducible method for measuring visceral fat area (VFA) (11). In the preoperative evaluation of colorectal cancer patients, abdominal CT imaging is routinely used not only to screen for metastatic disease but also to assess visceral fat accumulation.This study aims to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore the impact of VO, measured exclusively by CT imaging, on the prognosis of colorectal cancer patients. Specifically, the study will evaluate the predictive value of visceral obesity for both short-term outcomes, such as postoperative complications, and long-term outcomes, including overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS), following elective colorectal cancer surgery.2Materials and methods2.1Search strategyThe search was conducted until October 2024, and primary studies were retrieved from databases such as Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science. “Colorectal cancer,” “visceral obesity,” and “visceral fat area” were among the search terms. The comprehensive search approach is available in \nSupplementary Appendix 1\n.2.2Inclusion and exclusion criteriaThe following requirements had to be fulfilled for a study to be included: (1) all patients had been diagnosed with colorectal cancer and treated surgically; (2) patients had a CT scan prior to surgery, and VFA was measured; (3) the article includes intraoperative information or short-term or long-term postoperative outcomes. The study with more recent data collection or more extensive data was preferred among several papers written by the same researcher from a certain university.Studies that satisfied any of the following requirements were disqualified: (1) did not employ CT scans to evaluate VFA for diagnosing VO; (2) did not compare patients with and without VO; (3) was not published in English; and (4) was a conference abstract, case report, review article, or letter.2.3Data extractionDetailed information, including the names of the authors, study duration, year of publication, type of surgery performed, sample size, mean age of participants, gender distribution, study location, diagnostic criteria, length of hospital stay, operative time, intraoperative blood loss, number of lymph nodes retrieved, conversion rates, reoperation rates, postoperative readmission and mortality rates, overall and severe complication rates, the incidence of specific complications, and OS and DFS outcomes, was included in the compiled data.2.4Study qualityUsing the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS), we assessed the calibre of the research that were part of our review. The maximum score on this scale is nine points. Research is considered methodologically sound if it receives a score of six or higher.2.5Statistical analysisRevMan 5.4 and Stata 12.0 software were used for the data analysis. Weighted mean differences (WMD) were applied to continuous variables, odds ratios (OR) to binary variables, and hazard ratios (HR) to survival data. Heterogeneity between studies was evaluated using the I2 statistic. For I2 values of 50% or less, a fixed-effects model was used; for I2 values more than 50%, a random-effects model was used. To evaluate publication bias, funnel plots were employed in conjunction with Begg’s and Egger’s tests. Statistical significance was defined as a P-value of less than 0.05.3Results3.1Selected articles1231 publications were selected during the first search phase. 28 (12–39) researches were eventually included in the meta-analysis after these publications were reviewed (\nFigure 1\n).Figure 1Flowchart of the search strategy.3.2Study characteristics and study qualityThe characteristics of the studies that were part of the analysis are compiled in \nTable 1\n. From 2005 to 2024, these studies were carried out in Japan, Korea, China, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, the United States, Scotland, Canada, Italy, Chile, and Denmark. 5,756 individuals with VO and 5,373 patients without VO were among the 11,129 patients who had colorectal cancer resected. All of the publications that were part of this investigation had NOS values between 6 and 9, which meant that the study quality was adequate.Table 1Characteristics of the incorporated investigations.StudyNationYearTime periodDefinition of VODefinition of non-VODiseaseType of surgeryPatientsFemale/MaleMean ageOttawa ScoresVONon-VOVONon-VOVONon-VOIshiiJapan20051993-2002≥100 cm2\n<100 cm2\nColorectal cancerLaparoscopic9371/821/16N/AN/A6TsujinakaJapan20082001-2007≥130 cm2\n<130 cm2\nSigmoid colon cancerLaparoscopic686519/4935/3065.5 (41–88)64 (31–84)7KangKorea20122003-2009≥130 cm2\n<130 cm2\nRectal cancerLaparoscopic2911313/1640/7367.5 ± 9.660.9 ± 10.66YamamotoJapan20122000-2005Men: ≥ 130 cm2\nWomen: ≥90 cm2\nMen: < 130 cm2\nWomen: <90 cm2\nColorectal cancerN/A10217138/6462/10966.7 ± 9.666.3 ± 10.56WatanabeJapan20142005-2010≥100 cm2\n<100 cm2\nColon cancerLaparoscopic14419437/107122/7266.2 (35–90)64.8 (35–87)6CakirThe Netherlands20152006-2013>100 cm2\n≤100 cm2\nColon cancerOpen andlaparoscopic367197130/237147/5071 ± 1068 ± 126Chen BChina20162011-2014≥100 cm2\n<100 cm2\nRectal cancerLaparoscopic192130N/AN/AN/AN/A6MalietzisUK20162006-2011Male: ≥163.8 cm2\nFemale: ≥80.1 cm2\nMale: <163.8 cm2\nFemale: <80.1 cm2\nColorectal cancerOpen andlaparoscopic420385N/AN/AN/AN/A6ShiomiJapan20162017-2018≥130 cm2\n<130 cm2\nRectal cancerRobotic and laparoscopic8215465/6989/65NANA7YuKorea20162011-2013Male: >130 cm2\nFemale: >90 cm2\nMale: ≤130 cm2\nFemale: ≤90 cm2\nColorectal cancerOpen andlaparoscopic228012/1024/5665.1 ± 2.760. ± 1.16OzoyaUSA20172006-2015>100 cm2\n≤100 cm2\nColon cancerOpen andlaparoscopic822832/5018/1066.2 ± 10.964 ± 14.56Chen WZChina20182014-2017Male: >130 cm2\nFemale: >90 cm2\nMale: ≤130 cm2\nFemale: ≤90 cm2\nColorectal cancerOpen andlaparoscopic19118587/10461/124N/AN/A7ChoiKorea20182009-2013>100 cm2\n≤100 cm2\nRectal cancerOpen and laparoscopic979130/6741/5062.7 ± 11.459.9 ± 10.88AlmasaudiScotland20192008-2016Male: >160 cm2\nFemale: >80 cm2\nMale: ≤160 cm2\nFemale: ≤ 80 cm2\nColorectal cancerN/A543198246/29785/113N/AN/A6HeusThe Netherlands20192006-2013>100 cm2\n<100 cm2\nRectal cancerOpen and laparoscopic27213480/19273/6169 ± 965 ± 126HopkinsCanada20192007-2009Male: >160 cm2\nFemale: >80 cm2\nMale: ≤160 cm2\nFemale: ≤ 80 cm2\nColorectal cancerN/A494474142/352237/237N/AN/A6MorimotoJapan20192010-2012≥100 cm2\n<100 cm2\nColorectal cancerOpen and laparoscopic156261N/AN/AN/AN/A6Zhai TSChina20192015-2017≥100 cm2\n<100 cm2\nColon cancerOpen and laparoscopic733432/4111/2369.6 ± 9.165.8 ± 14.56HanKorea20202005-2012≥100 cm2\n<100 cm2\nRectal cancerN/A670714173/497323/391N/AN/A6PedrazzaniItaly20202012-2019Male: ≥163.8 cm2\nFemale: ≥80.1 cm2\nMale: <163.8 cm2\nFemale: <80.1 cm2\nColorectal cancerLaparoscopic1738876/9737/5169.6 ± 1164.4 ± 12.38CárcamoChile20212010-2015Male: >160 cm2\nFemale: >80 cm2\nMale: ≤160 cm2\nFemale: ≤ 80 cm2\nColorectal cancerOpen and laparoscopic26396N/AN/AN/AN/A6FrostbergDenmark20212010-2011≥130 cm2\n<130 cm2\nColorectal cancerOpen and laparoscopic13014830/10083/6571.5706DongChina20222015-2020Male: >130 cm2\nFemale: >90 cm2\nMale: ≤130 cm2\nFemale: ≤90 cm2\nColorectal cancerOpen and laparoscopic261267123/13887/18074.0 ± 6.074.1 ± 6.46FujimotoJapan20222018-2020≥100 cm2\n<100 cm2\nColorectal cancerLaparoscopic4678N/AN/AN/AN/A6GachabayovUSA2023N/A>100 cm2\n≤100 cm2\nRectal cancerRobotic106394N/AN/A57.9 ± 1259.3 ± 12.36Zhai WChina20232015-2021≥100 cm2\n<100 cm2\nColorectal cancerOpen and laparoscopic337183212/12595/88N/AN/A6ZhouChina20232013-2019≥100 cm2\n<100 cm2\nRectal cancerN/A306318105/201140/178N/AN/A6ZhaoChina20242019-2023≥100 cm2\n<100 cm2\nRectal cancerRobotic12115654/6774/82N/AN/A6N/A not available, VO visceral obesity, non-VO non- visceral obesity.3.3Length of hospital stayThe average length of stay for the VO group ranged from 6 to 15.21 days, whereas for the non-VO group, it ranged from 6 to 13.2 days (\nTable 2\n).

Although BMI has long been the most commonly used metric for diagnosing obesity, it does not adequately reflect the distribution of fat in obese individuals. This is because obesity is characterized by an uneven distribution of fat tissue throughout the body, along with localized disruptions in fat and glucose metabolism (41). Obesity can be classified into two categories based on the location of fat accumulation: visceral obesity and peripheral obesity. The assessment of VFA through CT scanning is considered the gold standard for diagnosing visceral obesity, which is predominantly found in the abdominal region (42). Early studies have linked visceral fat to the incidence of CRC, the second most common cancer worldwide (43). However, the impact of VO on survival and surgical complications in colorectal cancer patients remains inconclusive (44, 45). Therefore, we conducted this meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of visceral obesity on postoperative outcomes in colorectal cancer.We compared the data of colorectal cancer surgery patients with and without VO. We found that patients with VO experienced a longer recovery time for bowel movements, had fewer lymph nodes harvested, and had higher conversion rates. Additionally, the overall incidence of complications-including anastomotic leaks, intestinal obstruction, intra-abdominal abscesses, wound infections, and pulmonary complications-was significantly higher in patients with VO compared to those without. However, there was no difference in OS and DFS between the two groups.The quantity of lymph nodes removed during tumor excision is a crucial predictor of oncological results in addition to demonstrating the surgeon’s ability. VFA influences the number of lymph nodes harvested, either because visceral obese patients have thicker mesenteries, which can make it difficult to see anatomical planes during surgery, making the surgical field more difficult and making it more difficult to dissect lymph nodes and identify blood vessels, which leads to fewer lymph nodes being harvested (14), or because fat tissue adheres to the mesentery, making it more difficult to identify lymph nodes in visceral obese patients (16). Despite the difficulty of dissecting lymph nodes, the operating time did not increase appreciably. The findings of meta-analyses that have already been published contradict this (46). We think that even with obese patients, the operational time can be reduced after a long learning period and overcoming the learning curve, even though the process is more complex.In general, obesity, tumor size, and pelvic anatomical characteristics are the primary factors that contribute to the transition to open surgery (47, 48). Visceral obesity can further complicate the surgical field and operability, in addition to the challenges posed by limited anatomical features (49). This is specifically verified by our research.Postoperative problems serve as critical indicators for evaluating short-term surgical outcomes, particularly in colorectal cancer surgery, where anastomotic leakage is a significant postoperative complication. Thickened mesentery, oversized omentum, and excessive visceral fat are frequently seen in patients with VO. VO is a significant predictor of surgical difficulties and patient outcomes because of these characteristics (50). Anastomotic leaking is more common in VO patients due to the increased technical difficulties of surgery caused by the growth in intra-abdominal fat. Furthermore, obesity raises intra-abdominal pressure for an extended period of time, which may hinder anastomotic site microcirculation and recovery (51). Metabolic problems are strongly associated with obesity, and the inflammatory state that these abnormalities cause may have a detrimental effect on anastomotic healing and tissue repair (52). Excess belly fat increases the risk of bowel blockage because it can impede or disrupt normal intestinal movement, which in turn increases the mechanical pressure on the intestines. Patients who are obese usually have thicker mesentery, which increases the risk of obstruction by causing insufficient blood flow to the intestines. According to research, inflammatory factors such IL-1α, IL-1β, and IL-1 receptor antagonists are more prevalent in human visceral fat tissue than subcutaneous fat tissue (53–55). Bowel obstruction is more likely to occur when the intestines are altered intraoperatively since this causes the release of these inflammatory substances. This also explains the delayed recovery of bowel function in the VO group, as evidenced by the prolonged time to first bowel movement after surgery. Furthermore, too much fat raises the danger of fat liquefaction and infection, which explains why wound and intra-abdominal infections are more common (56, 57).Some negative outcomes can be improved with thorough preoperative evaluation and therapy. According to studies, visceral obesity can be successfully decreased by pharmaceutical therapies, dietary changes, exercise, and behavioral counselling (58). In addition to greatly reducing the risk of problems from surgery, preoperative reduction of visceral fat may also be taken into consideration for patients who have pneumonia or other pulmonary risk factors, especially if they are unable to bear additional respiratory harm. However, it takes time to reduce visceral fat, which may have negative consequences including tumor growth. As a result, it is crucial to perform a comprehensive evaluation of the patient’s general health and carefully consider the risks and timing of the intervention.There is ongoing discussion over the effect of VFA on the long-term prognosis following colorectal cancer surgery. According to some research, VFA is a significant predictor of DFS following surgery for colorectal cancer (59) and is regarded as a separate risk factor for OS in patients undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy for the disease (60). Contrary to the above findings, new research indicates that patients with greater VFA scores actually have longer OS (44). Notably, our study’s findings indicate that there were no appreciable variations in long-term outcomes (OS and DFS) between the VO and non-VO groups among patients who had colon cancer surgery. There are several factors that affect the association between visceral fat and the long-term prognosis of colorectal cancer, some of which are not well supported by clinical data. We think that this association may be significantly influenced by variables including hormone levels (61), patient gender (62), and tumor stage (9). Visceral fat’s endocrine effects may encourage tumor growth and recurrence in patients with early and intermediate-stage cancer, which would lower OS and DFS. On the other hand, since cancer patients frequently have a negative energy balance and a larger visceral fat content may be advantageous for survival, a higher visceral fat content typically suggests superior nutritional reserves for patients with advanced disease. The long-term prognosis of patients with colorectal cancer may also be impacted by the notable variations in steroid hormone levels (such as testosterone and estradiol) between women before and after menopause. These hormones are strongly linked to fat deposition. Nevertheless, there is currently little clinical evidence to validate these putative determinants, and the study’s data set is small. To evaluate the effect of these factors on the long-term prognosis of patients with colorectal cancer, more extensive prospective studies are therefore required.Considering the potential impact of our findings on clinical practice for colorectal cancer patients, this study highlights the importance of distinguishing between visceral and non-visceral obesity, which may lead to more targeted and effective interventions. By identifying visceral obesity as a key metabolic risk factor in colorectal cancer patients, clinicians can prioritize interventions such as lifestyle modifications or pharmacotherapy, especially for those with higher visceral fat accumulation. Furthermore, our findings may assist in the early identification of high-risk colorectal cancer patients for obesity-related comorbidities such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and fatty liver, enabling more timely interventions and improving long-term outcomes. Moreover, incorporating the measurement of visceral fat into routine screening for colorectal cancer patients can help healthcare providers better stratify patient risks and personalize treatment strategies. Overall, this study emphasizes the importance of personalized obesity management, which could significantly improve clinical decision-making, patient outcomes, and public health interventions for colorectal cancer patients.Among the limitations of this study are the following: (1) the definition of visceral obesity differed among the included studies (some defined it as VFA ≥ 100 cm2, others as VFA ≥ 130 cm2, and some studies classified it based on gender), (2) the surgical approaches used in the included studies varied (open surgery, laparoscopic surgery, and robotic surgery were used, which is another source of high heterogeneity and potential bias), and (3) there may be publication bias because the studies only included patients who had completed preoperative CT scans, while those without CT scans were excluded.5ConclusionsIn summary, patients with VO who have colorectal cancer and have surgery tend to have fewer lymph nodes removed, higher conversion rates to open surgery, and more postoperative problems. Nevertheless, OS nor DFS seem to be substantially impacted by these factors. Large-scale, prospective research from other nations and areas are still required to confirm these findings and investigate the underlying mechanisms, though, because of sample size limits and regional diversity."}

Cardiac autonomic reflex tests (CARTs) are the gold standard; they are non-invasive and clinically feasible for screening CAN. The objective of the present meta-analysis was to examine exercise’s effect on cardiac autonomic function using CARTs in T2DM.MethodsThe Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Checklist (PRISMA) was used. Electronic databases were systematically used to retrieve relevant studies after title and abstract screening. Studies utilizing exercise training with cardiac autonomic function (CARTs) outcomes in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus were included. The meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan 5.4.1, using the random effects model, and appropriate tests for heterogeneity. The Cohrane ROB-2 tool was used for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and the ROBINS-I tool for non-RCT for risk of bias assessment were used.ResultsThree studies were included (two for meta-analysis), considering the outcome of the E:I ratio, 30:15 ratio, and Valsalva ratio. The studies did not show any influence on the E:I and 30:15 ratio in the pooled analysis with a low risk of ineffectiveness for the exercise intervention. Exercise training significantly affected the Valsalva ratio. A different type of exercise intervention was utilized in all three studies. There was a low to moderate certainty for the evidence.ConclusionThe results indicate that further robust and high-quality randomized controlled trials utilizing cardiac autonomic reflex tests (which have clinical and physiological relevance) in type 2 diabetes mellitus are required for drawing conclusions.Systematic review registrationPROSPERO CRD42023445561.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13643-025-02772-9.", "body": "BackgroundDiabetes mellitus (DM) is an ongoing health emergency of the twenty-first century, with the age-standardized rate of mortality reported to have increased by 13% from 2000 to 2019 in low-middle-income countries [1]. The prevalence of diabetes mellitus is 21.4% in India, with 90% of individuals with DM having type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) [2, 3]. Cardiac autonomic neuropathy (CAN) is an underdiagnosed complication of T2DM associated with mortality and morbidity [4]. CAN is a strong predictor of silent myocardial ischemia, estimated glomerular filtration rate decline, anemia, ischemic stroke, diabetic nephropathy, and left ventricular diastolic dysfunction [5–9]. The prevalence of CAN in T2DM is reported between 15.3 and 68% [10–14]. The Indian prevalence was said to be slightly higher, between 70 and 85% [15, 16]. The wide variation in prevalence is due to the different characteristics of the population, diagnostic criteria, and definitions of CAN [17].\nThe management of T2DM is by lifestyle modification, including exercise, diet, and counseling along with pharmacological management. Exercise reduces insulin resistance, HbA1C, triglycerides, blood pressure, fat mass, strength, and lean body mass in T2DM [18]. Glycemic control is currently the primary tool for reversing or preventing CAN in T2DM [19].Cardiac autonomic function is screened using cardiac autonomic reflex tests (CARTs), heart rate variability (HRV), and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) [8]. Although HRV is an objective, non-invasive measure of autonomic function, it is over-utilized and has shortcomings. One of the reasons for limitation is the oversimplification of the relationship between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems and the frequency component of HRV [20]. Baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) is “the change in the interbeat interval in milliseconds per unit change in blood pressure” [21]. BRS is performed by pharmacological methods (that is, by intravenous administration of a vasoconstrictor drug), the Valsalva maneuver, and the neck chamber technique (non-invasive but used in research settings) [22]. Thus, the need to utilize other more accessible and non-invasive tests, such as CARTs, becomes essential. CARTs have a high sensitivity and specificity (80–90%) for cardiac autonomic neuropathy and utilize heart rate and blood pressure using a battery of 5 simple tests proposed by Ewing [23, 24].Previous systematic reviews examined the effect of exercise training on HRV, BRS, and heart rate recovery as a measure of cardiac autonomic function in T2DM [25–29]. They reported that exercise aids in inhibiting sympathetic overactivity and improving parasympathetic function in T2DM, thus improving sympathovagal balance. The present systematic review examines exercise’s effect on cardiac autonomic function using cardiac autonomic reflex tests in individuals with T2DM.MethodsThe Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Checklist (PRISMA) was used to conduct the systematic review [30]. The checklist can be referred to from the Additional file 1. The review protocol was registered with PROSPERO with the number CRD42023445561.Information sourcesThe searches were done on the following databases by two reviewers (SR and GAM): PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Ovid MEDLINE, SCOPUS, and ProQuest. The references of the included studies were also searched for relevant articles.Keywords and MeSH termsThe keywords searched were as follows: “cardiac autonomic function,” “cardiac autonomic neuropathy,” “cardiac autonomic reflex tests,” “parasympathetic function,” “sympathetic function,” “type 2 diabetes,” “exercise,” “physical activity” with BOOLEAN operators AND, OR. No other filters were applied. The search was performed from 17 August 2023 to 24 August 2023. The detailed search strategies are shown in Additional file 2.Study selectionThe citations from the searches were imported to Rayyan software. The study selection process was divided into 2 phases—(1) title and abstract screening and (2) full-text screening by two reviewers (SR and GAM), and any conflicts were resolved by a third reviewer (MN).Eligibility criteriaPopulation\nThe studies with individuals over 18 years of age, of any gender, with physician-diagnosed T2DM, managed by pharmacological (oral hypoglycemics, insulin, or both) and non-pharmacological management (diet, counseling)Studies were excluded when participants were diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus, gestational diabetes mellitus, or other genetic formsIntervention\nStudies were included if the intervention provided was exercise or physical activity. The intervention should be structured using the FITT principle (Frequency, Intensity, Time, Type), supervised, unsupervised, or both—exercise in the form of aerobic, resistance, combined, moderate-intensity continuous, or high-intensity interval trainingStudies were excluded if they involved interventions such as yoga, breathing exercises, tai chi, diet only, and acupunctureControl\nStudies were included if the control group participants were provided with medical management only or any other exercise or non-exercise-based intervention\nOutcome\nStudies with the outcome of cardiac autonomic reflex tests included resting heart rate, average deep breathing difference, respiratory sinus arrhythmia index, expiratory: inspiratory ratio, 30:15 ratio, and Valsalva ratioStudies that exclusively performed other methods of cardiac autonomic function testing (HRV, BRS, heart rate recovery) were excludedTypes of studiesRandomized controlled trials (RCTs), non-randomized controlled trials (non-RCTs), and pre-post studies were included in the review. Conference abstracts, case series, case reports, editorials, qualitative studies, commentaries, short communications/correspondence, research briefs, or letters to editors were excluded.Data extractionA customized data extraction form was used to extract data from the studies. Two reviewers performed the data extraction process. The following was extracted from the studies—age, gender, type of study, sample size, details of the intervention (FITT), and results (mean difference, mean, standard deviation, median, interquartile range) of the cardiac autonomic reflex test outcomes. If any required data was unavailable, the authors were contacted through email for the relevant information.Risk of bias (ROB) of included studiesThe Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies—of Interventions (ROBINS-I) was used for ROB assessment of non-RCTs [31]. The ROBINS-I examines the ROB based on the bias in non-RCTs based on confounding, selection of participants, deviation from intended interventions, missing data, and measurement of outcomes. The Cochrane ROB 2 tool was used for the RCT for the outcomes of E:I ratio, Valsalva ratio, and 30:15 ratio [32]. Two reviewers performed the ROB assessment independently. The third reviewer resolved any discrepancies in the ROB assessment between the other two reviewers.GRADE assessmentThe certainty of the evidence was evaluated using the GRADEpro GDT software [33]. The GRADE approach uses components such as the risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, and imprecision, along with other considerations, to evaluate the certainty of evidence in terms of low, moderate, and high.Therapeutic quality of exercise programThe international Consensus on Therapeutic Exercise aNd Training (i-CONTENT) tool was used to examine the therapeutic quality of the exercise program [34]. The tool aids in the transparent assessment of the exercise program to identify the heterogeneity of the exercise intervention. It consists of 7 items—(1) Patient selection, (2) Dosage of exercise program, (3) Type of exercise program, (4) Presence of a qualified supervisor, (5) Type and timing of outcome assessment, (6) Safety of the exercise program, (7) Adherence to the exercise program. Two reviewers performed the evaluation. The third reviewer resolved any disagreements in the responses.Data synthesisThe data extracted was entered in Microsoft Excel. Reporting of the cardiac autonomic reflex test outcomes was based on the normality of the data, that is mean, standard deviation, median, interquartile range, and mean difference for the cardiac autonomic reflex test variables. All outcomes were reported in mean and standard deviation for the included studies, except for the outcome of change in systolic blood pressure in one study. The variables of cardiac autonomic reflex tests were in natural log-transformed value in one study [35]. These were transformed into raw scores of mean and standard deviations based on a formula [36]. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.4.1 [37], and the effect sizes for the outcomes were analyzed, computed, and calculated for the cardiac autonomic reflex test parameters. The fixed effects model was utilized. Heterogeneity was checked using forest plots, chi-square test, and I2 value. I2 < 25% was considered low heterogeneity, 25% to 50% was considered modest heterogeneity, and > 50% was regarded as high heterogeneity. Funnel plots were used to check for publication bias.ResultsOne thousand five hundred ninety-five articles were retrieved through electronic databases- PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, and SCOPUS. After removing duplicates, 905 records underwent title and abstract screening, of which 32 records underwent full-text screening, and three studies were included for the review and two [35, 38] the meta-analysis. Figure 1 shows the PRISMA flow diagram.Fig. 1PRISMA flowchartROB of included studiesThe ROB of the non-RCTs [35, 38] was performed using the ROBINS-I tool, which showed a low risk of bias for most of the domains. The RCT [39] showed some concerns with respect to the outcome of the E:I ratio and the 30:15 ratio. This was mainly due to the ROB arising from the randomization process, the effect of assignment to intervention, and the selection of the reported result. The Valsalva ratio showed an overall high ROB due to the randomization process, effect of assignment to intervention, measurement of the outcome, and selection of the reported result. The ROB in the included studies is shown in Table 1.\nTable 1Risk of bias of included studiesStudyROBINS-IBias due to confoundingBias in selection of participants into the studyBias in classification of interventionsBias due to deviations from intended interventionsBias due to missing dataBias in measurement of outcomesBias in selection of the reported resultOverall biasSacre et al., 2014 [35]LowLowLowLowLowModerateLowLowBonhof et al., 2022 [38]LowLowLowLowLowLowLowLowStudy (outcome)Cochrane ROB-2ROB arising from the randomization processEffect of assignment to interventionEffect of adhering to interventionMissing outcome dataRisk of bias in measurement of the outcomeRisk of bias in selection of the reported resultOverall biasBhati et al., 2023 [39] (E:I ratio)Some concernsHighLowLowLowSome concernsSome concernsBhati et al., 2023 [39] (Valsalva ratio)Some concernsHighLowLowSome concernsaSome concernsHighBhati et al., 2023 [39] (30:15)Some concernsHighLowLowLowSome concernsSome concernsaDue to the effort-dependent nature of the Valsalva maneuverStudy designThe current review included three studies.

Most participants were reportedly on metformin, sulphonylureas, statins, insulin, beta-blockers, and calcium channel blockers. The demographic details are mentioned in Table 2. Participants who were diagnosed with T2DM, as per American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria, were included in two studies [38, 39]. One study had participants with T2DM with early and definite cardiac autonomic neuropathy (as per Ewing’s criteria) [39]. Sacre et al. reported participants with cardiac autonomic neuropathy at baseline; individuals had been diagnosed with T2DM with subclinical diastolic dysfunction [35]. All studies excluded participants with underlying cardiovascular disease, morbid obesity, psychiatric illness, or any other condition adversely affecting cardiac autonomic function [35, 38, 39].Description of interventionTable 2 shows the intervention provided to the participants in both groups (exercise group and control group).FrequencyOne study [35] reported the frequency of exercise training twice weekly, while two studies reported a frequency of 3 times per week [38, 39].IntensitySacre et al. provided moderate to vigorous intensity training using the Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) scale [35]. Bhati et al. provided moderate-intensity training based on one repetition maximum (1RM) [39]. Bonhof et al. utilized a high-intensity interval training program based on the maximum heart rate [38].TimeThe included studies reported time between 20 min to 60 min per session. The total duration of the intervention was 12 weeks [38, 39] to 6 months [35].TypeOne study reported a combined aerobic and resistance exercise program [35]. Bonhof et al. utilized high-intensity interval training, and Bhati et al. used a resistance training program [38, 39].SupervisionSacre et al. included both supervised and home-based exercise sessions [35]. Bonhof et al. and Bhati et al. reported the intervention to be supervised only at the center [38, 39].Therapeutic quality of the exercise programAll studies showed a low risk for ineffectiveness for patient selection, dosage, type of exercise program, and type and timing of outcome assessment. Sacre et al. demonstrated a low risk for ineffectiveness in adherence to the exercise program [35], while the other two studies did not describe adherence [38, 39]. None of the three studies provided details about the safety of the exercise program.

The change in systolic blood pressure improved in the intervention group only (− 13.9 ± 11.6 to − 9.35 ± 9.76 mm Hg, p < 0.05) from baseline after 12 weeks of high-intensity interval training (HIIT). No statistically significant change was observed for the Valsalva ratio, 30:15 ratio, and E:I ratio after 12 weeks of HIIT [38]. Bhati et al. reported no statistically significant change for the E:I ratio (MD 0.0, CI (− 5.59, 5.59), p = 0.44), in change in heart rate with standing (MD 3.40, CI (1.51, 5.29), p = 0.81), Valsalva ratio (MD 0.36, CI (0.10, 0.62), p = 0.47), and change in diastolic blood pressure with handgrip (MD 0.22, CI (− 3.40, 3.84), p = 0.77) between intervention and control groups. At the same time, the 30:15 ratio (MD 0.24, CI (− 0.01, 0.49), p < 0.001) showed a statistically significant improvement after 12 weeks of resistance training [39].Method of measuring cardiac autonomic functionThe study by Bhati et al. reported the time of testing of the cardiac autonomic reflex tests [39]. Sacre et al. and Bhati et al. said the cessation of antihypertensive and autonomic nervous system modifying drugs 24 h, respectively, before the testing [35, 39]. One study reported the abstinence from caffeine, alcohol, heavy exercise, and environmental considerations [35]. All three studies reported both groups’ E:I ratio, Valsalva ratio, and 30:15 ratio before and after exercise intervention [35, 38, 39]. Only Bhati et al. reported all parameters of cardiac autonomic reflex tests before and after the exercise intervention [39]. The details of the measurement of cardiac autonomic function are provided in Table 2.Meta-analysis on the effect of exercise on E:I ratioThe three studies measured the E:I ratio [35, 38, 39]. Two studies reported the E:I ratio after 12 weeks of intervention [38, 39]. Exercise training did not have any effect on the E:I ratio (Fig. 2) (mean difference (MD) 0.01, 95% CI − 0.07 to 0.09, participants = 48; I2 = 33%).Fig. 2Effect of exercise training on E:I ratioMeta-analysis on the effect of exercise on Valsalva ratioThe three studies measured the Valsalva ratio [35, 38, 39]. Two studies reported the Valsalva ratio after 12 weeks of intervention [38, 39]. Exercise training had a significant effect on the Valsalva ratio (Fig. 3) (MD − 0.10, 95% CI − 0.23 to 0.03, participants = 48; I2 = 0%).Fig. 3Effect of exercise training on Valsalva ratioMeta-analysis on the effect of exercise on 30:15 ratioThe three studies measured the 30:15 ratio [35, 38, 39]. Two studies reported 30:15 ratio after 12 weeks of intervention [38, 39]. Exercise training did not have any effect on the E:I ratio (Fig. 4) (MD − 0.01, 95% CI − 0.09 to 0.07, participants = 48; I2 = 0%).Fig. 4Effect of exercise training on 30:15 ratioGRADE assessmentThe GRADE Assessment showed a low certainty of the evidence for the outcomes of the E:I ratio and 30:15 ratio and moderate certainty for the Valsalva ratio from two studies [35, 38]. The certainty of evidence was analyzed for the study by Bhati et al. [39], which showed a low certainty of evidence for the three outcomes (E:I ratio, Valsalva ratio, 30:15 ratio). This implies that further evidence is likely to have an important impact on the confidence intervals in the present study in estimating the effect; the estimate is likely to change. The summary of findings is shown in Table 4.\nTable 4Summary of findings table—GRADE assessment.

This is the first meta-analysis considering the cardiac autonomic function in terms of the cardiac autonomic reflex test outcomes in type 2 diabetes mellitus.Exercise interventionIn the present systematic review, a combined aerobic and resistance training program [35], high-intensity interval training [38], and a resistance training program was utilized [39]. Previous systematic reviews reported improved cardiac autonomic function with combined aerobic and resistance training or only an aerobic training program in T2DM [28, 40].The autonomic nervous system mediates elevated cardiovascular responses and metabolic demands during high-intensity exercise. Previous studies indicated that the long-term modifications of the autonomic nervous system were driven by the dynamic interplay between the feedforward and feedback circuits of the central command and exercise pressor reflex. As these demands are intensity-dependent, HIIT might have promoted superior acute stress [41, 42]. Resistance training increases cardiac vagal activity and reduces sympathetic activity by affecting the baroreflex-NO axis [39]. The pooled analysis showed no effect on the E:I ratio and 30:15 ratio, which could be related to the variable impact of the different exercise interventions in the included studies. The mean difference observed for the E:I ratio in the pooled analysis for the Bonhof et al. study is higher than that observed in the study by Sacre et al. (Fig. 1). This difference is probably due to the higher effect of HIIT on respiratory parameters [43]. The heterogeneity of the treatment intervention needs to be considered for the pooled analysis. Further high-quality randomized controlled trials are needed to assess which type of intervention is needed to demonstrate an improvement in the CARTs outcomes in T2DM.Effect of exercise on E:I ratioExercise training did not affect the E:I ratio in the current systematic review. The E:I ratio is obtained from the deep breathing test. It is defined as the ratio between the six maximum RR intervals during expiration and six minimum RR intervals during inspiration. It depends on patient compliance, age, respiratory pattern, body position, and baseline and shifting heart rate [24, 44].The respiratory pattern influences the deep breathing test. T2DM and lung function are closely linked [45]. This reduced lung function in T2DM may be related to microangiopathy of the alveolar capillaries and pulmonary arterioles, chronic low-grade inflammation, and autonomic neuropathy due to loss of elastic recoil of lung parenchyma [46]. These potential mechanisms may affect lung expansion and breathing patterns along with a superimposition of other comorbidities, such as obesity, affecting the E:I ratio. There is a positive correlation between the volume of air inspired during the deep breathing test and the variability in heart rate changes in individuals with diabetes [24]. These changes may have influenced the E:I ratio change in the included studies.In the study by Bonhof et al., the participants included were overweight adults. High BMI and overweight reduce lung expansion and attenuate chest reflexes due to the influence of mechanical factors such as intrathoracic fat deposits, thereby confounding the E: I ratio [47].Effect of exercise on Valsalva ratioIn the present review, exercise training had a significant Valsalva ratio in the exercise group compared to the control group. A study by Vagvolgyi et al. reported a significant improvement in the Valsalva ratio after a 12-week exercise-based intervention in individuals with metabolic syndrome (with and without T2DM). This improvement could be related to increased parasympathetic tone [48]. A previous study reported improved baroreflex sensitivity parameters during the Valsalva maneuver with 4 months of aerobic training in individuals with T2DM [49]. This may be related to the Valsalva maneuver (one of Ewing’s tests), which was reported to have a good sensitivity of about 85% and was a good marker of CAN in T2DM [50] which may have led to a greater effect on the parameter. However, additional high-quality randomized controlled trials are needed to establish the same.India is the diabetes capital; just one study has addressed the needs of the country in terms of cardiac autonomic function [39, 51]. This study showed a high certainty of the evidence for the three outcomes (E:I ratio, Valsalva ratio, and 30:15 ratio) (Table 4). There is a wide phenotypic variation and prevalence of type 2 diabetes within the country [3]. The study by Bhati et al. was conducted in North India, considering different characteristics of the population, dietary habits, lifestyle [3], and environment [52]. It can be hypothesized that if the same outcome is checked in the other parts of India, it might give a different result considering the characteristics of the population, diet, and lifestyle. Also, the Indian phenotype of T2DM (the Asian Indian Phenotype) is characterized by low BMI, high BF%, higher HbA1C, and associated comorbidities such as obesity and dyslipidemia [53, 54]. These features in the Indian scenario may have led to exercise training having no effect.Effect of exercise on 30:15 ratioThere was no effect of exercise on the 30:15 ratio in the present review. 30:15 ratio is defined as the ratio between the longest RR interval between the 25th and the 35th beat and the shortest RR interval between the 10th and the 20th beat in the lying to-standing test [24].Considering the variable, any changes in RR intervals, such as resting tachycardia, can alter this ratio. The included studies did not have any participants with resting tachycardia. One study reported a normal resting heart rate in exercise and control groups [35]. Thus, it is possible that exercise may not have any effect on the 30:15 ratio of the RR intervals.The normal 30:15 ratio is ≥ 1.04 per Ewing’s criteria [23]. The 30:15 ratio values in the included studies were normal at baseline, and studies included participants in the early and definite stages of cardiac autonomic neuropathy. As a result, it is anticipated that the 30:15 ratio will not significantly alter after exercise.Cardiac autonomic reflex tests provide essential information regarding the parasympathetic and sympathetic systems and are considered the gold standard and relevant in the clinical setting [55]. In a busy clinical setting, the performance of all CARTs may not be possible. Previous studies have shown that the deep breathing test, Valsalva maneuver, or the lying to standing test can also be considered for preliminary screening of cardiac autonomic neuropathy in T2DM due to its high sensitivity and specificity [50, 56, 57]. Hence, these tests can be used as a measure to examine the effect of the exercise intervention in T2DM individuals. However, more studies need to explore these outcomes and examine which type of exercise training will be more effective for individuals with T2DM.LimitationsThe other parameters of cardiac autonomic reflex tests, such as the respiratory sinus arrhythmia ratio, change in systolic blood pressure with standing, and diastolic pressure change with sustained handgrip, could not be considered for the pooled analysis, although a narrative synthesis was performed.ConclusionThe present meta-analysis shows that exercise training significantly affects the Valsalva ratio based on a moderate certainty of evidence, with no effect on the 30:15 ratio and E:I ratio considering the low certainty of evidence, with good quality non-RCTs. However, the review highlighted a need for good quality randomized controlled trials utilizing cardiac autonomic reflex tests (which are gold standard and clinically relevant) in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus.Supplementary Information\nAdditional file 1.

We conduct a meta-analysis of 16 type 2 diabetes and 19 lipid trait GWAS, identifying 20 genome-wide significant loci for type 2 diabetes, including one novel locus and novel signals at two known loci, based on fine-mapping. We also identify sixty-one genome-wide significant loci across the lipid/lipoprotein traits, including nine novel loci, and novel signals at 19 known loci through fine-mapping. Next, we analyze genetically regulated expression, perform Mendelian randomization, and analyze association with transcriptomic and proteomic measure using multi-omics data from a Hispanic/Latino population. Using this approach, we identify genes linked to type 2 diabetes and lipid/lipoprotein traits, including TMEM205 and NEDD9 for HDL cholesterol, TREH for triglycerides, and ANXA4 for type 2 diabetes.", "body": "IntroductionAlthough genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revolutionized our understanding of the genetic underpinnings of cardiometabolic disease, systemic underrepresentation of Hispanic and Latino individuals has limited the potential for improving public health and precision medicine in a population with significant cardiometabolic health disparities. Many cardiometabolic diseases are more prevalent in Hispanic/Latino populations compared to Non-Hispanic White populations; for example, recent prevalence estimates of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in Hispanic/Latino populations are 15.5% and 21.9%, respectively, compared to 13.6% and 16.6% in Non-Hispanic White populations1,2. These traits are of major clinical and public health importance. Elevated blood glucose and abnormal lipid levels comprise three components of the metabolic syndrome, which has a prevalence of 36.3% in US Hispanics and is known to underlie high rates of cardiometabolic diseases, including cardiovascular, liver and kidney diseases3. With increased recognition of the importance of racially, ethnically, and ancestrally diverse participants in genetic studies4, efforts have been made to expand diversity in GWAS of complex traits5,6. However, Hispanic/Latino sample sizes remain limited. For example, recent genome-wide meta-analyses of lipid and lipoprotein (abbreviated as lipid throughout) concentrations, key biomarkers for development of cardiometabolic disease, conducted in European-ancestry populations, comprise data from ~1.6 M participants, while the largest study performed to date in Hispanics/Latinos comprised about 48,0007,8. Further, no GWAS of cardiometabolic traits in Hispanics/Latinos systematically functionally annotated gene-based findings in differential abundance analyses of transcriptomic and proteomic data directly measured in a Hispanic population.Furthermore, despite these large studies in trans- and European-ancestry samples, there remains a gap between estimated heritability (h2) and the variance explained by known variants. For T2D, a recent SNP-based h2 explains only 19% of T2D risk9, whereas family-based h2 estimates range from 20 to 80%10,11. For lipid phenotypes, family-based h2 estimates are as high as 83%7,12–16; however, even in studies of over 180,000 individuals, known variants only explain 30-33% of genetic variance17,18. Previous studies have demonstrated the benefits of studying diverse populations, both for further discovery and for deeper interrogation of established loci5,6,19,20. Extending genetic research of currently underrepresented populations is an opportunity to simultaneously work to reduce a major health disparity and to improve our understanding of genetic variation underlying these traits.Hispanic/Latino individuals represent a complex group of populations with diverse cultural traditions, foodways, religions, lifestyles, languages, cultural norms, histories, and social environments, as well as multiple sources of genetic ancestry resulting in widely varying patterns of admixture. Some genetic loci contributing to cardiometabolic traits may be more identifiable under certain environmental conditions and allele frequency differences between ancestries can affect the power to detect associations. As a result, while much of the genetic architecture of cardiometabolic disease risk is shared across populations and environmental contexts6,21, Hispanic/Latino populations likely harbor genetic effects at loci only detectable in population-specific analysis as well as population-specific variants at previously known loci22.To address this significant research gap, we performed GWAS meta-analyses in Hispanic/Latino populations for T2D and quantitative lipid traits, including high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (TC), and triglycerides (TG). We then performed a summary statistic-based transcriptome-wide association analysis, including our islet expression prediction models using data from the InsPIRE (Integrated Network for Systematic analysis of Pancreatic Islet RNA Expression) consortium23, and systematically followed up identified genes in differential abundance analyses using directly measured blood transcriptomic and proteomic data from an independent Hispanic population. These downstream analyses highlight the importance of measuring omics in underrepresented populations for functional characterization of large-scale genomic analyses.ResultsStudy demographicsCharacteristics of the study participants can be found in Supplementary Data 1. Of the 19 participating studies, 15 contributed to both T2D and lipids analyses, three contributed to the lipids analyses only, and one contributed only to the T2D analyses. Our meta-analyses included more females than males (~63% female). T2D cases had a 1.7 kg/m2 higher BMI and were 3.2 years older on average than controls.Single variant T2D meta-analysis resultsTwenty genome-wide significant loci were associated with T2D (Supplementary Data 3; Supplementary Fig 1a); six of the signals remained significant after adjusting for BMI (Supplementary Data 4). We identified one novel genome-wide significant T2D-associated locus, the intronic variant rs12344703 in MOB3B (odds ratio (OR) = 1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI): (1.03, 1.11), p = 2.26 × 10−8, effect allele frequency (EAF) = 0.79; Supplementary Data 3). Fine-mapping at the MOB3B locus resulted in a 95% credible set of 10 additional variants (Supplementary Data 5). Fine-mapping analyses for all T2D single variant results indicated that two of our T2D single variant results are novel signals in known loci (Supplementary Data 5). SNP-based heritability in our T2D meta-analysis was 0.106 (SE: 0.011).Replication of novel T2D single variant signals in DIAMANTEWe queried results from the DIAMANTE European, East Asian, and South Asian analyses to assess replication of the novel variants. We did not observe replication or a consistent direction of effect for the MOB3B variant. The signal at rs12344703 is primarily driven by effects observed in SIGMA1, however a later release of data from this project did not identify significant effects, suggesting this finding may be type 1 error24.S-PrediXcan results for T2DWe performed an S-PrediXcan analysis to identify associations between T2D and the heritable component of gene expression (GReX) in all available tissues from GTEx and islets. Across all tissues, 65 genes were identified as having GReX significantly associated with a phenotype (Supplementary Data 6). This included 19 genes that have been previously reported through single variant GWAS, 36 additional genes in close proximity to (within 1 Mb of) a previously reported GWAS variant, and 10 potentially novel genes that have neither been previously mapped to GWAS signals, nor are within 1 Mb of previously reported variants (Supplementary Data 6).Single variant lipids meta-analysis resultsAcross all lipid traits, we detected 52 known loci and nine novel loci associated with at least one lipid trait (Supplementary Data 7; Supplementary Figs 1b–e, 2c–k). One novel HDL-C-associated locus was identified with sentinel variant rs11653998 (p = 1.34 × 10−9) intronic to ERBB2 (Supplementary Data 7A). For LDL-C, two novel associations were detected, with sentinel variants rs75594955 (p = 3.41 × 10−8) located in exon 10 of TUB (p = 3.41 × 10−8), and rs186143467 (p = 1.82 × 10−13) located in the intergenic region between LOC387810 and LOC101928847 (Supplementary Data 7B). One novel locus was identified for TC; the sentinel variant rs564036749 (p = 1.02 × 10−8) is located in the intergenic region between MBIP and SFTA3 (Supplementary Data 7C). Finally, six novel loci were identified for TG: rs143891608 (p = 4.42 × 10−8), between LINC01132 and LOC101927851; rs186560848 (p = 3.84 × 10−10), between LINC02106 and LOC642366; rs181676594 (p = 3.73 × 10−10), between GFOD1 and SIRT5; rs552736307 (p = 1.94 × 10−8), between TAB2 and ZC3H12D; rs8178824 intronic to APOH; and rs557199842 (p = 1.66 × 10−15), between ZNF536 and LINC01791 (Supplementary Data 7D). Fine-mapping for our novel lipid signals identified 95% credible sets for each locus (Supplementary Data 5), and revealed novel signals at 12 known lipid loci (Supplementary Data 4). SNP-based heritability for HDL-C was estimated to be 0.101 (SE: 0.017), for LDL-C was estimated to be 0.068 (SE: 0.014), for TC was estimated to be 0.087 (SE: 0.017), and for TG was estimated to be 0.126 (SE: 0.038).Replication of novel lipids single variant signals in MVPWe queried results from the MVP European- and African-ancestry subgroup analyses to assess for replication at the sentinel variants for our novel single variant lipid results (Supplementary Data 7). Results were only available for three of our novel results; one variant, rs11653998 in the ERBB2 locus for HDL cholesterol, replicated (p = 1.97 × 10−17 in MVP European-ancestry group, p = 1.03 × 10−2 in MVP African ancestry).S-PrediXcan results for lipidsAs with T2D, we used S-PrediXcan to identify GReX-trait associations for each of the lipid traits (Supplementary Data 8). For HDL-C, 193 genes were implicated in S-PrediXcan analyses (Supplementary Data 8A), including 91 genes previously reported through GWAS, 86 additional genes in close proximity to (within 1 Mb of) a previously reported GWAS variant, and 16 potentially novel genes. One hundred sixty-eight genes were implicated through S-PrediXcan for LDL-C (Supplementary Data 8B), including 80 known GWAS genes, 67 unreported genes in known GWAS loci, and 21 potentially novel genes. For total cholesterol, 217 total genes were implicated in our S-PrediXcan analysis (Supplementary Data 8C), including 100 genes reported in GWAS, 103 genes near a GWAS variant, and 14 potentially novel genes. Finally, 220 genes were implicated for triglycerides, including 92 known GWAS loci, 99 genes in close proximity to GWAS variants, and 29 potentially novel genes (Supplementary Data 8D).Functional annotations of study-wide significant genesTo prioritize genes for future functional studies, we annotated study-wide significant S-PrediXcan genes with tissue-specific MR results. We identified nominal evidence of causal effects on T2D for 27 genes, 89 for HDL-C, 65 for LDL-C, 99 for TC, and 97 for TG (Fig. 1; Supplementary Data 6, 8). We conducted MR for all tissues (up to 49) that a gene was study-wide significant for as denoted in the additional tissues column in Supplementary Data 6, 8.Fig. 1UpSet plots of gene/protein-based findings across omics.UpSet plot (an extension of Venn diagrams to visualize overlap of more than three datasets) for type 2 diabetes (A) HDL cholesterol (B), LDL cholesterol (C) total cholesterol (D) triglycerides (E) and showing all nominally significant (p < 0.05) annotation results across gene/protein-based analyses for novel genes identified in S-PrediXcan discovery genetically regulated expression association analyses: Mendelian randomization of S-PrediXcan findings, transcriptomic association analyses, and proteomic association analyses. Intersections empty for all traits are excluded (GReX, MR, RNASeq, and Proteomics; and GReX, RNASeq, and Proteomics). GReX represents genetically regulated expression analysis (S-PrediXcan) results, MR represents Mendelian randomization results, RNASeq represents transcriptomic differential expression results, and Proteomics represents proteomic differential abundance results. Blue represents novel loci, purple represents novel genes/proteins in known loci, and pink represents known genes/proteins in known loci.To further prioritize results by directly measured differential abundance of transcript or protein, we tested study-wide significant S-PrediXcan genes for association of measured gene expression and protein level in blood with each trait in an independent Hispanic cohort to annotate our S-PrediXcan findings. All available study-wide significant S-PrediXcan genes were tested (ntranscriptomics = 53; 127; 113; 152; 138 and nproteomics = 9; 34; 31; 39; 37 tests performed for T2D, HDL-C, LDL-C, TC, and TG respectively; the number of tests performed stratified by novelty are provided in data legends).In the Discussion, we highlight genes identified by S-PrediXcan analyses with two or more additional supportive analyses (Mendelian randomization, differential transcriptomics, and differential proteomics analyses), including TMEM205 and NEDD9 for HDL-C, TREH for triglycerides, and ANXA4 for T2D.Ancestry effects in single variant findingsDue to heterogeneity of admixture patterns between the studies included in this meta-analysis, we expected to observe heterogeneity of effect by study-level differences in ancestry. However, MR-MEGA detects variants with heterogeneity that are correlated with ancestry, and, for most of our single variant results, we did not observe significant ancestry-associated heterogeneity (Supplementary Data 3, 4,7). We did identify variants that are specific to (i.e., observed only in or only at any appreciable frequency in) Hispanic/Latino and, sometimes, African-ancestry populations. One example of such a variant is HDL-C-associated variant rs188287950, which is located in intron one of SIK3. This is a known HDL-C locus including APOA4 and many variants have previously been reported within one Mb of the sentinel variant (Supplementary Data 7). We observed this variant at an MAF of 0.05 in our data, but it is only observed in Admixed American populations in 1000 Genomes Project reference data (MAF = 0.05, MAF = 0 in all other 1000 Genomes populations). This variant is also observed at an MAF of 0.10 in Latino/Admixed American populations in gnomAD, and at an MAF < 0.005 in all other populations.We also identified loci where the sentinel variant is present in other ancestry groups, but fine-mapping indicates that a haplotype distinct from previously reported associations underlies our observed signal at a known locus. An example of this is T2D-associated variant, rs1574285, at the GLIS3 locus. Nearby variants have been previously identified in other T2D GWAS, including in both the DIAMANTE European and East Asian ancestry groups25,26. However, none of the variants previously observed are contained within our 95% credible sets for this locus. These and other similar loci exhibit the importance of examining the genetic architecture in Hispanic/Latino populations for improving predictive modeling (e.g., polygenic risk scores), as has been previously noted27–29.DiscussionThousands of loci for T2D and lipid traits have been identified in GWAS and yet populations most impacted by metabolic diseases have been largely overlooked and functional interrogation of identified loci has been limited. To address these long-standing gaps, we performed meta-analyses and fine-mapping of T2D and lipid traits, functionally oriented gene-based tests, and independent functional annotation of findings in large resources of whole blood RNA sequence data and proteomics in Hispanic/Latino populations. Across all traits studied, we discovered 11 novel loci and 21 novel signals in known loci, which may constitute distinct signals from the primarily European-ancestry-derived established variants in these loci (Fig. 2), demonstrating the importance of diverse populations in genomic studies.Fig. 2Single variant result counts for each trait, categorized by their status relative to previously reported variants and loci.A novel variant in a known locus was defined as a locus that had known variants within one Mb, but no known variants contained in its 95% credible set(s). A known locus was defined as a locus with known variants contained in its 95% credible set(s). A novel locus was defined as a variant with no known variants within one Mb or contained in its 95% credible set(s). Pink represents known variants in known loci, purple represents novel variants in known loci, and blue represents novel loci. Traits included are type 2 diabetes (T2D), HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (TC), and triglycerides (TG).Aggregation of single variant meta-analysis results using S-PrediXcan both across 49 GTEx tissues and models developed here using in pancreatic islet cells from the InsPIRE consortium23 identified further loci and genes of interest. We then functionally prioritized genes associated with T2D and lipid traits using Mendelian randomization to assess evidence for causality. Finally, using a multi-omics approach, we functionally annotated these prioritized genes with differential abundance analysis results from whole blood transcriptomic and proteomic data collected from participants of an independent Hispanic cohort. Our comprehensive, multi-tiered analysis identified novel genes and novel loci for T2D and lipid traits in Hispanic/Latinos, providing evidence for future functional studies.One novel gene implicated in our single variant results for LDL-C has compelling functional evidence of impact on cardiometabolic disease. An exonic variant in TUB, rs75594955, was associated with LDL-C in our meta-regression. Mutations in TUB’s murine analog Tub produce a well-known murine model of T2D and obesity and has been shown to impact plasma lipid levels30,31. Similarly, a homozygous loss-of-function mutation in a consanguineous human family induced syndromic obesity as well as retinal dystrophy32. Expression of TUB in adipose tissue in obese individuals has also been shown to be reduced relative to non-obese controls33.In our novel single variant results for triglycerides, we observed a variant near SIRT5, which encodes a lysine deacylase. A study of the impact of SIRT5 on bovine preadipocyte differentiation and an obese mouse model showed that SIRT5 inhibits preadipocyte differentiation, as well as lipid synthesis and lipid deposition in adipocytes34. In a separate study of an obese mouse model with hepatic SIRT5 overexpression, the authors found a reduction in triglyceride levels in the liver and increased serum triglycerides, suggesting that SIRT5 may play a role in exporting triglycerides from the liver to blood35.Most of our novel single variant results did not replicate in other population groups, though this result is not unexpected. Differences in allele frequency (and therefore, power) may explain lack of replication in some cases, including for variants that are appreciably more frequent in Hispanic/Latino populations and in some cases entirely unobserved in other populations. Indeed, seven of our ten novel lipid results have a MAF < 0.01 in the 1000 Genomes Project European population, and eight of the ten novel lipid results have a MAF < 0.01 in the 1000 Genomes Project African populations. Other variants are common across many ancestry groups, e.g., rs28712821 for T2D; for these loci, lack of replication may be due to other causes. For example, difference in linkage disequilibrium at the locus may result in different tag variants for a causal variant common between ancestry groups, allelic heterogeneity at a locus may result in causal variants that differ by ancestry group, or differences in environmental risk or protective factors between populations may impact our power to observe effects.Two genes implicated for HDL-C in our S-PrediXcan discovery analysis showed both nominal evidence of causality via Mendelian randomization and association with HDL-C in our independent transcriptomic association analysis, TMEM205, and NEDD9. TMEM205 has primarily been previously linked to multiple cancer phenotypes, including resistance to chemotherapeutic agents36,37. More recently, a study of a mouse model of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis revealed a role for TMEM205 in lipid metabolism38. Our results lend further support to this proposed pathway and broaden our understanding of its impact to lipoprotein levels, outside of the context of liver disease. NEDD9 has previously been found to be near genome-wide significant in a GWAS of coronary artery disease39, and in a study of gene-gene interactions that impact lipoprotein concentrations, NEDD9 was found to interact with SMAD3 to influence HDL-C, however NEDD9 has not been previously implicated for HDL-C alone40. Our findings suggest a functional role for genetic variation at this locus, through impact on regulation of NEDD9 expression, and indicate that this dysregulation may be causally impacting HDL-C concentration.For triglycerides, we highlight two genes that were study-wide significant in S-PrediXcan and nominally significant in Mendelian randomization and either transcriptome or proteome analyses. ZNF513 was nominally associated in our transcriptomic analysis and has been previously implicated in an autosomal recessive form of retinitis pigmentosa41; neither genetic variation attributed to ZNF513 nor expression of ZNF513 has been previously linked to lipid traits, however nearby genes, including SNX1742,43, NRBP144, and GCKR8,45 have been previously identified for TG via GWAS, suggesting that this region will need further study to elucidate the role of ZNF513 and its interaction with nearby genes. ANKK1, which was nominally associated in our transcriptomic analysis, is physically near DRD2, which encodes Dopamine receptor D2. This locus has been previously linked to neuropsychiatric disorders46–48, as well as recently being implicated in a GWAS of TG7; an intronic variant in DRD2 was associated with TG in the GWAS.For T2D, we identified one gene, ANXA4, that was significantly associated with T2D status in S-PrediXcan and nominally significant in Mendelian randomization and our proteomics analysis. This gene has not been previously reported in GWAS of T2D. ANXA4 expression has been shown to be impacted by knockout variants in HNF1A and PDX149, two monogenic diabetes genes; ANXA4 was also shown to be a target gene of HNF4A50. Further, the mouse gene Anxa4 is downregulated in Ipf1/Pdx1−/− pancreatic progenitor cells23. ANXA4 is also part of the GSK3β-Ikaros-ANXA4 signaling pathway, which has been demonstrated to inhibit migration of fibroblasts due to high glucose levels51. Our finding, that expression of ANXA4 may exert causal effects on T2D risk and that ANXA4 protein abundance is dysregulated in T2D, provides compelling support of a role of ANXA4 in non-monogenic diabetes risk as well.Pancreatic islet cells are not a specific tissue type included in GTEx, yet are a central tissue in T2D pathophysiology that exhibits tissue-specific expression at key T2D genes, including INS23,26,52. Therefore, we integrated pancreatic islet cell data from the InsPIRE consortium to generate S-PrediXcan models and applied those models to our meta-analysis results. We compared the results of the pancreatic islet cell models to those using bulk pancreas tissue to identify organelle-specific genetic regulation impacting islet cells.All four S-PrediXcan associations in islets fall within an ~2 Mb region surrounding Insulin. The S-PrediXcan model for INS itself was not significantly associated with T2D (p = 0.6). Nonetheless, these genes have molecular assays supporting their role in glucose homeostasis. For example, in vitro work shows BRSK2 phosphorylates PCTAIRE1, which in turn decreases insulin secretion in response to glucose53. TRPM5 is a receptor that has been shown through knock out mice, and subsequent in vitro work to be essential for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion54. Further, chr11p15.5-p15.4 is a region known for complex imprinting, resulting in parent-of-origin-specific expression of various genes55–57. OSBPL5 has methylation disruptions in insulinomas58. This region of the genome shows evidence of complex regulation, particularly in pancreatic islets. There may be mechanisms of co-regulation involved, as it contains many genes that influence glucose homeostasis; indeed, we see evidence of potential co-regulation of the associated genes based on correlation of expression in InsPIRE gene expression data (Supplementary Fig 3), however additional work in pancreatic beta cells is required to clarify.Our S-PrediXcan analyses provide an opportunity to functionally annotate known loci, adding to our understanding of the biology of these signals by narrowing the likely causal gene(s) at the locus. In the known T2D locus on chromosome 22, we identified significant signals in both our GWAS and S-PrediXcan analyses. In our GWAS, rs16989540, in intron 27 of DEPDC5, was significantly associated with T2D status; Open Targets Genetics predicted YWHAH to be the causal gene for this signal. This locus has been previously reported in three prior studies, two of which had sample overlap with the present study and in a third study in a Maya population9,20,59. In all three studies, the signal was mapped to either DEPDC5 or YWHAH. However, S-PrediXcan functionally implicates a different gene in this locus, SLC5A1, in small intestine. The role of this gene, also known as SGLT1, in type 2 diabetes is supported by an abundance of non-GWAS evidence. Consistent with our observed direction of effect in small intestine, measured expression of this gene in the small intestine has been shown to be increased in people with type 2 diabetes60,61. Indeed, the FDA recently approved a medication, called sotagliflozin, that targets SGLT-1 and SGLT-2, reducing blood glucose and treating heart failure in T2D patients62,63. It is notable that all three GWAS that reported a signal at this locus included individuals with a large proportion of AMR ancestry, suggesting this might be a key population in which to explore drug efficacy. This is just one example of how functionally oriented analyses, using expression data from multiple tissues, can inform our interpretation of GWAS results and identify clinically actionable targets.Our study had several limitations. Most notably, we were limited by GWAS data currently available for Hispanic/Latino populations, and even aggregating many of the extant GWAS of T2D and lipid traits in Hispanic/Latino populations in this meta-analysis resulted in a much lower sample size than analogous European-ancestry studies. This limitation must be addressed by prioritization of studies of non-European ancestry populations in biomedical research. This can only be accomplished through increased funding to engage and recruit members of diverse populations as partners in and beneficiaries of biomedical research efforts. This Euro-centric bias is pervasive, ranging from genotype array design to models of gene expression. Indeed, our S-PrediXcan analyses utilized publicly available models developed in GTEx Project data, which primarily comprises European ancestry individuals, similar to most publicly available gene expression datasets. Several studies have demonstrated that prediction performance of these models is maximized by matching genetic ancestry of the model training dataset to the testing dataset64–66, however it is most likely that reduced predictive performance in cross-ancestry applications will result in a reduction in power rather than increased type 1 error67, and prior application of models derived from primarily European-ancestry data to non-European-ancestry populations has indeed resulted in robust findings confirmed through replication67,68. To address this lower power, future studies must prioritize inclusion of non-European-ancestry populations in transcriptome and other omics projects, as we have done here by generating a large resource of whole blood transcriptome data in a Hispanic/Latino population, to ensure that resources like ancestry-matched GReX prediction models, and ultimately the medical advances that discoveries from omics studies will drive, are available and accessible for all populations. Finally, this study relied on meta-analysis of available imputed data, and we did not have universal access to individual-level data. Thus, we could not explore the impact of local ancestry, specific haplotypes in a locus, or leverage more diverse imputation reference panels. Further work will be needed to follow up on loci that have evidence of being population specific.Our study reiterates the importance of large-scale studies of non-European populations for genetic discovery, presenting insight into trait biology through multiple lines of transcriptomic and proteomic data, in spite of significantly smaller sample sizes relative to current studies in European-ancestry populations. Our study also demonstrates how precision medicine advances can be made when we integrate GWAS with functional characterization through omics data, revealing candidate genes and functional variants. It is our hope that current and future efforts that prioritize inclusion of Hispanic/Latino populations, such as the All of Us research program69 and the Mexico City Prospective Study70, can substantially increase sample sizes in genetic and other omic studies to help ensure that advances in precision medicine are realized in all populations.MethodsEthicsEthics statements for all studies contributing to the meta-analysis are given in Supplementary Table 1. The CCHC portion of this study was approved by the Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects of the University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston. Our study met all relevant regulations regarding the use of human study participants and was conducted in accordance with the criteria set by the Declaration of Helsinki. All study participants gave informed consent.Genome-wide association study dataThe T2D meta-analysis comprised 23,541 T2D cases and 37,434 controls from 16 contributing studies7,9,27,28,71–86 and the lipid (HDL-C, LDL-C, TC, and TG) meta-analyses included up to 63,184 samples from 19 contributing studies87–89 (Supplementary Data 1). All participants in the contributing studies self-identify as Hispanic and/or Latino. Sex was self-reported and confirmed to match gender through genetic data. Study-specific T2D and lipid phenotype measures, definitions, and exclusions are provided in Supplementary Data 1. Individuals that reported use of lipid-lowering medication were either excluded or lipid concentrations were adjusted to account for medication use (Supplementary Data 1).Contributing study quality control and imputationFor each study, genome-wide array data were cleaned and imputed to 1000 Genomes Project (1KG) phase 1 or 3 reference data using Minimac3 or IMPUTE290–94. Study-specific array, quality control, and imputation details are given in Supplementary Data 2. For the Million Veteran Program data, GWAS results were obtained from dbGaP, accession number phs001672 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs001672.v12.p1], and additional details of quality control and analysis methods can be found in the original manuscripts7,9. Additional details are provided in Supplementary Data 2.Single variant analysis and study-level quality controlT2D association analyses for each contributing study were performed via logistic regression or linear mixed model in SNPTEST95, EPACTS/EMMAX96, SOLAR97, GENESIS98, PLINK99, or R100. All models were adjusted for age, sex, and any necessary study-specific covariates (e.g., study location or batch). All studies either adjusted for principal components and/or used a mixed model to control for population substructure. All studies also either excluded closely related individuals or used a mixed model to control for close relatedness.Association testing for the four lipid phenotypes (HDL-C, LDL-C, TC, and log-transformed TG) were conducted via linear regression in SNPTEST95, EPACTS/EMMAX96, SOLAR97, GENESIS98, PLINK99, or R100. Residual lipid values were calculated, adjusting for age, sex, and any necessary study-specific covariates (e.g., study location or batch). The residual values were inverse rank normal transformed Relatedness and population substructure were controlled for as above. Study-level quality control included removal of low-quality variants (Minimac3 r2 < 0.3 or IMPUTE2 info <0.4), low-frequency variants (minor allele count (MAC) < 14 for T2D, MAC < 6 for lipids), duplicates, variants with large MAF discrepancy with AMR (absolute value of difference > 0.2), and variants where alleles did not match the AMR reference alleles.Single variant meta-analysisMeta-analyses were performed using MR-MEGA, which uses a meta-regression approach to model the effect of axes of genetic variation, representing study-level differences in genetic ancestry, allowing for partitioning of heterogeneity into effects correlated with ancestry differences and any remaining heterogeneity101. We included two measures of study-level mean allele frequency differences in our meta-regression, allowing for two axes of genetic variation. Two axes of variation were selected to capture major source of admixture within Hispanic/Latino populations (AMR, EUR, and AFR). For T2D, we performed an additional meta-analysis adjusting for BMI to explore if effects at our top findings are modified by BMI. Variants with MAC < 100 in the total meta-analysis sample were excluded. Single variant tests used a genome-wide significance threshold of p < 5 × 10−8. Sentinel variants, or variants with the lowest p-value, were identified for each region (1 Mb in either direction) with p < 5 × 10−8 and annotated using ANNOVAR102 and Open Targets Genetics103,104.Fine-mappingFine-mapping was performed using the method described in Magi et al., including all variants within one Mb of our sentinel variant for each region101. Briefly, we calculated a posterior probability of driving the association at a locus for each variant, then selected variants by Bayes’ factor, in descending order, summing the cumulative posterior probability until it met or exceeded 95%. The resulting 95% credible sets were queried for previously reported variants, or any variants in the NHGRI-EBI GWAS catalog within one Mb of our sentinel variant associated with the same trait105. A known signal was defined as a locus with known variants contained in its 95% credible set(s). A novel signal was a variant with no known variants within one Mb or contained in its 95% credible set(s). We defined a novel signal in a known locus as a locus that had known variants within one Mb, but no known variants contained in its 95% credible set(s).Replication of single variant novel signalsThe T2D meta-analyses were a part of a larger multi-ancestry meta-analysis effort by the DIAMANTE Consortium20. Five groups were assembled, including our Hispanic/Latino group, an African ancestry group (MEDIA), an East Asian ancestry group (AGEN-T2D)25, a European ancestry group (DIAGRAM)26, a South Asian ancestry group (SA-T2D)106, and the multi-ancestry meta-analysis of these five groups24. We queried our top novel T2D results for replication using summary statistics from the European, East Asian, and South Asian ancestry groups. For lipid traits, we queried publicly available results from the European- and African-ancestry subgroups of the Million Veteran Program (MVP) GWAS7 for each trait to assess for replication (the MVP Hispanic subgroup was included in our meta-regression).Development of pancreatic islet cell prediction modelsBecause pancreatic islet cells are a central tissue in T2D pathophysiology and exhibit a tissue-specific expression profile (e.g., 40–73% of islet eQTLs replicate in GTEx), especially at T2D-relevant genes such as INS23, in addition to leveraging extant GTEx prediction models107,108 we constructed models from extant pancreatic islet RNA sequence and associated genomic data23. The InsPIRE consortium was formed to aggregate human islet RNA-Seq data and genetic data to identify eQTLs and characterize genetic regulation of gene expression in a tissue central to T2D pathogenesis23. Here, we leveraged a subset 254 participants of the InsPIRE dataset that were made available to us upon request. Given that samples collected in the US were all described as Caucasian and the remainder of sampling occurred in Europe (Geneva, Edmonton, and Oxford) we expect the proportion of the islet sample that is of Hispanic/Latino ethnicity is minimal.For each gene, we trained in silico models of gene expression in pancreatic islet cells using genetic variants as features. Consider n samples with covariate-adjusted gene expression levels y1, y2, …, yn. For covariates, we used sex, the first four principal components (PCs) derived from the genotype data, and the first 30 PCs for expression. Each gene model used elastic net regularization, solving the following optimization problem:1\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\hat{{{\\mathbf{\\beta }}}}={{\\arg }}{\\min }_{{{\\mathbf{\\beta }}}\\,}(1/2){\\sum }_{i=1}^{n}{\\left( \\, {y}_{i}-{x}_{i}^{T}{{\\mathbf{\\beta }}}\\right)}^{2}+\\lambda \\left(\\left(\\frac{1-\\alpha }{2}\\right){\\Vert {{\\mathbf{\\beta }}}\\Vert }_{2}^{2}+\\alpha {\\Vert {{\\mathbf{\\beta }}}\\Vert }_{1}\\right).$$\\end{document}β^=argminβ(1/2)∑i=1nyi−xiTβ2+λ1−α2∥β∥22+α∥β∥1.The regularization term includes an L1 penalty on the effect-size vector β (enforcing sparsity) and an L2 penalty (promoting grouping effect). The parameter α = 0.5 determines the relative weights of the two penalties. This approach closely follows the conventional PrediXcan implementation107.Functionally oriented meta-analysisTo examine the final meta-regression results in a functionally oriented context, S-PrediXcan was used to determine association of each phenotype with genetically regulated gene expression (GReX) levels109. Using publicly available Joint-Tissue Imputation models for 49 tissues developed in the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project v8 data108 and our pancreatic islet cell models, we inferred tissue-specific GReX association with phenotype from our meta-GWAS summary statistics from MR-MEGA. As recommended by the S-PrediXcan authors, we applied this approach across all tissues, agnostic of currently known trait biology, as they found that generally accepted disease-relevant tissues are not typically enriched for GReX associations and, thus, a tissue-agnostic approach improves discovery109. We used a Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment across all tissues, genes, and phenotypes to account for multiple testing, as a Bonferroni correction for all tissues and traits would be too conservative due to correlation of both the expression models between tissues and the set of phenotypes tested. We considered an adjusted p < 0.01 to be significant.Mendelian randomizationWe assessed evidence of causality for genes identified in S-PrediXcan analyses and found to be significant after study-wide multiple test correction. The GTEx v8 tissue-specific eQTLs of target genes were used as instrumental variables for MR. We performed LD clumping to select eligible instrumental variables in each tissue separately with the LD panels from the 1000 Genome Admixed Americans (AMR), and the bigsnpr R package110,111. We used the median weighted MR method from the MendelianRandomization R package112, which offers unbiased and reliable estimation even when half of instrumental variables violate the assumptions of MR and in the presence of genetic pleiotropy112,113.LD scoresLD scores for variants in meta-analysis results were created using HCHS/SOL genotype data and GCTA v1.93.2, with an LD window size of 1 Mb and an LD r2 cut-off of 0.01114. eQTL effects were obtained from GTEx v8 eQTL Tissue-Specific All SNP Gene Associations data (https://www.gtexportal.org/home/datasets) and filtered to retain variants within 1 Mb of the gene.Measured transcriptomic expression analysesTo better understand molecular signatures associated with T2D and lipids for study-wide significant functionally oriented S-PrediXcan results, we directly measured whole blood gene expression in 884 (for T2D) and 696 (for lipid measures) Mexican-American individuals from the Cameron County Hispanic Cohort (CCHC) and performed association analyses between gene expression level and phenotype for each novel S-PrediXcan hit115. RNA sequencing was conducted using 150 bp paired-end reads on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 by Vanderbilt Technologies for Advanced Genomics. Initial sequencing quality was checked by FastQC116. STAR-2.7.8a was applied to align sequencing reads to the human genome reference (UCSC, hg38)117, and the aligned reads were assigned to genes using featureCounts in the Rsubread package118. We excluded samples with less than 15 M total aligned reads or a rate of successful alignment of less than 20%. The sequencing library size was normalized using DESeq2119. Individuals taking lipid-lowering medication were excluded, and triglyceride concentrations were log-transformed. We then tested for association of gene expression of the novel genes implicated in our S-PrediXcan analyses with trait, using linear regression, with RNA expression as the dependent variable and trait as the independent variable, and adjusting for age, sex, estimated cell type proportions (including granulocytes, CD19 + B cells, CD4 T lymphocytes, CD8 T lymphocytes, and CD14+ monocytes), three genetic PCs to capture population substructure, and ten probabilistic estimation of expression residual (PEER) factors to capture hidden factors that explain variation in the expression data.Proteomic analysesTo further explore significant S-PrediXcan findings in measured proteomic data, we measured the Olink Explore 3072 panel on 528 stored plasma samples from 271 individuals in CCHC. Normalized Protein eXpression (NPX) was generated in the full dataset, which included multiple measures for many individuals. Our proteomic analyses restricted to one time point per individual and adjusted for age, sex, and five genetic principal components in logistic (T2D) or linear regression (lipids), using the phenotypes measured at the time of specimen collection. Triglycerides were log-transformed.Heritability analysesLinkage disequilibrium score regression (as implemented in LDSC120) was applied to estimate SNP-based heritability. Heritability was estimated based on the relationship between GWAS summary statistics and linkage disequilibrium. To account for admixture in our Hispanic/Latino populations, cov-LDSC121 was applied to calculate the linkage disequilibrium score and was adjusted for the top ten genetic PCs from PC-AiR98,122. In this study, the linkage disequilibrium score was calculated with all 1,274,124 genotyped SNPs in 10,050 unrelated individuals from HCHS/SOL; the maximum unrelated set was calculated in PRIMUS and defined as unrelated at ≥third degree123.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.Supplementary information\nSupplementary Information\nDescription of Additional Supplementary Information\nSupplementary Data 1\nSupplementary Data 2\nSupplementary Data 3\nSupplementary Data 4\nSupplementary Data 5\nSupplementary Data 6\nSupplementary Data 7\nSupplementary Data 8\nReporting summary\nTransparent Peer Review file\nSource data\nSource Data"}

Recent trials suggest oral anticoagulant (OAC) monotherapy as a safer alternative, but data remains limited. We conducted a meta-analysis to compare OAC monotherapy with DAT in this population.Methods:A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central Library to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared OAC monotherapy with DAT in patients with AF and stable CAD. A bivariate random-effects model was used to perform meta-analyses. Statistical analyses were conducted using R Software 4.4.1, with a significance level of P < 0.05. Heterogeneity was assessed using I2 statistics, and the quality of studies was evaluated using the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool.Results:Four RCTs with a total of 4123 patients (20.2% females) were included. The mean age of the participants was 74 years. The results showed a significant reduction in major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding (risk ratio [RR]: 0.52; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.34–0.80; P = 0.003) in the OAC monotherapy group compared to the DAT group. However, net adverse clinical events (NACE) (RR: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.45–1.01; P = 0.054), major ischemic events (RR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.62–1.53; P = 0.91) and all-cause mortality (RR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.49–1.83; P = 0.87) were comparable between the two groups.Conclusions:In patients with AF and stable CAD, OAC monotherapy reduced the risk of major bleeding, with no significant differences in NACE, major ischemic events, or all-cause mortality as compared to DAT.", "body": "HIGHLIGHTS\nStudy population and treatment groups: The meta-analysis included four randomized controlled trials with a total of 4123 patients, of whom 20.2% were female, and the mean age was 74 years. The study compared two treatment groups: patients receiving OAC monotherapy vs. those on dual-antithrombotic therapy (DAT), which includes a combination of oral anticoagulants and antiplatelet therapy.Reduction in major bleeding risk: OAC monotherapy demonstrated a significant reduction in the risk of major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding compared to DAT, with a relative risk reduction of 48% (RR: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.34–0.80; P = 0.003).Comparable efficacy in adverse events: No significant differences were observed between OAC monotherapy and DAT in terms of net adverse clinical events (NACE) (RR: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.45–1.01; P = 0.054), major ischemic events (RR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.62–1.53; P = 0.91), or all-cause mortality (RR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.49–1.83; P = 0.87).IntroductionAtrial fibrillation (AF), where the upper chambers of the heart (the atria) beat irregularly and out of sync with the lower chambers (the ventricles), is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and affects over 33 million people worldwide[1]. It is strongly linked to stroke, heart failure, and other cardiovascular conditions, including valvular heart disease[2]. Coronary artery disease (CAD), a condition where the blood vessels supplying the heart become narrowed or blocked due to plaque buildup, is also common in AF patients, affecting about 25%–35% of this group[3,4]. Managing AF in patients with CAD poses a therapeutic dilemma. The treatment for such patients traditionally involved a combination of anticoagulation (AC) and antiplatelet therapy. While AC is crucial for stroke prevention in AF, antiplatelet therapy is essential for preventing recurrent ischemic events in CAD. As a result, many patients receive DAT, combining anticoagulants and antiplatelets. However, this approach carries a significantly higher bleeding risk; studies indicate that adding a single antiplatelet therapy to an oral anticoagulant (OAC) increases bleeding risk by 20%–60%[3,4].Current guidelines recommend that after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG), dual-antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) along with OAC therapy should be administered for up to 1 week, followed by dual-antithrombotic therapy (DAT) comprising of a P2Y12 inhibitor and an OAC for up to 12 months[5]. However, there is no strong consensus on long-term management beyond the high-risk period for patients who are stable and at low risk for ischemic events. Most recently, the EPIC-CAD trial was published that suggests dabigatran, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, or apixaban (DOAC) monotherapy as a safe alternative to DAT, showing comparable effectiveness while significantly reducing bleeding risks[6]. The 2023 ACC guidelines specifically endorse DOAC monotherapy 1 year after PCI for patients with non-valvular AF. In such cases, the ACC guidelines suggest that discontinuing antiplatelet therapy and continuing DOAC monotherapy may be reasonable. This recommendation, however, is rated as Class IIb, indicating a need for further evidence[7].Therefore, the goal of this meta-analysis is to pool all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted to date comparing OAC monotherapy to DAT in stable CAD patients with AF to help inform the latest evidence in the safety and efficacy of these regimens.MethodsLiterature review and search strategyThis systematic review and meta-analysis adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines and the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions[8]. The study protocol was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews. The review’s methodological quality was ensured by following assessing the methodological quality of systematic reviews guidelines, and the results are reported accordingly.Three extensive databases PubMed (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (via the Cochrane Library) were searched from their inception to September 2024 without any language restrictions using the following keywords: oral anticoagulant monotherapy, OAC, direct oral anticoagulants, DOAC, dual antithrombotic therapy, DAT, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease. Keywords and indexing terms were searched using a combination of Boolean operators, proximity operators, and truncation to ensure comprehensive coverage. Additionally, references of relevant studies were also manually searched to identify any potential studies. Complete search strategy is given in the Supplementary file, http://links.lww.com/MS9/A717.Eligibility criteria and outcomesThe inclusion criteria for studies in this meta-analysis consisted of studies comparing in patients of AF and stable CAD (P) OAC monotherapy (I) vs. DAT (C). Only RCTs reporting any of the prespecified outcomes of interest were included. The exclusion criteria included studies other than RCTs such as observational studies, case reports, case series, commentaries, editorials, review articles and meta-analyses, and non-peer-reviewed articles. In addition, studies without a comparison group, those not reporting the outcomes of interest and those with overlapping populations were also excluded.The primary outcomes of interest included major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding, net adverse clinical events (NACE), major ischemic events, all-cause mortality, and cardiovascular deaths. Secondary outcomes assessed include any stroke, ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, and myocardial infarction (MI).NACE is a composite of death from any cause, MI, stroke, systemic embolism, unplanned urgent revascularization, and major bleeding or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding, as defined by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis[9]. Clinically significant bleeding is defined as bleeding that requires medical intervention, such as hospitalization or extended hospitalization, diagnostic tests, imaging, endoscopy, invasive procedures (eg, colonoscopy, cystoscopy, bronchoscopy), or treatments like nasal packing, coil embolization, inotropic therapy, surgery, or changes in AC or other treatments as advised by the patient’s physician. Major ischemic events are defined by death from MI, ischemic stroke, or systemic embolism.Study screening and data extractionTitles and abstracts identified through the literature search were imported into reference management software (EndNote X9, Clarivate Analytics) for duplicate removal. Two authors independently screened the titles and abstracts for eligibility, followed by a full-text review of the selected articles. Any discrepancies during the screening process were resolved by consensus, with the involvement of a third author when necessary. Additionally, a manual search of the reference lists of the included studies was conducted to identify any further relevant studies. Data from the eligible studies were extracted and cataloged independently by two reviewers using electronic spreadsheets specifically designed on Microsoft Excel (.xlsx format) for this meta-analysis. The data collected included the first author’s name, the year of publication, the number of participants, follow-up duration, mean age, sex of participants, inclusion criteria, and reported outcomes.Statistical analysisStatistical analyses were performed using R software version 4.4.1 with the “meta” package. Pooled risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for dichotomous outcomes, employing the DerSimonian and Laird random effects model to combine results from the included studies. Forest plots were created to visually display the findings. A P-value <0.05 was deemed statistically significant. Heterogeneity across studies was evaluated using the Cochran Q test and Higgins I2 test[10]; P-values <0.1 and I2 > 25% were considered significant for heterogeneity. Sensitivity analyses were conducted using a leave-one-out approach, systematically excluding one study at a time to assess its influence on the overall estimate and explore sources of potential heterogeneity.Quality assessmentStudy quality was independently assessed by two reviewers using the Revised Cochrane risk of bias (RoB-2) tool for RCTs[11]. Studies were scored as low risk of bias, high risk of bias, or some concerns depending on their biases in selection, performance, detection, attrition, and reporting. Any disagreements were resolved by consensus. Due to the limited number of studies (<10), it was not possible to evaluate publication bias.ResultsSearch results and study selectionThe electronic database search yielded 1922 articles, which were then filtered to remove duplicates (n = 215) and underwent initial screening based on titles and abstracts, resulting in 125 articles for further full-text review. The full-text review led to the exclusion of 75 articles due to observational study design, 25 due to being conference abstracts, 13 articles due to different interventions, 8 due to inadequate outcomes. Finally, four studies met our inclusion criteria, and were included in the meta-analysis[6,12–14]. The detailed steps of our literature search and study selection are given in the PRISMA flow diagram (Fig. 1).\nFigure 1.PRISMA flow diagram of the included studies. (From: Page et al[8].)\nStudy characteristicsOur meta-analysis included four RCTs with a total of 4123 patients, out of which 20.2% were female. The mean age of the patients was 74 years, with a range from 60 to 90 years across the studies. Two studies used Edoxaban for the OAC monotherapy group, one study used Rivaroxaban, while one study used either warfarin or DOAC. The CHA2DS2-VASc score ranged from 4 to 4.6, and approximately 14% of patients had a previous history of stroke. The baseline demographics and clinical characteristics of the included studies are summarized in Table 1.\nTable 1Baseline characteristics of the included trialsTrial nameYearCountryMean Age in years (SD), intervention/controlNo. of patients, nFemale sex, %Previous Stroke, %CHA2DS2-VASc score, Intervention/ControlIntervention groupControl groupFollow-upAFIRE2019Japan74.3 (8.3)/74.4 (8.2)22152114.54(median) /4 (median)RivaroxabanRivaroxaban + APT24.1 months (median)OAC-ALONE2019Japan74.9 (0.4)/75.2 (0.4)69014.814.94.6 (1.4)/4.6 (1.4)Warfarin or DOACsOAC + APT24 monthsEPIC CAD2024South Korea71.7 (8)/72.5 (8.4)104022.9N/A4.3 (1.6)/4.4 (1.5)EdoxabanEdoxaban + APT12 monthsPRAEDO AF2022Japan74 (7)/74 (9)14713.614.34 (median)/4 (median)EdoxabanEdoxaban + APT (clopidogrel)624 days (median)SD, standard deviation; CHA2DS2-VASc, congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥75 (doubled), diabetes, stroke (doubled), vascular disease, age 65–74 and sex category (female); DOAC, direct oral anti-coagulant; OAC, oral anti-coagulant; APT, antiplatelet therapy.\nOutcomes and heterogeneity assessmentPrimary outcomesMajor or clinically relevant nonmajor bleedingThe risk of major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding was significantly lower in the OAC monotherapy group compared to the DAT group (RR: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.34–0.80; P = 0.003; Fig. 2). High heterogeneity (I2 = 58%) was noted, which was reduced to zero after excluding EPIC-CAD[6] (Supplementary Fig. 1, http://links.lww.com/MS9/A717).\nFigure 2.Forest plots of studies comparing OAC monotherapy with DAT in terms of major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding.\nNACEThe incidence of NACEs was similar between patients receiving OAC monotherapy and those receiving DAT (RR: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.45–1.01; P = 0.054; Fig. 3A). High heterogeneity (I2 = 76%) was observed between studies, and it did not decrease significantly after performing a leave-one-out analysis (Supplementary Fig. 2, http://links.lww.com/MS9/A717).Figure 3.Forest plots of studies comparing OAC monotherapy with DAT in terms of (A) net adverse clinical events (NACE), (C) major ischemic events, (A) all-cause mortality, and (B) cardiovascular death.\nMajor ischemic eventsThe outcome of major ischemic events was nonsignificant between the OAC monotherapy and DAT groups (RR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.62–1.53; P = 0.912; Fig. 3B). High heterogeneity (I2 = 61%) was present, which dropped to zero upon excluding either AFIRE[13] or OAC-ALONE[12] (Supplementary Fig. 3, http://links.lww.com/MS9/A717).All-cause mortalityAll-cause mortality rates were comparable between the OAC monotherapy and DAT treatment arms (RR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.49–1.83; P = 0.867; Fig. 3C). High heterogeneity (I2 = 68%) was observed, which reduced to zero after excluding AFIRE trial[13] (Supplementary Fig. 3C, http://links.lww.com/MS9/A717).Cardiovascular deathThe risk of cardiovascular death was similar between the two groups (RR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.52–1.45; P = 0.590; Fig. 3D). Moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 25%) was observed, which dropped to zero when either the AFIRE[13] or OAC-ALONE[12] trials were excluded (Supplementary Fig. 5, http://links.lww.com/MS9/A717).\nSecondary outcomesThe secondary outcomes assessed included any stroke, ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, and MI. When comparing the oral monotherapy group with the DAPT group, the outcome of any stroke yielded nonsignificant results (RR: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.47–1.13; P = 0.163; Fig. 4A), with a low heterogeneity (I2 = 16%). Similarly, the incidence of ischemic stroke was comparable between the two groups (RR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.57–1.36; P = 0.573; Fig. 4B) showing no heterogeneity (I2 = 0%). The incidence of hemorrhagic stroke also demonstrated nonsignificant differences between the groups (RR: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.23–1.21; P = 0.129; Fig. 4C) with no heterogeneity (I2 = 0%). Finally, the analysis of MI showed no significant difference between the groups (RR: 1.57; 95% CI: 0.79–3.12; P = 0.201; Fig. 4D) with no heterogeneity (I = 0%).\nFigure 4.Forest plots of studies comparing OAC monotherapy with DAT in terms of (A) any stroke, (B) ischemic stroke, (C) hemorrhagic stroke, and (D) myocardial infarction (MI).\nQuality assessmentTwo of the RCTs (AFIRE and EPIC-CAD) had an overall low risk of bias[6,13], while the OAC-ALONE had some concerns in terms of quality assessment due to the deviations from the intended interventions[12]. PRAEDO-AF trial is a high-risk trial due to concerns regarding the concealment of allocation sequence and unavailability of data regarding blind adjudication[14] (Supplementary Fig. 6, http://links.lww.com/MS9/A717).DiscussionOur systematic review and meta-analysis gather evidence from all four RCTs published to date, including the most recent EPIC-CAD trial on this topic, and strongly suggests that OAC monotherapy in patients with stable CAD and AF is a safe strategy with reduced bleeding risk and equivalent reduction in MACE as compared to DAT. The management of antithrombotic therapy in this patient population remains challenging and an area of ongoing research is to find a balanced regimen that provides optimal reduction in major ischemic events while decreasing the bleeding risk. Our meta-analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding in the OAC monotherapy group compared to the DAT group. While the other primary outcomes including NACE, major ischemic events, and all-cause mortality were found to be statistically insignificant between the two groups suggesting OAC monotherapy is non-inferior to DAT.Our meta-analysis expands on previous findings from the meta-analysis by Ahmed et al.[15], incorporating additional outcomes including NACE, major ischemic events, cardiovascular death, ischemic stroke, and hemorrhagic stroke as well as a crucial 4th RCT, PRAEDO-AF[14], missed in the last meta-analysis, highlighting its potential methodological limitations, inadequate screening process, and limited outcomes measures.American College of Cardiology 2023 guidelines give a Level 2 recommendation for OAC monotherapy in patients with stable CAF and AF[5,7]. The increasing amount of evidence from these RCTs and our meta-analysis underscore the need to revisit these guidelines and potentially increase the level of recommendation in favor of OAC monotherapy. Notably, this benefit of OAC monotherapy is observed in RCTs across different DOACs and warfarin and may not be restricted to a specific anticoagulant choice. It is also noteworthy that this benefit is noted across the spectrum of stable CAD including those without prior revascularization and those with revascularization with PCI or CABG more than 12 months ago. The omission of antiplatelet therapy after 12 months did not lead to higher incidence of acute MIs[6,12–14]. It is also to be noted that all trials except OAC-ALONE demonstrated no difference in stent thrombosis between OAC monotherapy and DAT groups[12]. Despite this, Antiplatelet therapy is still continued in common clinical practice along with OAC in these patients[16].Substantial heterogeneity (>50%) was observed in most primary outcomes, except cardiovascular death (I2 = 25%). Sensitivity analyses revealed that excluding AFIRE and OAC-ALONE significantly reduced heterogeneity in the majority of primary outcomes. Notably, removing EPIC-CAD eliminated heterogeneity in major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding from an I2 value of 58%–0%[6]. The high heterogeneity associated with AFIRE and EPIC-CAD may be attributed to their premature termination and, in AFIRE’s case, the use of non-standard rivaroxaban dosing[13]. In addition to this, included trials lacked clinical and methodological homogeneity. Two out of four trials used edoxaban[6,14], one used rivaroxaban[13], and one used either warfarin or direct OACs as the intervention[12]. Meanwhile, the antiplatelet drug in the control group was clopidogrel in the PRAEDO-AF trial[14], while it was either aspirin or a P2Y12 inhibitor in the remaining three trials[6,12,13]. All trials used standard doses of OACs that is, 60 mg once daily for edoxaban and 15 or 10 mg once daily for rivaroxaban, except AFIRE which used nonstandard dose of rivaroxaban that is 10–15 mg once daily[13].Our meta-analysis combines results from all the RCTs published on this topic and contributes to the expanding literature that antithrombotic regimen can be simplified to OAC monotherapy in stable CAD and AF patients that leads to a lower bleeding risk. However, while pursuing this strategy individual patient risk factors such as overall bleeding risk, co-morbids, and complexity of coronary anatomy including that of coronary intervention must be taken into consideration for each patient and decisions should then be made accordingly including the choice of OAC.LimitationsThere are a few limitations that underscore the need for future research on this topic. While the benefit of OAC monotherapy appears to be a generalized class effect of AC therapy, the relative comparison of efficacy and safety of individual DOACs cannot be derived from these RCTs and our meta-analysis and can be a target for future research. The existing trials, including EPIC-CAD, lacked sufficient sample sizes to detect significant differences in ischemic events and mortality. Furthermore, two of the four RCTs compared edoxaban monotherapy with DAT and therefore edoxaban appears to have the most robust evidence in comparison to DAT. Similarly, none of the trials exclusively included apixaban and therefore evidence of apixaban monotherapy compared to DAT is scant and requires future investigation. The premature termination of AFIRE and OAC-ALONE trials may have contributed to OAC-ALONE’s inability to demonstrate non-inferiority of OAC monotherapy vs. DAT. This early termination also raises concerns about the generalizability of both trials’ results to real-world clinical settings. Females are underrepresented in these RCTs and overall constitute only 20.2% of total patients included in our meta-analysis. The use of gastric protective medications such as proton pump inhibitors influence rates of bleeding and is especially recommended in patients with DAT and are not reported in studies other than EPIC-CAD. Existing trials, including EPIC-CAD, were not designed to detect significant differences in clinically relevant ischemic events and mortality. Our meta-analysis findings have limited generalizability due to a predominantly Asian population in all four RCTs. Ethnic differences in ischemic and bleeding risks between Asian and Western populations underscore the need for additional research in Western populations to confirm our results. Therefore, future studies with diverse ethnic representation are warranted. Lastly, our search did not include Google Scholar or Scopus. Google Scholar was excluded due to its grey literature, which can affect study quality, while Scopus was not used as it overlaps significantly with Embase, offering limited added value. Future studies may consider including these databases for a more exhaustive review.ConclusionIn conclusion, our meta-analysis suggests that OAC monotherapy offers an equally efficacious and safer alternative to DAT in stable CAD patients while balancing the risk of ischemic events and reducing the risk of overall bleeding."}

This study aimed to assess the comparative cardiovascular effectiveness of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) across diverse ASCVD phenotypes.Methods and resultsWe conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials evaluating GLP-1 RAs or SGLT2is against placebo or standard care in ASCVD patients. Primary outcomes included MACE, defined as cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke. Risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using a random-effects model.Twenty-six trials (151 789 patients) were included. Both GLP-1 RAs and SGLT2is significantly reduced MACE rates in ASCVD patients (RR 0.85; 95% CI 0.80–0.91 for both). GLP-1 RAs showed significant effectiveness in peripheral artery disease (RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.76–0.98) and post-acute cardiovascular events (RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.83–0.97). In ASCVD with heart failure, both drug classes reduced MACE (GLP-1 RAs: RR 0.73; 95% CI 0.63–0.84; SGLT2is: RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.78–0.95). SGLT2is significantly reduced MACE in ASCVD with chronic kidney disease (RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.72–0.99), particularly in severe albuminuria (RR 0.61; 95% CI 0.37–0.99).ConclusionGLP-1 RAs and SGLT2is exhibit distinct cardiovascular effectiveness profiles across ASCVD phenotypes. GLP-1 RAs show particular benefits in peripheral artery disease and post-acute cardiovascular events, while SGLT2is demonstrate unique advantages in ASCVD with comorbid chronic kidney disease. Both are effective in heart failure. These findings support tailored treatment strategies for diverse ASCVD participants based on specific comorbidities and risk factors.", "body": "IntroductionAtherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) encompasses conditions characterized by arterial narrowing, including coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease, ischaemic stroke, and acute myocardial infarction.1,2 As a global health concern, ASCVD contributes to higher rates of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) compared to non-ASCVD participants.3 Its frequent coexistence with heart failure and chronic kidney disease creates diverse phenotypes, complicating clinical management.4,5Recent advancements in diabetes pharmacotherapy, particularly glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is), have shown promise in reducing MACE rates among ASCVD patients.6 Network meta-analyses have demonstrated that both drug classes reduce cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, with SGLT2is particularly effective in reducing hospitalization for heart failure and GLP-1 RAs in reducing stroke risk.7,8 Further studies have shown SGLT2is’ positive effects on kidney outcomes and GLP-1 RAs’ effectiveness in reducing MACE rates, hospitalization for heart failure, and kidney function deterioration.9,10Current treatment guidelines recommend tailoring diabetes medication based on patient comorbidities, suggesting both SGLT2is and GLP-1 RAs for ASCVD patients, with a preference for SGLT2is in those with chronic kidney disease or heart failure. In cases where SGLT2is are not tolerated in chronic kidney disease patients, GLP-1 RAs are suggested as an alternative.11 However, managing patients with distinct ASCVD phenotypes, particularly those with peripheral artery disease, acute cardiovascular events, coexisting heart failure, or chronic kidney disease, remains complex due to a lack of robust, evidence-based guidance.While randomized controlled trials provide valuable insights, their findings can vary in both direction and magnitude, leading to uncertainty in treatment effects. For instance, in patients with ASCVD and chronic kidney disease, one trial showed a neutral effect of GLP-1 RAs on MACE,12 while another demonstrated a significant reduction.13 Similarly, in this patient group, two trials reported a neutral effect of SGLT2 inhibitors,14,15 whereas another showed a reduction in MACE.16 With the emergence of more recent studies,17,18 these conflicting results underscore the need for a systematic review and meta-analysis to consolidate the evidence and clarify the overall treatment effects.According to the Cochrane Handbook, a systematic review is a comprehensive synthesis of existing research and may or may not include a meta-analysis. A meta-analysis specifically refers to the statistical combination of different studies’ results to derive pooled effects estimates.19 To address this knowledge gap and provide more precise treatment recommendations, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the comparative cardiovascular effectiveness of SGLT2is and GLP-1 RAs across diverse ASCVD phenotypes. We aim to provide clinicians with valuable insights for tailoring treatment strategies to meet the specific needs of patients with various ASCVD manifestations.MethodsData sources and search strategyWe searched Cochrane Library, Embase, and PubMed databases for articles published up to 13 April 2023, using terms for SGLT2is, GLP-1 RAs, DPP4is, and cardiovascular diseases. (Detailed search strategy is provided in Supplementary material online, Appendix Table 1.) DPP4i trials were included for comparison due to their neutral cardiovascular effects. Manual cross-referencing was also performed.Study selectionWe applied pre-specified inclusion criteria to ensure alignment with our research objectives. Eligible studies met the following criteria: (1) randomized controlled trial design; (2) comparison of SGLT2is, GLP-1 RAs, or DPP4is with placebo, standard care, or each other; (3) enrolment of patients with ASCVD; and (4) reporting of MACE as an outcome. ASCVD was defined as the presence of coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease, stroke, or a history of acute cardiovascular events (defined as acute ischaemic stroke or myocardial infarction in selected studies).For this study, MACE was considered as one of the following composite endpoints: (1) three-point MACE: cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal stroke, or non-fatal myocardial infarction; (2) four-point MACE: three-point MACE plus hospitalization for unstable angina; (3) cardiovascular mortality or hospitalization for heart failure; or (4) cardiovascular mortality, renal mortality, or progression of renal disease.We excluded study protocols, conference abstracts, animal studies, comment letters, and observational articles. No language restrictions were imposed.Data extraction and quality assessmentData for the meta-analysis were extracted from detailed results reported in the included randomized controlled trials, which provided comprehensive outcome data. Two independent reviewers (Y.-M.L. and J.-Y.W.) extracted key information from eligible studies, including study characteristics (e.g. trial name and publication year), patient demographics (e.g. sample size, age, and comorbidities), intervention details (e.g. dose and frequency), comparison group, and outcome definitions. Discrepancies were resolved through consensus, with a third author (C.-T.L.) arbitrating when necessary.The risk of bias in included randomized controlled trials was assessed independently by Y.-M.L. and J.-Y.W. using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool.20 This tool evaluates five domains: randomization process, deviations from intended interventions, missing outcome data, outcome measurement, and selection of reported results. Based on this assessment, studies were classified as having low, some concerns, or high risk of bias.Data synthesis and analysisMeta-analyses are conducted to increase statistical power by pooling results from multiple trials, enabling the detection of smaller effect sizes that may not be evident in individual trials. Our systemic review and meta-analysis adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines.21 The study protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42023493814) to ensure transparency and methodological rigour.Data analysis was performed using RevMan software (Version 5.4.1). We employed a random-effects model based on the Mantel–Haenszel method. Risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to quantify the association between interventions and MACE rates.Heterogeneity was assessed using I² statistics, with I² ≤ 25%, 25% < I² < 75%, and I² ≥ 75% indicating low, moderate, and high heterogeneity, respectively.22 We performed a one-by-one exclusion analysis to evaluate the impact of individual studies on our results. We conducted a subgroup sensitivity analysis based on these definitions to account for potential variations in MACE definitions across studies. Additionally, for patients with ASCVD and chronic kidney disease, we performed a separate subgroup analysis based on albuminuria stages (A1: <30 mg/g, A2: 30–299 mg/g, and A3: >300 mg/g) to assess their impact on outcomes in this specific patient participants. A meta-regression analysis was conducted to explore potential sources of heterogeneity.Sensitivity analysisTo strengthen our conclusions, we performed a network meta-analysis, combining both direct and indirect evidence from trials to offer a more comprehensive assessment of the relative effects of the interventions.Publication bias assessmentWe assessed potential publication bias by visually inspecting funnel plots for asymmetry in the distribution of study effects. Additionally, we conducted Egger's regression test to quantitatively evaluate the likelihood of publication bias in all major outcomes.Role of the funding sourceThis research received no external funding or financial support, ensuring independence in study design, data collection, analysis, interpretation, and manuscript preparation.ResultsCharacteristics of included trials and study ParticipantsOur literature search, as shown in Figure 1, identified 11 027 articles.

GLP-1 RA trials defined outcomes as three-point MACE (eight studies)12,13,30–33,36,37 or four-point MACE (two studies).34,35 SGLT2i trials specified outcomes as three-point MACE (five studies),14,15,17,39,40 cardiovascular mortality and hospitalization for heart failure (seven studies),41–47 cardiovascular death and hospitalization for unstable angina (one study),32 or a composite of cardiovascular mortality, renal death, or kidney disease progression (two studies).16,18 Kidney disease progression was defined as sustained estimated glomerular filtration rate decline ≥50% or end-stage kidney disease development.Most studies used placebo as control, with two comparing interventions to glimepiride,26,29 and one to insulin glargine.35Quality assessment of included studies\nSupplementary material online, Appendix Figures 1–3 present the risk of bias assessment. Most studies showed low risk of bias in randomization (25/32), deviations from intended interventions (28/32), and missing outcome data (28/32). For outcome measurement, 30/32 studies had low risk. In result selection, 28 studies had low risk, 3 had some concerns, and 1 had high risk. Overall, 18 studies were low risk, 11 had some concerns, and 3 were high risk.OutcomesMACE in ASCVD patients\n\nFigure 2\n shows both GLP-1 RAs and SGLT2is significantly reduced MACE rates in ASCVD patients.

SGLT2is (three studies, n = 3608) showed a non-significant trend: 13.5% vs. 15.6%, RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.74–1.06, P = 0.19, I² = 20%.Figure 3Forest plot: MACE risk in patients with peripheral artery disease treated with GLP-1 RAs or SGLT2is vs. placebo.

GLP-1 RAs significantly reduced risk.MACE in ASCVD patients with heart failureBoth drug classes reduced MACE rates in ASCVD patients with heart failure (Figure 5). GLP-1 RAs (two studies, n = 6208): 9.5% vs. 13.1%, RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.63–0.84, P < 0.001, I² = 0%. SGLT2is (five studies, n = 9383): 16.6% vs. 19.8%, RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.78–0.95, P = 0.002, I² = 14%.Figure 5Forest plot: MACE risk in ASCVD and heart failure patients treated with GLP-1 RAs or SGLT2is vs. placebo.

GLP-1 RAs (two studies, n = 4120) did not: RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.64–1.05, P = 0.12, I² = 52%.Figure 6Forest plot: MACE risk in ASCVD and chronic kidney disease patients treated with SGLT2is or GLP-1 RAs vs. placebo. SGLT2is significantly reduced risk; GLP-1 RAs showed no significant difference.Sensitivity and subgroup analysisOne-by-one exclusion analyses identified ELIXA, DAPA-CKD, and VERTIS CV trials as primary heterogeneity sources.27,34,39 Results remained consistent after removal (Supplementary material online, Appendix Tables 2–6). Figure 7 shows SGLT2is significantly reduced MACE risk in chronic kidney disease patients with albuminuria stage A3 (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.37–0.99, P = 0.05, I² = 69%), but not in stages A1 and A2 (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.63–1.06, P = 0.12, I² = 42%). Results were consistent across various MACE definitions (Supplementary material online, Appendix Table 7). The meta-regression results showed no statistically significant differences in the comparison between GLP-1 RAs and placebo concerning age (P = 0.10), diabetes (P = 0.56), or hypertension (P = 0.15). Similarly, in the comparison between SGLT2is and placebo, no statistically significant differences were observed for age (P = 0.68) or hypertension (P = 0.11). However, a statistically significant difference was found for diabetes in the SGLT2i group (P = 0.04, slope = 0.20). The results from the network meta-analysis were consistent with the findings from the direct comparisons. (Supplementary material online, Appendix Figures 4 and 5.)Figure 7Forest plot: subgroup analysis of MACE risk in ASCVD and chronic kidney disease patients treated with SGLT2is, stratified by albuminuria stages. Significant risk reduction in stage A3; no significant difference in stages A1 and A2.Publication biasThe funnel plot analysis revealed no noticeable asymmetry for primary outcomes. (Supplementary material online, Appendix Figures 6–11.) Furthermore, Egger's regression test did not indicate any significant evidence of publication bias across the major outcomes, with all p-values >0.05.DiscussionThis systemic review and meta-analysis provide robust evidence for the comparative cardiovascular effectiveness of GLP-1 RAs and SGLT2is across various ASCVD phenotypes. Both drug classes significantly reduce MACE rates in ASCVD patients, with comparable overall effectiveness (RR 0.85). However, subgroup and sensitivity analyses revealed important nuances in their effectiveness across different ASCVD participants.GLP-1 RAs and SGLT2is demonstrated effectiveness in different ASCVD participants. GLP-1 RAs showed particular effectiveness in reducing MACE rates among patients with peripheral artery disease and those with a history of acute cardiovascular events, possibly due to their anti-inflammatory effects and lipid metabolism modification in these patients with severe atherosclerosis.48 An animal study has shown that liraglutide treatment in ApoE-/- mice led to a significant reduction in aortic plaque area and complexity, suggesting a direct anti-atherogenic effect.49 Additionally, liraglutide has been found to suppress macrophage foam cell formation, further contributing to the reduction of atherosclerosis.50 These findings indicate that GLP-1 RAs may not only prevent atherosclerosis progression but potentially reverse existing plaques.SGLT2is, on the other hand, showed significant MACE reduction in ASCVD patients with concomitant heart failure or chronic kidney disease, especially those with severe albuminuria (stage A3). Their benefits are largely attributed to haemodynamic effects, including natriuresis, glucose elimination, and blood pressure reduction, which may lead to improved ventricular remodelling.51 Besides, SGLT2is may also contribute to atherosclerosis regression through indirect mechanisms. The randomized trial demonstrated that empagliflozin treatment was associated with a reduction in left ventricular mass index and improved diastolic function.52 These improvements in cardiac structure and function could lead to reduced mechanical stress on arterial walls, potentially facilitating plaque stabilization and regression. Moreover, the anti-inflammatory effects of SGLT2is, as evidenced by reductions in biomarkers such as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and interleukin-6,53 may create a more favourable environment for plaque regression.For patients with concurrent ASCVD and heart failure, both GLP-1 RAs and SGLT2is showed significant benefits. GLP-1 RAs may be particularly beneficial in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and ischaemic cardiomyopathy, while SGLT2is may reduce MACE by decreasing afterload and mitigating structural remodelling.54 These findings align with and extend current treatment guidelines, which suggest considering both drug classes for ASCVD patients, with a preference for SGLT2is in those with chronic kidney disease or heart failure.55 Our results provide additional granularity, supporting a nuanced approach to treatment selection based on specific ASCVD phenotypes, which may lead to more personalized and effective cardiovascular risk reduction strategies. The meta-regression analysis revealed a statistically significant positive slope for diabetes in the comparison between SGLT2is and placebo, indicating that diabetic patients have a higher cardiovascular risk and event rate. This result aligns with current guidelines, which recommend SGLT2is for reducing cardiovascular risk in patients with diabetes.Despite the strengths of this meta-analysis, several limitations should be acknowledged. First, the included studies varied in their definitions of MACE and follow-up durations, which may have introduced some heterogeneity. However, our sensitivity analyses demonstrated the robustness of our findings across different MACE definitions. Second, the number of studies for some subgroup analyses was limited, particularly for certain ASCVD phenotypes, which may have affected the statistical power of these analyses. Third, as with all meta-analyses, our study is subject to the limitations of the included trials, including potential publication bias and heterogeneity in study designs and participants. Therefore, we conducted funnel plots and Egger's tests to strengthen our results, both of which indicated no significant publication bias. Additionally, the variability of ASCVD risk factors across different studies contributed to heterogeneity in our results, and the lack of detailed information prevented us from conducting subgroup analyses based on the prevalence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidaemia, chronic kidney disease, and smoking status. To address this, we conducted a meta-regression analysis based on age, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension to further strengthen our conclusions. Fourth, the possibility that GLP-1 RAs could influence suicidality is reasonable, considering that GLP-1 receptors are found in the central nervous system, and GLP-1 RAs have been shown to penetrate the blood–brain barrier.56,57 Earlier studies have associated bariatric surgery and weight-loss medications with an increased risk of suicide and self-harm.58 A limitation of our study is the absence of data on additional outcomes such as suicidality, depression, and dementia. The randomized controlled trials included in our analysis did not provide relevant information on these outcomes, and further research is needed to explore the potential links between GLP-1 RAs, SGLT2is, and mental health.ConclusionsThis systemic review and meta-analysis demonstrate significant cardiovascular benefits of both GLP-1 RAs and SGLT2is across various ASCVD phenotypes. Our findings support a nuanced approach to treatment selection: GLP-1 RAs show potential value in peripheral artery disease and post-acute cardiovascular events, while SGLT2is offer advantages in ASCVD patients with chronic kidney disease, particularly those with high albuminuria. Both drug classes show notable effectiveness in patients with concurrent ASCVD and heart failure. Future research should focus on direct comparisons of these drug classes in specific ASCVD participants to further refine treatment strategies for these high-risk patients.Supplementary Materialpvae093_Supplemental_Files"}

Random‐effect model (DerSimonian–Laird method) was used to pool the risk ratios (RR), mean differences, and 95% confidence intervals (CI).ResultsA total of 10 studies comprising 4325 patients (2295 BEV, 2030 SEV) were included. In short‐term, cardiovascular (RR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.36–0.87) and all‐cause mortality (RR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.35–0.81) were lower in the BEV group. Risk of moderate to severe paravalvular leak (PVL) was lower among BEV patients in short‐term (RR: 0.28, 95% CI: 0.17–0.49) and long‐term (RR: 0.28, 95% CI: 0.1–0.79). A limited number of studies showed a greater risk of clinical valve thrombosis on BEV in midterm and long‐term. The need for permanent pacemaker implantation was lower in BEV at both short‐term (RR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.37–0.87), and midterm (RR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.64–0.94). The SEV group had a larger effective orifice area with lower mean transvalvular pressure gradient at all endpoints.ConclusionsBEV is associated with reduced risk of clinical outcomes in short‐term; however, most differences diminish in longer evaluations, except for moderate to severe PVL, which remains elevated for SEV.

Current guidelines do not provide clear recommendations on the optimal valve type [2, 3]. Previous meta‐analyses have shed some light on differences in outcomes of the two valve types [4, 5, 6, 7, 8], but their findings predominantly relied on observational studies, and long‐term outcomes were not available for comparison.To address these gaps, we conducted a systematic review and meta‐analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate differences in short‐term, midterm, and long‐term clinical outcomes and hemodynamic performance of BEV and SEV in patients undergoing TAVR.2Materials and MethodsThis study was conducted following the guidelines outlined in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA), as provided in Supporting Information S1: Table S1 [9]. The protocol of the study was registered in the International Prospective Register for Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) (identification number: CRD42024541236).2.1Literature Search StrategyArticles were identified through searches of Embase, PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Library from database inception to July 20, 2024. We also searched ClinicalTrials. gov for eligible published trials. Gray literature was searched using Google Scholar, with the first 100 links (sorted by relevance) evaluated against the inclusion criteria. No limitations were imposed in our searches. A meticulous hand search of the references in the included papers and relevant review articles was also conducted. Additionally, to ensure a comprehensive literature search, forward citation chaining was performed, which involved manually reviewing the literature that cited the included articles and relevant reviews in Scopus database. Search strategy of the databases are listed in Supporting Information S1: Table S2.2.2Study Selection and Eligibility CriteriaWe included RCTs comparing clinical and hemodynamic outcomes of available BEVs against available SEVs in patients with aortic stenosis who underwent TAVR. Studies were excluded if they were review articles, lacked RCT design, were conducted on animal models, compared TAVR against surgical aortic valve replacement, compared BEV or SEV against mechanical valves, did not have available full text or lacked substantial information regarding the safety and efficacy of valve types.The results of a systematic search were imported into the Rayyan web application [10]. Two reviewers (H.R. and S.M.N.) undertook an initial screening of titles and abstracts independently, with discrepancies being resolved by discussion with a third investigator (A.S.M.). For potentially relevant studies, full‐text was obtained and two investigators (S.P. and F.S.) independently assessed their eligibility. Disagreements about study inclusion were resolved by consensus with a third author (S.S.).2.3Risk of Bias and Quality AssessmentThe risk of bias for each study was assessed by two independent reviewers (P.B. and N.S.H.) using Cochrane risk‐of‐bias tool for randomized trials version 2 (RoB 2) [11]. Moreover, the quality of evidence for each outcome parameter was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) framework [12]. Agreement between the two observers was tested and disagreement was resolved by consensus.2.4Data ExtractionTwo reviewers (P.B. and N.S.M.) independently collected the data from the included studies and recorded it in a predesigned Excel spreadsheet. A third reviewer (K.T.) cross‐checked the extracted data to identify any discrepancies. The required information was extracted from each eligible study across short‐term (30 days), midterm (1 year), and long‐term (> 1 year) endpoints as provided in Supporting Information S1: Table S3.2.5Statistical AnalysesContinuous variables were reported as means ± standard deviation or median (interquartile range), while categorical data were presented as numbers. Using random‐effect models, we estimated the pooled risk ratios (RRs) for binary outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes with their 95% confidence interval (CI) using the Mantel–Haenszel method. A continuity correction of 0.5 was applied for studies without event in one of the valve groups. The heterogeneity was measured using Cochran Q and I2 statistics. In analyses where I2 > 50% was observed, sensitivity analyses were conducted by excluding each study one by one to test the robustness of the pooled estimates and to evaluate the effects of each selected study on the overall results of the meta‐analysis. Moreover, potential heterogeneity factors were explored for all analyses by prespecified subgroup analyses including low surgical risk patients, small aortic annulus patients, old generation SEV (CoreValve) or newer SEVs (Evolut, Acurate, or Portico), or SEV brand used. The subgroup analysis for BEV generations was hindered by the limited number of studies used the older generations [13]. p‐values were 2‐sided, and values < 0.05 were considered significant. All statistical analyses were conducted using R Programming language (R for Windows, version 4.1.3, Vienna, Austria) and R Studio version 1.1.463 (Posit PBC, Boston, MA, United States) utilizing the “dmetar” and “meta” statistical packages [14].3ResultsInitially, 11,227 studies were identified through our primary search. After removal of duplicates, 8809 studies were subjected to title and abstract screening. Subsequently, 328 studies were assessed for full‐text screening and eligibility, and 18 studies were included in our meta‐analysis (Figure 1). These studies, from 10 RCTs, comprised a total of 4325 patients undergoing TAVR (2295 BEV, 2030 SEV) [13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31].

The quality of evidence for most of the outcomes was rated as “moderate,” primarily due to the limited number of studies and the frequency of observed outcomes, as provided in Supporting Information S1: Table S5.3.1Clinical OutcomesAt short‐term follow‐up, BEV patients experienced a lower risk of all‐cause mortality compared to SEV (RR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.35–0.81, p‐value: 0.003) with no heterogeneity between studies (I2: 0%, Q: 5.4, p‐value: 0.49). The risk of all‐cause mortality became comparable between BEV and SEV at midterm (RR = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.66–1.20, p‐value: 0.43) and long‐term follow‐ups (RR = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.79–1.25, p‐value: 0.71), but with moderate (I2: 34%, Q: 9, p‐value: 0.17) and high heterogeneity (I2: 61%, Q: 5, p‐value: 0.07), respectively (Figures 2 and S3A). Sensitivity analysis demonstrated consistent results after excluding studies one‐by‐one at long term outcomes.FIGURE 2Comparison of balloon‐expandable valves with self‐expanding valves for all‐cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and stroke at short‐term, midterm, and long‐term. BEV, balloon‐expandable valve; CI, confidence interval; RR, risk ratio; SEV, self‐expanding valve.The risk of cardiovascular mortality was lower in the BEV group at short‐term follow‐up (RR = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.36–0.87, p‐value: 0.01) with no heterogeneity (I2: 0%, Q: 5.6, p‐value: 0.46). Nevertheless, this risk did not differ between BEV and SEV at midterm (RR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.59–1.29, p‐value: 0.49) and long‐term follow‐ups (RR = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.64–1.49, p‐value: 0.93), with low heterogeneity at midterm endpoint (I2: 22%, Q: 6.3, p‐value: 0.27), and high heterogeneity in log‐term (I2: 66%, Q: 5.8, p‐value: 0.05) (Figures 2 and S3B). These findings were robust after performing sensitivity analysis in long‐term outcomes.No significant difference for stroke was observed between BEV and SEV during short‐term (RR = 1.17, 95% CI = 0.68–2.02, p‐value: 0.57), midterm (RR = 1.25, 95% CI = 0.68–2.28, p‐value: 0.47), and long‐term (RR = 1.09, 95% CI = 0.77–1.54, p‐value: 0.61). The heterogeneity was moderate to low in short‐term (I2: 37%, Q: 9.5, p‐value: 0.14) and long‐term endpoints (I2: 0%, Q: 0.4, p‐value: 0.79). Yet, there was high heterogeneity between studies at midterm follow‐up (I2: 53%, Q: 21.8, p‐value: 0.04) (Figures 2 and S3C). In sensitivity analysis regarding midterm outcomes, the removal of no single study significantly changed the results. Furthermore, concerning stroke subtypes (disabling and nondisabling), the risk remained similar for both subgroups at all follow‐up intervals (Figure S4).Notably, BEV patients had a lower risk of permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI) compared to SEV at short‐term (RR = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.37–0.87, p‐value: 0.008) and midterm (RR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.64–0.94, p‐value: 0.01) follow‐ups. Nonetheless, this difference converged at long‐term follow‐up and became comparable between BEV and SEV (RR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.55–1.36, p‐value: 0.52). The heterogeneity between studies was low in midterm assessment (I2: 0%, Q: 4, p‐value: 0.53), however, the heterogeneity a short‐term (I2: 74%, Q: 19.3, p‐value: 0.001) and long‐term (I2: 64%, Q: 2.7, p‐value: 0.09) outcomes were reported high (Figures 3 and S5B). None of the sensitivity analysis substantially altered lower risk of PPI in BEV group in short‐term endpoints. BEV was associated with an increased risk of valve thrombosis compared to SEV in midterm (RR = 6.25, 95% CI = 1.41–27.75, p‐value: 0.01) and long‐term (RR = 5.43, 95% CI = 1.21–24.33, p‐value: 0.02), with low heterogeneity at both endpoints (I2: 0%, Q: 0.1, p‐value: 0.94, and I2: 0%, Q: 0.02, p‐value: 0.88) (Figures 4 and S6B).FIGURE 3Comparison of balloon‐expandable valves with self‐expanding valves for heart failure hospitalization, and permanent pacemaker implantation at short‐term, midterm, and long‐term.

The results of subgroup analysis based on the surgical risk of the patient, anatomical characteristics of the aortic annulus, and SEV brands and generations are presented in the Data S1.3.2Hemodynamic OutcomesThe results demonstrated a significantly larger effective orifice area (EOA) in the SEV group in short‐term (MD = 0.16, 95% CI: 0.07–0.25 cm2, p‐value < 0.001), midterm (MD = 0.26, 95% CI: 0.11–0.41 cm2, p‐value < 0.001), and long‐term evaluations (MD = 0.24, 95% CI: 0.17–0.32 cm2, p‐value < 0.001) (Figures 5A and S9A). The heterogeneity was low in long‐term evaluations (I2: 0%, Q: 0.7, p‐value: 0.4), but was high in short‐term (I2: 70%, Q: 17, p‐value: 0.004) and midterm (I2: 89%, Q: 37, p‐value < 0.001) follow‐ups. However, the leave‐one‐out analysis demonstrated that after the exclusion of Baumbach et al. study [30], the heterogeneity in short‐term outcome decreased considerably (I2: 19%, Q: 4.9, p‐value: 0.2). of note, by excluding Lanz et al. [18] or Makkar et al. [19] studies, the EOA became comparable between both groups in short‐term follow‐up (MD = 0.12, 95% CI: −0.01–0.26 cm2, and MD = 0.12, 95% CI: −0.01–0.26 cm2, respectively). The significantly higher EOA in the SEV group in midterm follow‐ups was consistent by excluding studies through sensitivity analysis.FIGURE 5Comparison of balloon‐expandable valves with self‐expanding valves for (A) effective orifice area (cm2) (B) and mean transvalvular pressure gradient (mmHg).

The heterogeneity was reported high in short‐term (I2: 82%, Q: 16, p‐value: 0.008) and midterm (I2: 92%, Q: 5, p‐value < 0.001) outcomes. But the heterogeneity was low in long‐term results (I2: 10%, Q: 2, p‐value: 0.32). None of the sensitivity analysis substantially altered the outcomes in short‐term and midterm.The risk of moderate to severe paravalvular leak (PVL) was significantly lower in the BEV group in short‐term (RR = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.17–0.49, p‐value < 0.001) and long‐term (RR = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.10–0.79, p‐value: 0.01) follow‐ups with low heterogeneity (I2: 0%, Q: 1.4, p‐value: 0.69; and I2: 0%, Q: 0.45, p‐value: 0.5, respectively). However, a comparable risk between the two groups was observed through midterm (RR = 0.41, 95% CI: 0.11–1.63, p‐value: 0.2) with high heterogeneity (I2: 65%, Q: 8, p‐value: 0.03) (Figures 6 and S9C). The sensitivity analysis unveiled a lower risk of moderate to severe PVL incidence in BEV cases through midterm follow‐up (RR = 0.27, 95% CI: 0.08–0.95) with lower heterogeneity (I2 = 61%) by excluding Hermann et al. study [31]. Concerning mild PVL, a comparable risk was demonstrated between the two groups in short‐term follow‐up (Figures 6 and S10), which was also consistent in the sensitivity analysis.FIGURE 6Comparison of balloon‐expandable valves with self‐expanding valves for mild and moderate–severe paravalvular leak. BEV, balloon‐expandable valve; CI, confidence interval; PVL, paravalvular leak; RR, risk ratio; SEV, self‐expanding valve.The results of the subgroup analysis, based on patient surgical risk, anatomical characteristics of the aortic annulus, and SEV brand and generations, are presented in the Data S1, along with the procedural characteristics results.4DiscussionThe evidence from currently available RCTs suggests the following outcomes: (1) In short‐term, the risk of all‐cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality was lower in the BEV group, but no difference was noted between the two treatment modalities in extended follow‐ups. (2) The risk of moderate to severe PVL was lower among BEV patients during both short‐term and long‐term endpoints. (3) SEV patients experienced reduced occurrences of clinical valve thrombosis in midterm and long‐term follow‐ups. (4) The need for PPI was lower in BEV patients in short‐term and midterm but not in long‐term follow‐ups. (5) The SEV group had a larger EOA as well as a lower mean transvalvular pressure gradient through all endpoints. (Graphical Abstract).4.1Clinical OutcomesThis study demonstrated that BEV patients had reduced risk of all‐cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality in the short‐term period despite the comparable results in extended evaluations. These findings updated the results of the previous meta‐analyses demonstrating better short‐term survival in BEV patients [6, 32]. The findings also align with the FRANCE‐TAVI registry, which indicated that SEV patients had a higher risk of mortality at the 3‐months endpoint [33]. The low heterogeneity in our analyses indicated that most of the included RCTs agreed on lower all‐cause and cardiovascular mortality in short‐term among BEV patients including the recent SMART trial [31]. The observed short‐term survival benefit in the BEV group can be attributed to the differences in the procedural characteristics between the two valve types like quicker deployment modes and reduced need for implantation of more than one valve per procedure. Larger RCTs are required to draw stronger conclusions as the rationale behind the better short‐term survival in the BEV group is still unclear.Our results suggest that the risk of stroke was comparable between the two treatment modalities through all follow‐up endpoints, which was in line with previous findings [5, 6]. Nevertheless, other reviews contradicted our outcomes by showing that the risk of stroke was lower in BEV patients in short‐term evaluations [7, 8]. Their results, however, were based on propensity score matched studies, which are prone to bias from confounders. Notably, the risk of clinical valve thrombosis was higher in the BEV group in our study in midterm and long‐term periods. These results are consistent with the evidence in BEV patients in PANTER trial compared to SEV patients in Evolut low risk trial [34, 35]. Moreover, subclinical valve thrombosis was reported to be higher in BEV patients in previous trials [36]. Nevertheless, only a limited number of studies evaluated the risk of valve thrombosis in BEV and SEV patients in our analyses. Previous articles demonstrated an association between valve thrombosis and future cerebrovascular events [37]. Some studies have found that oral anticoagulation therapy can be more effective than antiplatelet treatments in mitigating valve thrombosis progression, but the increased risk of bleeding may offset these benefits [37]. Further research is warranted to evaluate the risk of valve thrombosis between the two valve types and to assess the impact of anticoagulation therapy, especially in younger patients with lower surgical risk for improved durability.This study also demonstrated that the risk of PPI was lower in the BEV group both in short‐term and midterm evaluations like previous studies [5, 6, 8]. The differences between the outcomes may arise from the variations in the stent design, the optimal depth of valve implantation, and the radial force exerted on the conducting system tissue [7]. Interestingly, the risk of PPI was comparable between the two valve types in long‐term evaluations in our study. Despite the higher risk of conduction disturbances in SEV patients, nearly half of their conduction disturbances resolved over time without requirement of PPI, which may partly explain the comparable outcomes in longer follow‐ups [38]. Further research is required to assess the risk of PPI between the two treatment modalities in long‐term evaluations.4.2Hemodynamic OutcomesAnother major concern with the TAVR procedure is the relatively small postprocedural EOA and high transvalvular pressure gradient. Previous studies reported that SEV was associated with a larger postprocedural EOA and lower transvalvular gradient than BEV [4, 7]. The current meta‐analysis supported these findings. This advantage is likely due to the supra‐annular position of the SEV leaflets, compared with BEVs with an intra‐annular design, which allows for lower resistance to left ventricular outflow and gradients [7]. Notably, the supra‐annular position of SEV valves is crucial for better hemodynamic outcomes but is not the only factor. Previous meta‐analysis demonstrated that intra‐annular SEVs like Portico have better hemodynamic performance compared supra‐annular ones like Acurate [39]. Therefore, other factors like large cell area at the annulus section of the stent frame and the method of leaflet suturing to minimize tissue interface, should also be considered.Smaller EOA and higher mean transvalvular pressure gradient can negatively impact the patients' quality of life and accelerate valve degeneration [31]. However, the suboptimal hemodynamic performance in BEV group did not translate to worsened clinical outcomes in this study. Previous studies have demonstrated discordant results between catheterization and Doppler echocardiography in evaluating postprocedural transvalvular mean pressure gradients [28]. Doppler echocardiography often overestimates the mean transvalvular pressure gradients, especially in BEV patients [40] This calls into the need for further evaluations of postprocedural hemodynamic characteristics of TAVR valves especially using invasive methods.This study also showed that the risk of moderate to severe PVL was lower in the BEV group both in short‐term and long‐term endpoints. The increased risk of moderate to severe PVL with SEV can be attributed to the lower radial strength of the nitinol frame used in SEV alongside their higher eccentricity index and decreased expansion. Moderate to severe PVL may be associated with higher short‐term and long‐term mortality after TAVR in aortic stenosis patients [20]. Nevertheless, our results indicated that the risk of mortality was comparable between the two valves in midterm and long‐term. These findings reinforce the fact that other unknown risk factors may also be associated with mortality which remains to be studied. The main findings of previous meta‐analyses are presented in Supporting Information S1: Table S6.5LimitationsThere are some limitations that should be mentioned regarding the present systematic review and meta‐analysis. First, the included RCTs mostly lack sufficient power for evaluating some outcomes, leading to the loss of statistical significance in some subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Nevertheless, this meta‐analysis included more than twice as many RCTs as previous reports allowing for a more precise estimate of TAVR valve outcomes. More adequately powered RCTs are needed to compare the two TAVR modalities comprehensively. Second, despite conducting subgroup analyses, substantial heterogeneity persisted across some evaluations. This heterogeneity may be attributed to the varying characteristics of different SEV brands used in the studies. Only two RCTs employed SEVs other than CoreValve or Evolut [18, 19, 24, 29]. However, since only one BEV brand was compared against multiple iterations of SEVs from different manufacturers with various designs, the findings cannot be extrapolated to any specific SEV type. Additionally, the variations in design within the same SEV and BEV brands, as well as differences in diameters used for the included participants, could contribute to potential heterogeneity. However, due to the lack of patient‐level data, further analysis to account for these design differences was not possible. Third, tests for publication bias were not undertaken, as Egger's test and funnel plots are not suitable for analysis with fewer than 10 studies. Last, there were a limited number of RCTs evaluating the long‐term outcomes of TAVR. Further evaluations on long‐term outcomes of BEV and SEV are still required.6ConclusionIn the recent guidelines, TAVR has received a Class I, Level A recommendation for patients over 75‐years‐old patients and those considered high risk for surgery, with a strong emphasis on shared decision‐making between patients and the experts [2, 3]. The present meta‐analysis provided a comprehensive investigation to compare the outcome of two TAVR modalities. The results indicated that each valve type is associated with distinct advantages and disadvantages post‐TAVR. Therefore, the medical team should consider device characteristics besides the patient's condition to minimize the risk of complications.Ethics StatementThe authors have nothing to report.Conflicts of InterestThe authors declare no conflicts of interest.Supporting information\nFigure S1.

No entanto, ainda existem dúvidas sobre o impacto de metas intensivas de tratamento anti-hipertensivo (meta < 130/80 mmHg) em comparação com metas convencionais (≥ 130/80 mmHg) na prevenção de infarto do miocárdio, acidente vascular cerebral, mortalidade e possíveis eventos adversos do tratamento.Objetivo Avaliar a eficácia de metas intensivas de tratamento anti-hipertensivo na redução de eventos cardiovasculares críticos em comparação com metas usuais.Métodos Esta revisão sistemática incluiu ensaios clínicos randomizados (ECRs) que compararam metas intensivas de controle da pressão arterial com metas convencionais em adultos com 18 anos ou mais. Foram incluídos estudos com pelo menos um dos seguintes desfechos: mortalidade, infarto do miocárdio, acidente vascular cerebral, progressão para doença renal crônica em estágios IV ou V, necessidade de diálise ou transplante renal. As bases de dados Medline, Embase e Cochrane Library foram pesquisadas até maio de 2024.

O tratamento intensivo foi associado a uma redução de 13% nos eventos cardiovasculares. Nos estudos com baixo risco de viés, a redução foi de 17%, com alta certeza da evidência. Separadamente, observou-se uma redução significativa nos desfechos de infarto do miocárdio e acidente vascular cerebral, mas não na mortalidade por todas as causas. Dados limitados foram encontrados sobre a progressão da doença renal e necessidade de diálise ou transplante renal.Conclusão As evidências de alta qualidade sugerem que metas mais intensivas de tratamento anti-hipertensivo reduzem significativamente os eventos cardiovasculares. Contudo, a escolha das metas de tratamento deve ser individualizada, considerando fatores como idade, fragilidade, o risco cardiovascular individual e a possibilidade de eventos adversos. A adesão ao tratamento é fundamental para o sucesso terapêutico.", "body": "Recomendação 1: A Sociedade Brasileira de Cardiologia recomenda a estratégia de metas mais intensivas para o tratamento anti-hipertensivo (valores menores de 130/80 mmHg) para pacientes adultos hipertensos, com o objetivo de reduzir eventos cardiovasculares importantes (infarto do miocárdio, acidente vascular cerebral e morte). Esta é uma recomendação forte com uma alta certeza da evidência.Recomendação 2: A Sociedade Brasileira de Cardiologia recomenda a estratégia de metas mais intensivas para o tratamento anti-hipertensivo (valores menores de 130/80 mmHg) para pacientes hipertensos idosos (idade > 65 anos), com o objetivo de reduzir eventos cardiovasculares importantes futuros (infarto do miocárdio, acidente vascular cerebral e morte). Esta é uma recomendação forte com uma alta certeza da evidência. Esta recomendação deve ser avaliada de forma individualizada quando se tratar de um idoso frágil ou com expectativa de vida futura limitada.Recomendação 3: A Sociedade Brasileira de Cardiologia recomenda a estratégia de metas mais intensivas para o tratamento anti-hipertensivo (redução adicional de 5 mmHg) para pacientes hipertensos de alto risco cardiovascular que já estejam dentro da meta de tratamento intensivo (PAS < 130 mmHg), com o objetivo de redução adicional de eventos cardiovasculares importantes futuros (infarto do miocárdio, acidente vascular cerebral e morte). Esta é uma recomendação forte com uma alta certeza da evidência.IntroduçãoA hipertensão arterial (HA) é atualmente um importante desafio de saúde, que contribui substancialmente para as taxas de doenças cardiovasculares globalmente. Trata-se de um dos principais fatores de risco para morbidade e mortalidade, afetando mais de um bilhão de pessoas e sendo responsável por aproximadamente 9,4 milhões de mortes anuais.1 A HA não apenas aumenta o risco de complicações cardiovasculares, mas também impõe uma considerável carga econômica sobre os sistemas de saúde, especialmente em países de baixa e média renda.2 No Brasil, a HA também é um grande problema de saúde pública, que afeta aproximadamente um terço da população adulta.3 É responsável por uma proporção significativa de infartos e acidentes vasculares cerebrais, que são as principais causas de morte no país.4,5 A HA também exerce uma influência substancial sobre o Sistema Único de Saúde (SUS), resultando em aumento dos custos de saúde, considerável perda de dias de trabalho e aposentadoria precoce.6 Há uma necessidade crescente de intervenções eficazes de saúde pública voltadas para a prevenção, detecção precoce e manejo da doença.7 Enfrentar esse desafio é crucial para melhorar a saúde e reduzir os níveis de doenças crônicas no Brasil.O tratamento anti-hipertensivo desempenha papel crucial no manejo da doença e na redução do risco associado a eventos cardiovasculares, e normalmente envolve uma combinação de intervenções no estilo de vida com tratamentos farmacológicos.7 Atualmente, existe um debate a respeito das metas ideais a serem alcançadas na HA. As estratégias de controle intensivo, que visam metas mais baixas de pressão arterial (PA), mostraram uma redução significativa na incidência de eventos críticos em pacientes de alto risco em estudos clínicos como o SPRINT.8 No entanto, essa abordagem também traz um aumento potencial dos riscos de eventos adversos, como hipotensão, lesão renal aguda e desequilíbrios eletrolíticos, que podem levar a desfechos desfavoráveis, especialmente em pacientes idosos ou frágeis.9 Por outro lado, o tratamento convencional, que segue metas de PA mais moderadas, pode não proporcionar o mesmo nível de proteção cardiovascular e renal.8 Essa discussão ressalta a importância de tratamentos individualizados, que considerem o estado geral de saúde do paciente, além das comorbidades e a possibilidade de efeitos adversos relacionados ao tratamento.Com o objetivo de esclarecer a melhor estratégia em relação às metas de PA em pacientes hipertensos, considerando as melhores evidências científicas atuais, a Sociedade Brasileira de Cardiologia (SBC) desenvolveu uma Recomendação Clínica sobre o tema.MétodosPara a realização da Recomendação Clínica, foi realizada uma revisão sistemática. A pergunta de pesquisa estruturada no formato PICO (paciente/população, intervenção, comparação e desfecho) foi: Em pacientes hipertensos, qual é a diferença do tratamento farmacológico com metas mais intensivas de controle da PA (< 130/80 mmHg) comparadas a metas de controle habitual (≥ 130/80 mmHg), especificamente em relação a desfechos críticos e importantes, como morte, acidente vascular cerebral, infarto do miocárdio, progressão para insuficiência renal estágio 4 ou 5, necessidade de diálise ou transplante renal? O protocolo do estudo foi registrado na base de dados PROSPERO, sob o número CRD42024545853.A revisão sistemática rápida, metodologia empregada neste documento, pertence à família das revisões sistemáticas. Trata-se de uma ferramenta desenvolvida na última década com o objetivo de manter o rigor metodológico em busca das melhores evidências possíveis, porém com modificações que aceleram o tempo de execução. Geralmente, essas revisões informam sociedades médicas ou instituições de saúde sobre as melhores evidências disponíveis, com base em uma pergunta no formato PICO, de maneira sensível, transparente e sistemática. Instituições de destaque na área de metodologia descreveram os métodos para esse tipo de revisão sistemática.10-12Uma primeira busca por revisões sistemáticas sobre a pergunta PICO foi realizada em três bases de dados: Medline, Embase e a Biblioteca Cochrane. Os detalhes das estratégias de busca estão fornecidos no material suplementar (Tabela S1). Dois pesquisadores realizaram, de forma independente, a seleção dos estudos e a extração das características basais dos documentos definidos para leitura completa (Tabelas S2 e S3). No entanto, entre as revisões sistemáticas encontradas, que cobrem os anos de 2019 a 2024, nenhuma abordou exatamente a questão PICO de interesse, exceto pelo documento de Sakima et al.13 Esta publicação incluiu buscas por estudos até março de 2018, recuperando nove artigos que compararam a meta intensiva de PA (< 130/80 mmHg) com a meta usual e avaliaram eventos cardiovasculares como desfecho. A decisão dos autores foi atualizar a busca dessa revisão sistemática e realizar uma nova metanálise com os dados extraídos dos estudos primários.Uma segunda busca por ensaios clínicos randomizados (ECRs) foi realizada para a atualização do documento de referência escolhido, englobando o período de março de 2018 a maio de 2024 nas mesmas bases de dados que a primeira busca. Os detalhes das estratégias de busca estão fornecidos no material suplementar (Tabela 4S). Os artigos selecionados para a revisão de texto completo foram considerados para inclusão se atendessem aos seguintes critérios: (1) ser um ECR; (2) apresentar estimativas de risco para avaliar o impacto de metas intensivas de PA versus metas usuais de PA; (3) apresentar pelo menos um dos seguintes desfechos descrito numericamente: mortalidade por todas as causas, acidente vascular cerebral, infarto do miocárdio e progressão para insuficiência renal estágio 4 ou 5, necessidade de diálise ou transplante renal; (4) incluir pacientes com 18 anos ou mais. Não houve restrições de idioma na seleção dos estudos.Dois pesquisadores foram responsáveis pela seleção, extração e avaliação da qualidade de todos os artigos finais. A ferramenta RoB 2 (Risk of Bias 2) da Colaboração Cochrane foi utilizada para a avaliação do risco de viés.14 A força das recomendações e a certeza das evidências foram determinadas de acordo com a metodologia GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation)15 (Tabelas 2 e 3).Uma descrição detalhada da metodologia empregada nesta revisão sistemática pode ser encontrada no material suplementar. O viés de publicação não foi avaliado pela razão do número de estudos originais ser menor do que dez.As recomendações clínicas foram definidas de forma consensual em reunião de um Painel de Recomendação formado por profissionais indicados pela SBC. Foi considerado o limiar de 5% como uma diferença mínima importante para a intervenção ser considerada clinicamente relevante.\nTabela 2– Risco de viés dos estudos primários segundo a ferramenta RoB 2.0 da Colaboração CochraneEstudoIntervençãoComparadorDesfechoD1D2D3D4D5 SchrierTTO IntensivoTTO UsualEventos CV\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nESTACIOTTO IntensivoTTO UsualEventos CV\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCardioSisTTO IntensivoTTO UsualEventos CV\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAppelTTO IntensivoTTO UsualEventos CV\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACCORDTTO IntensivoTTO UsualEventos CV\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSPS3TTO IntensivoTTO UsualEventos CV\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSPRINTTTO IntensivoTTO UsualEventos CV\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOMED-BPTTO IntensivoTTO UsualEventos CV\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTEP - ZhangTTO IntensivoTTO UsualEventos CV\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n: Baixo Risco; : Moderado Risco; : Alto Risco.

Desses, um foi excluído por não apresentar os riscos relativos de interesse,16 e os oito restantes foram incluídos.8,17-23Como resultado da segunda busca na literatura, que teve como objetivo identificar novos ECRs publicados após março de 2018, foram inicialmente triadas 2.061 citações. Destas, apenas dois estudos foram selecionados para a revisão de texto completo, resultando na inclusão de um ECR adicional na metanálise atualizada,24 e na exclusão do segundo artigo por não ser um ECR original.25As principais características dos nove estudos primários incluídos nesta metanálise estão apresentadas na Tabela 1.

Houve uma redução de 13% nos eventos, favorecendo a estratégia de metas mais intensivas de tratamento anti-hipertensivo. Para o mesmo desfecho, quando apenas estudos com baixo risco de viés foram incluídos (Figura 2), observou-se uma redução de 17% nos eventos, também favorecendo a estratégia de metas mais intensivas de tratamento anti-hipertensivo. A certeza das evidências para essa análise foi classificada como alta, de acordo com a metodologia GRADE.\nFigura 1– Metanálise para o desfecho composto primário, definido como infarto do miocárdio, acidente vascular cerebral e mortalidade por todas as causas.Heterogeneidade: I2= 0%, t2 = 0,0013, p = 0,60\n\nFigura 2– Metanálise para o desfecho composto primário, definido como infarto do miocárdio, acidente vascular cerebral e mortalidade por todas as causas, avaliado apenas para os estudos com baixo risco de viés.Heterogeneidade: I2= 0%, t2 = 0,0005, p = 0,38\nQuando avaliados separadamente, esses três desfechos mostraram uma redução no infarto do miocárdio e no acidente vascular cerebral, favorecendo a estratégia de metas mais intensivas, sem diferença significativa observada para a mortalidade por todas as causas (Figura 1S).O desfecho de progressão da doença renal foi avaliado em quatro estudos incluídos, mas apenas dois forneceram dados numéricos. Devido ao baixo número de estudos e às diferenças nas definições de progressão renal, os autores não incluíram esse desfecho na avaliação primária e não realizaram uma metanálise para esse evento individual.Duas revisões sistemáticas adicionais avaliadas para leitura completa na primeira busca respondem perguntas PICO com pequenas diferenças em relação à pergunta científica original desta revisão. Ambas foram consideradas pelos autores como temas muito relevantes para o sistema de saúde e subsidiaram duas recomendações clínicas adicionais deste documento.26,27 Os dois documentos foram considerados de boa qualidade técnica pelos autores, tendo sido penalizados pela avaliação de qualidade AMSTAR 228 apenas em características que não comprometiam a informação central. A avaliação de qualidade pela ferramenta AMSTAR 2 destas duas revisões sistemáticas adicionais utilizadas para recomendações clínicas suplementares estão na Tabela 6S.A Tabela 7S descreve o PRISMA deste documento.DiscussãoA HA é um dos principais fatores de risco modificável para morte prematura. Portanto, determinar se metas mais intensivas de redução da PA oferecem benefícios adicionais para a redução de complicações cardiovasculares é de suma importância, alinhando-se à missão educativa da SBC. Esta revisão oferece uma resposta conclusiva para essa lacuna na prática clínica.Definir o valor-alvo para o tratamento anti-hipertensivo tem sido um desafio na literatura científica devido à variabilidade das metas propostas em diferentes estudos. Embora um ponto de corte de 120/80 mmHg possa ser considerado, ECRs que visaram esse alvo mais rigoroso, frequentemente enfrentaram dificuldades em atingir esses resultados. Por essa razão, nesta revisão sistemática, optou-se por incluir estudos nos quais o braço de intervenção visava uma PA abaixo de 130/80 mmHg, objetivo mais alcançável na prática clínica real.Na busca inicial da literatura, que teve como objetivo identificar revisões sistemáticas que abordassem a pergunta PICO predefinida, nenhum documento foi encontrado que pudesse fornecer uma resposta atualizada. Por isso, decidiu-se atualizar o artigo de Sakima et al.13Com base nos resultados demonstrados nesta revisão, que inclui dados de mais de 34.000 indivíduos, o benefício clínico de metas mais rigorosas de controle da PA para a população de pessoas com HA está bem estabelecido. No entanto, ainda havia incerteza se todos os espectros de risco cardiovascular se beneficiariam desse efeito. Entre os nove estudos incluídos, cinco — com mais de 6.000 pacientes — tinham uma idade média inferior a 60 anos e uma proporção significativa de mulheres (40% ou mais). Isso nos permite concluir que uma parte substancial desses participantes estava na categoria de baixo risco de eventos cardiovasculares (risco estimado < 7,5% para 10 anos). Por outro lado, os quatro estudos restantes, que incluíam pacientes em sua maioria homens com mais de 60 anos, representavam adequadamente o outro extremo de exposição, abrangendo pacientes com alto risco cardiovascular (risco estimado > 15% para 10 anos). Combinando esses dados, podemos supor que estes subgrupos estavam bem representados nos estudos que observaram um benefício importante em redução de eventos.Outra pergunta relevante que se coloca é se reduções adicionais para valores de 120/80 mmHg ou ainda mais baixos, particularmente em pacientes com maior risco cardiovascular e menor probabilidade de efeitos colaterais, poderiam resultar em benefícios clínicos adicionais (e valeria recomendar, se colocados em prática). Com base na metanálise de dados individuais da Blood Pressure Lowering Treatment Trialists’ Collaboration de 2021, para qualquer faixa inicial de PA (mesmo em indivíduos com valores sistólicos menores do que 120 mmHg), uma redução de 5 mmHg determina uma redução de 11% nos eventos cardiovasculares.27 Para esses indivíduos de alto risco, buscar as metas de controle rigoroso propostas pelos estudos SPRINT8 e ACCORD21 pode ser uma opção terapêutica vantajosa. Deve-se levar em consideração o risco de efeitos colaterais, número de medicamentos utilizados (adesão) e custos adicionais, contrapondo-se com a significativa redução de eventos cardiovasculares críticos. Esta revisão sistemática serviu de referência para a recomendação clínica de número três neste documento.Metas mais rigorosas de controle anti-hipertensivo sempre levantam preocupações sobre eventos adversos, especialmente em pacientes muito idosos ou frágeis. No entanto, uma metanálise recente envolvendo 20.895 indivíduos idosos demonstrou que a estratégia de metas intensivas de controle da PA resultou em uma redução de 29% nos principais eventos cardiovasculares, sem evidências de aumento de reações adversas graves ou piora da função renal.26 Esses achados reforçam ainda mais a ideia de implementar um controle mais rigoroso da HA para a população em geral, independentemente da idade. No entanto, essa recomendação não elimina a necessidade de se considerar as circunstâncias individuais de cada paciente e de se estabelecer metas menos intensivas para aqueles que são frágeis, têm expectativa de vida limitada ou possuem características que possam aumentar o risco de efeitos colaterais. Esta revisão sistemática serviu de referência para a recomendação clínica de número dois neste documento.Ainda sobre possíveis eventos adversos do tratamento anti-hipertensivo, existe a discussão sobre o fenômeno da curva J. Este se refere à observação de que tanto níveis excessivamente altos quanto excessivamente baixos de PA estão associados a um aumento do risco de complicações cardiovasculares, formando uma curva em forma de “J” quando plotada em um gráfico. Esse fenômeno é particularmente observado com a PA diastólica e sua associação com a doença arterial coronariana e outros eventos cardiovasculares. O conceito da relação em curva J entre a PA e desfechos cardiovasculares foi proposto pela primeira vez na década de 1970,29 e posteriormente verificado em vários estudos observacionais, como por exemplo o Estudo de Framingham.30 Baseado na mesma revisão sistemática realizada pelo grupo Blood Pressure Lowering Treatment Trialists’ Collaboration de 2021, reunindo 48 ECRs (que possuem uma certeza da evidência mais robusta do que estudos observacionais), quando avaliamos a população com doença cardiovascular prévia e reduções da PA sistólica além de 120 mmHg, não foi evidenciado um aumento de eventos cardiovasculares. Ao contrário, mesmo nesta população de muito alto risco e metas muito intensivas de redução da PA, foi observada também a diminuição dos desfechos primários, contradizendo a hipótese do fenômeno da curva J.Uma discussão relevante adicional é se o método de medida da PA poderia influenciar os resultados de efeito clínico observados. O estudo SPRINT utilizou um método que envolvia a realização de três aferições de PA durante uma visita ao consultório, com o paciente sentado, após um período de cinco minutos de repouso, utilizando um sistema de medida automatizada (Modelo 907, Omron Healthcare), sem a presença do médico ou outro profissional de saúde. Este procedimento foi criticado por diferir daqueles utilizados em outros estudos, levantando preocupações sobre a reprodutibilidade de seus resultados. No entanto, um estudo conduzido logo após o SPRINT demonstrou, por meio de entrevistas com os seus participantes, que essa técnica foi implementada em menos da metade dos pacientes, sem diferenças nos desfechos clínicos entre os grupos com base no método de mensuração da PA.31 Um segundo estudo comparou a técnica proposta no ensaio SPRINT com medidas de PA feitas sem repouso prévio. Os resultados mostraram uma variabilidade considerável na concordância entre os valores, sugerindo que a técnica do SPRINT poderia levar a leituras de PA mais baixas.32 No entanto, este foi um estudo observacional, conduzido em um único centro, e com um pequeno número de participantes. Essas críticas são importantes, mas não invalidam os resultados apresentados nesta metanálise. Destaca-se assim, uma das muitas vantagens a respeito da realização de uma revisão sistemática, que sumariza os resultados de vários estudos, minimizando a influência de um único artigo isolado no resultado final. Ao realizar uma análise de sensibilidade excluindo o estudo SPRINT, o benefício clínico da redução intensiva da PA permanece, mostrando uma redução de 11% nos eventos (Figura 2S).Recente revisão sistemática em processo de publicação avaliou pergunta PICO semelhante e chegou a resultados parecidos, corroborando as recomendações clínicas sugeridas neste documento da SBC.33 Whelton et al.33 observaram para a meta intensiva de controle da PA sistólica (< 130 mmhg) uma redução de 22% para um desfecho composto de acidente vascular cerebral, doença coronariana, insuficiência cardíaca e morte cardiovascular (hazard ratio [HR] = 0,78; intervalo de confiança [IC] de 95% =0,70 a 0,87; heterogeneidade: I2 = 64,5%; p = 0,01). Houve diferença estatística para o desfecho mortalidade geral (HR = 0,89; IC 95% =0,79 a 0,99; heterogeneidade: I2 = 37%; p = 0,14), embora haja algum grau de imprecisão para a importância clínica deste efeito, comprovado pelo IC.Finalmente, um ECR publicado já na fase final de escrita deste documento também corrobora os achados desta revisão sistemática.34 Liu et al.34 incluíram 11.255 participantes chineses de alto risco cardiovascular (4.359 com diabetes e 3.022 com acidente vascular cerebral prévio) que foram designados para tratamento intensivo (n = 5.624) ou tratamento padrão (n = 5.631). A idade média foi de 64,6 anos. A média da PA sistólica durante o acompanhamento foi de 119,1 mmHg (desvio padrão: 11,1) no grupo de tratamento intensivo e 134,8 mmHg (desvio padrão: 10,5) no grupo de tratamento padrão. Durante uma mediana de 3,4 anos de acompanhamento, desfechos primários ocorreram em 547 (9,7%) participantes no grupo de tratamento intensivo e 623 (11,1%) no grupo de tratamento padrão (HR = 0,88; IC 95% = 0,78 a 0,99). Eventos adversos graves de síncope foram infrequentes, e ocorreram com maior frequência no grupo de tratamento intensivo (n = 24 [0,4%] de 5.624) do que no grupo de tratamento padrão (n = 8 [0,1%] de 5.631; HR = 3,00, IC 95% = 1,35 a 6,68). Não houve diferença significativa entre os grupos nos eventos adversos graves de hipotensão, anormalidade eletrolítica, queda prejudicial ou injúria renal aguda.Outros fatores, além de benefícios e malefícios clínicos, devem ser considerados por um Painel de Recomendações ao tomar a decisão final para uma recomendação clínica, de acordo com a estrutura de Evidências para Decisão da metodologia GRADE. O custo é um desses fatores. No Brasil, as principais classes de medicamentos anti-hipertensivos são fornecidas gratuitamente pelo Ministério da Saúde em todo o país, o que facilita a implementação da estratégia intensiva recomendada neste documento.35A adesão dos pacientes aos medicamentos prescritos pode ser um desafio, pois metas mais rigorosas de controle da PA normalmente exigem o uso maior de medicamentos para alcançar os resultados desejados. Estratégias para melhorar a adesão, como simplificar os esquemas posológicos (prescrevendo medicamentos que requerem um menor número de doses por dia),36 utilizar medicamentos combinados em um único comprimido,37 incentivar os pacientes a monitorarem sua PA no domicílio38 e promover uma relação próxima entre os profissionais de saúde e os pacientes,39 podem contribuir para o sucesso da estratégia.Outra abordagem para melhorar a adesão dos pacientes é envolvê-los no processo de tomada de decisão. Utilizando calculadoras de predição de risco cardiovascular, é possível determinar a probabilidade individual de eventos cardiovasculares nos próximos 10 anos.40 Com base nessa estimativa, os pacientes podem ser esclarecidos sobre o real significado de uma redução adicional na PA e consequentemente no risco cardiovascular futuro, considerando também as possíveis desvantagens (eventos adversos, custo, adesão, etc.). Isso permite uma melhor compreensão da estratégia proposta como um todo, e o efeito da estratégia por tempo indeterminado.Esta revisão sistemática e metanálise apresenta algumas limitações. Primeiramente, há uma compreensível heterogeneidade entre as características dos diversos estudos sobre o tema. Eles diferem em vários aspectos, incluindo as definições das metas de tratamento intensivo anti-hipertensivo, a idade média dos participantes, os métodos de medida da PA e o risco cardiovascular basal dos pacientes incluídos, entre outros. Em segundo lugar, há informações limitadas nos estudos em relação à progressão da doença renal em pacientes já acometidos por doença renal crônica. Embora este tenha sido um desfecho clínico predefinido no protocolo, não foi amplamente investigado nos estudos incluídos, o que impede a formulação de conclusões definitivas. Por último, o tempo de seguimento dos estudos variou entre dois e cinco anos, aproximadamente. O tempo de tratamento para HA é indefinido, a princípio para o total de vida restante do paciente hipertenso. Portanto, o efeito clínico comprovado em um número limitado de anos pode estar subdimensionado para uma estratégia clínica de muito mais longo prazo.ConclusãoA HA continua sendo um enorme desafio em saúde, com profundas implicações para a morbidade e mortalidade cardiovascular da população brasileira. Os achados desta revisão ressaltam os benefícios das metas intensivas de tratamento anti-hipertensivo, que demonstraram reduzir significativamente a incidência de eventos cardiovasculares importantes. No entanto, a decisão de adotar metas mais agressivas de controle da PA deve ser individualizada, levando-se em consideração fatores específicos do paciente, como idade, fragilidade e risco de eventos adversos. Além disso, garantir a adesão dos pacientes aos esquemas medicamentosos prescritos é crucial para o sucesso de qualquer estratégia de tratamento. Ao considerar os potenciais benefícios e riscos, envolvendo o paciente na tomada de decisão final, os profissionais de saúde podem otimizar o manejo da HA e melhorar os resultados clínicos do paciente e do sistema de saúde."}

However, the prognosis of baseline PH on MR patients after M-TEER has been controversial. This meta-analysis aimed to determine the prognostic value of PH with early and late outcomes after M-TEER with MitraClip. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and Web of Science for studies. The results of the meta-analysis are summarized as the hazard ratio (HR), odds ratios (ORs) or mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: A total of 20 publications were included in the systematic review, of which six were observational cohort studies including 5684 patients. The pooled incidence estimate of all-cause mortality was more common in severe PH than in patients who were non-PH. On pooled multivariate analysis, baseline PH was associated with late (≥1-year) all-cause mortality (HR = 1.61, 95% CI [1.23–2.11]) and the combined outcome of late HF rehospitalization and all-cause mortality (HR = 1.33, 95% CI [1.15–1.53]) after M-TEER. The level of SPAP significantly decreased after MitraClip in MR patients with PH (MD = −12.33 mmHg, 95% CI [−14.08–−10.58]). Conclusions: Baseline PH had a worse prognosis of early (≥30-day) cardiac mortality, late all-cause mortality as well as the composite outcome of HF rehospitalization and all-cause mortality after M-TEER compared to non-PH patients. Future studies are needed to prove these findings.", "body": "1. IntroductionMitral regurgitation (MR) is the most prevalent valvular heart disease (VHD) requiring treatment with an adverse prognosis, which brings a heavy burden to public health and impairs quality of life [1]. Transcatheter mitral valve repair (TMVr) is the potential alternative therapy for high-surgical-risk patients suffering severe MR so far; in particular, mitral valve transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (M-TEER) is available for degenerative/primary MR (DMR) and functional/secondary MR (FMR) patients with a favorable physiology and anatomy whose symptoms persist despite with optimal guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) [2,3,4]. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a heterogenous disease entity presenting with different clinical phenotypes, which frequently occurs as the downstream consequence and not the cause of MR, and it is referred for surgical or catheter-based mitral valve replacement or repair for severe MR [5,6,7]. Previous studies have shown that PH has been associated with increased mortality and morbidity following the intervention for MR, and often marks a phenotype of disease progression [8,9,10,11]. Based on the pooled available literature, there are discordant hemodynamic definitions of PH in studies. The prognostic impact of PH, defined as an elevated systolic pulmonary artery pressure (SPAP) ≥ 50 mmHg assessed by Doppler echocardiography [12] or a mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) ≥ 25 mmHg measured invasively by right heart catheterization (RHC) at rest [13], on sever FMR patients following M-TEER with the MitraClip system has not been established. Thus, our aims for this meta-analysis are to systematically review the studies and qualitatively and quantitatively synthesize the literature on the association of baseline PH and early and late outcomes after percutaneous mitral valve repair (PMVr) with MitraClip.2. Methods2.1. Search StrategyAccording to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, a systematic review protocol was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews PROSPERO (CRD42025643035), and a literature search was conducted across the PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE (Excerpta Media Database), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and the Web of Science from inception to September 2024, based on the PICO (population, intervention or exposure, comparison, outcome) strategy using the following keywords: “mitral regurgitation”, “pulmonary hypertension”, “transcatheter mitral valve repair”, “edge-to-edge repair”, “percutaneous mitral valve repair”, “MitraClip”, “TMVr”, “TEER”, “PMVr”, “PH”, “MR” for English-language, peer-reviewed publications. The search code was used for all analyses in the review as presented in Supplementary Materials Figure S1. References for original and review articles were cross-checked. Institutional review board approval and patient consent were not required because of the systematic review and meta-analysis nature of this study.2.2. Study Selection and Eligibility CriteriaStudies were included in the meta-analysis that fulfilled one of the following criteria: (1) in the English language and publication in peer-reviewed journals; (2) reporting PH after TMVr in MR; and (3) including quantitative raw data for predictors of interest, both with the availability of primary outcome data. Identified records were imported in EndNote X9.3.3. We followed the PRISMA checklist for the protocol of this meta-analysis. Studies were excluded that: (1) duplicated or overlapped publication; (2) constituted articles without primary data; (3) involved patients treated by MR surgery; (4) were non-human studies, conference abstracts, editorials or reviews.2.3. Data Extraction and OutcomesTwo physician reviewers, SCJ and YBL, independently evaluated study eligibility and study quality and performed data extraction using standardized data collection sheets, and used the Newcastle–Ottawa quality scale (NOS), which evaluates in 3 domains, selection, comparability, and outcomes. The year of publication, study design, the number of enrolled centers, countries, the mean or median age of population, and the number of enrolled PH and non-PH patients were collected from each study. Discrepancies in the selection of relevant studies and data extraction were solved by consensus after consulting a third investigator, JLL. Data on study and patient characteristics, clinical and echocardiographic characteristics, and outcomes were extracted. For PH as a dichotomous parameter, HR and 95% CI were reported at 50 mmHg in SPAP or 25 mmHg in mPAP. Meanwhile, for PH as a continuous parameter, HR and 95% CI were reported per 1 mmHg in increased SPAP. The extracted information was tabulated according to pre-determined templates specified in our protocol (PROSPERO: CRD42025643035). Data extracted from the included studies and used for all analyses in the review are presented in Figure 1.2.4. Statistical AnalysiszThe results of the meta-analysis were summarized as hazard ratio (HR) or odds ratio (OR) and 95% CI. HR and OR were pooled using inverse variance weighting and Mantel–Haenszel weighting, respectively. Heterogeneity across studies was tested by the Cochran’s Q statistic and Higgins’ and Thompson’s I2 statistics. I2 > 50% and p ≤ 0.1 were considered to constitute significant heterogeneity, where random-effect models were used to estimate the between-study variance. Otherwise, the fixed-effect model was used for this meta-analysis. p < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant for other results. All analyses were conducted using Review Manager version 5.4 (The Cochrane Collaboration).3. Results3.1. Search Results and Study Quality EvaluationA total of 941 studies were screened at title and abstract level, of which 20 [14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33] were examined in full text and ultimately included in this meta-analysis, considering that MitraClip approval was in 2008. The study selection process is shown in Figure 1. We pooled only six observational cohort studies [14,23,24,27,28,32] that reported early and late outcomes after M-TEER for patients with baseline PH vs. non-PH patients (encompassing 1163 patients with PH and 4523 without PH), and pooled HR for ≥1-year all-cause mortality after MitraClip as the primary endpoint of the analysis, which fulfilled the prespecified inclusion criteria for the present systematic review and meta-analysis (Table 1A). One prospective registry and one MitraClip arm from the Cardiovascular Outcomes Assessment of the MitraClip Percutaneous Therapy for Heart Failure Patients with Functional Mitral Regurgitation (COAPT) trial [24]. Most, 14 out of 20, eligible studies were single-center and retrospective in nature, some of which [15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,25,26,29,30,31,33] were not specifically designed to assess the impact of PH on clinical outcomes, pooled univariate and multivariate HRs for ≥1-year all-cause mortality after TMVr (Table 1B). All studies were categorized as high quality, with NOS ranging from 6 to 8 (Supplementary Materials Table S1).3.2. Baseline CharacteristicsOverall baseline characteristics are outlined in Table 1. The total number of enrolled patients in the individual studies ranged from 91 to 4071, accounting for 5684 patients. Patients had a mean age of 79.2 ± 8.9 years and were predominantly male (58.9%). The follow-up duration ranged from 1 year to 5 years.3.3. Early and Late Outcomes and Sensitivity Analysis3.3.1. Pooled ORs of Early (30-Day) Cardiac and Non-Cardiac Mortality After M-TEERIn this quantitatively pooled analysis, the ≥30-day cardiac mortality as an outcome was used by three studies in total. Compared with non-PH patients, those with PH had a significant statistically difference in terms of early (≥30-day) cardiac mortality (OR 1.37, 95% CI [0.98–1.91], p = 0.06), without significant heterogeneity (I2 = 0, Q test p = 0.42). However, baseline severe PH had non-significant statistically difference in terms of ≥30-day non-cardiac mortality (OR 0.90, 95% CI [0.38–2.15], p = 0.82), with moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 57%, Q test p = 0.10) (Figure 2A). The random-effect model was used to combine the results.3.3.2. Pooled ORs of Early (30-Day) and Late (≥1-Year) All-Cause Mortality After PMVrThe three pooled studies reported the prognosis of PH on 30-day and ≥1-year mortality, amounting to a total number 794 and 3646 patients at 30-day follow-up, 614 and 2658 patients at 1-year follow-up, between patients with and without PH. A forest plot demonstrates a statistically significant difference between the pooled 30-day all-cause mortality (OR 1.62, 95% CI [1.20–2.20], p = 0.02) and the ≥1-year all-cause mortality (OR 1.57, 95% CI [1.28–1.93], p < 0.0001). As both of these demonstrated insignificant heterogeneity (I2 = 0, Q test p = 0.61, and I2 = 0, Q test p = 0.93, respectively) the fixed-effect model was used (Figure 2B).3.3.3. Echocardiographic Follow-Up: Pooled Estimated MD of SPAP After M-TEER Within 30 DaysIn terms of the pooled pre- and post-MitraCip SPAP, there are three studies that reported this content. Overall, there was a significant improvement of SPAP elevation after the M-TEER at 30-day follow-up compared to baseline (MD = −12.33 mmHg, 95% CI [−14.08–−10.58]), and no heterogeneity was observed (I2  = 0, Q test p = 0.55), which was statistically significant (Z = 13.83, p < 0.00001) (Figure 3).3.3.4. Late (≥1-Year) HF Rehospitalization After TMVr (Univariate Analysis)For the four included studies assessing SPAP as a dichotomous parameter, as the heterogeneity test (I2 = 63%, Q test p = 0.03) showed the considerable heterogeneity among these studies, the random-effect model was performed to the combined results. The prognosis on late (≥1-year) HF rehospitalization in patients with PH (univariate HR = 1.10, 95%CI [0.89–1.36]) indicated a non-significant difference (Z = 0.90, p = 0.37) (Figure 4).3.3.5. Late (≥1-Year) All-Cause Mortality After TMVr (Univariate Analysis and Multivariable Analysis)When assessing SPAP as a continuous parameter, with a heterogeneity test (I2 = 44%, Q test p = 0.08) that indicated significant heterogeneity among these seven studies, the random-effect model was used to combine the results (Figure 5A). The pooled HR revealed that the baseline PH (elevated SPAP) was insignificantly associated with ≥1-year all-cause mortality (Univariate-HR = 1.01, 95% CI [1.00–1.02]), and that this was statistically significant (Z = 2.66, p = 0.08). A total of nine studies reported HR for the all-cause mortality evaluating elevated SPAP as a dichotomous variable; the pooled overall incidence of the late (≥1-year) all-cause mortality (multivariate HR = 1.61, 95% CI [1.23–2.11]) was statistically significant (Z = 3.48, p = 0.0005). However, the heterogeneity test [I2 = 60%, Q test p = 0.01] indicated significant heterogeneity, respectively, among these studies (Figure 5B).3.3.6. Late (≥1-Year) Combined Outcome of HF Rehospitalization and All-Cause Mortality After M-TEER (Multivariable Analysis)Three studies with 4261 patients reported the HR for the combined outcome of HF rehospitalization and all-cause mortality. Since sensitivity analysis showed insignificant heterogeneity (I2 = 25%, Q test p = 0.5), the random-effect model was used (Figure 5C). The pooled results show that baseline PH was associated with a late (≥1-year) combined outcome (Multivariate-HR = 1.33, 95% CI [1.15–1.53]) after M-TEER, which was statistically significant (Z = 3.86, p = 0.0001).3.4. Publication BiasWe only evaluated the publication bias of the pooled analysis of late all-cause mortality after M-TEER with MitraClip (both SPAP as a continuous and dichotomous parameter and mPAP as a dichotomous parameter) due to limited data in other pooled results. Visual examination of the funnel plot symmetry did not indicate publication bias in the included studies (Supplementary Materials Figure S2).4. Discussion4.1. Principal FindingsThis was a meta-analysis of mainly retrospective observational studies, the main results of the meta-analysis were as follows: (1) patients with symptomatic severe FMR-concomitant PH had a higher risk for early or late all-cause mortality after M-TEER; (2) on pooled univariate and multivariate analysis, PH was associated with the pooled estimated of late (≥1-year) all-cause mortality (Multivariate-HR = 1.33, 95% CI [1.15–1.53]), the combined outcome of HF rehospitalization and all-cause mortality after PMVr (Multivariate-HR = 1.43, 95%CI [1.16–1.77]); (3) the level of SPAP significantly improved after M-TEER (MD = −12.33 mmHg, 95% CI [−14.08–−10.58]). Herein, baseline PH is associated with poor prognosis in FMR patients who underwent TMVr with MitraCip, even despite a substantial reduction in SPAP. Although prior studies have investigated the implications of PH (elevated SPAP) on TMVr, overall, these results are also intriguing. When assessing SPAP as a continuous parameter or a dichotomous variable, respectively, there are discordant pooled HRs for early and late all-cause mortality after M-TEER. Additionally, compared with non-PH patients, those with PH had a higher risk of early (≥30-day) cardiac mortality. These findings emphasize the heterogeneity of PH, and the clinical prognosis of catheter-based intervention in determining the extent to which elevated SPAP or clinical types of PH are directly or indirectly related to severe FMR.4.2. Potential MechanismsPH is a common pathophysiological consequence of left-sided VHD, which is also a frequent complication of severe FMR due to flailing mitral valve leaflets and caused by alterations in left ventricle (LV) or left atrial (LA) function or geometry [6,34]. Indeed, the underlying pathogenesis of PH in chronic FMR typically involves a constellation of processes: in the initial compensated phases; pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) is normal, and patients remain asymptomatic. A reversible transmission of elevated LA pressure to the pulmonary circulation constitutes a direct relationship. Chronic LA pressure/volume overload might irreversibly increase PVR and alter the pulmonary vascular bed over time; in a subset of PH-LHD patients this can result in right ventricle (RV) dilatation and hypertrophy in the final decompensated phase, which in turn might lead to tricuspid regurgitation, RV and/or LV enlargement or dysfunction, a vicious circle of MR, in an indirect relationship [35,36]. In those patient populations with severe FMR and PH, even though the precise factors that determine the compensation and decompensation stage changes in pulmonary vascular and right heart structure and function remain unclear, the absence of left-side cardiac pathology and elevated SPAP and/or mPAP may lead to a denial of the contribution of MR to PH-LHD [37,38]. Meanwhile, the hemodynamic characteristics and the prognostically relevant indexes of left-side heart function and clinical data regarding the short- or long-term evolution of pulmonary vascular and left heart alteration changes in severe FMR patients, have yet to be studied. Although RHC is the gold standard for diagnosing PH and its subtypes, echocardiography has become established as the primary tool for evaluating the diagnosis and severity of PH. In addition, in previous studies there has been a positive correlation between RHC and echocardiography measurements, since most PH pharmacotherapeutic intervention studies have utilized the classical definition of mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) at rest > 25 mmHg based on an RHC or SPAP ≥ 50 mmHg, assessed by echocardiography, while no prior clinical study in M-TEER has estimated both echocardiography and RHC measurements [39,40]. The 2020 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines do not specially recommend an SPAP cut-off to guide mitral valve intervention [3]. However, in accordance with the updated 2021 guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the European Respiratory Society (ERS), the current definition of PH is based on an mPAP at rest > 20 mmHg assessed by cardiac catheterization, and may further distinguish the hemodynamic PH subgroups and stage disease severity, or emphasize earlier diagnosis. Indeed, the World Health Organization (WHO) has classified PH into five clinical categories: pulmonary arterial hypertension; PH with left-side heart disease (PH-LHD); lung diseases and/or hypoxia; pulmonary artery obstructions (particularly thromboembolic PH); and undifferentiated or multifactorial causes. Among these, PH-LHD is the most prevalent subtype with an estimated prevalence of approximately 50% to 80%, which can be classified as pre-capillary PH or isolated post-capillary PH (Ipc-PH) and combined post- and pre-capillary PH (Cpc-PH) consistent with the general definitions of PH [3,6,41]. VHD-associated PH is considered a subgroup within WHO group 2. Typically, chronic PH-LHD secondary to MR development leads to persistent PVR and fibrosis and the remolding of pulmonary vascular via pulmonary arterial and arteriole vasoconstriction and thickening characterized by endothelial injury and/or dysfunction, resulting in excessive collagen deposition, an imbalance in the endothelial production of nitric oxide (NO) and endothelin-1 (ET-1) [42]. Several studies have demonstrated that NO and ET-1, as a mediators of endothelial dysfunction, have potential involvement in WHO group 2 PH (PH-LHD) [43,44]. Although pharmacotherapy with basic NO pathway-based pulmonary vasodilator-inhaled NO or phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (or any other pulmonary vasodilator, e.g., ET blockers or a prostacyclin analog/receptor) translates to real-world routine practice for PH, the clinical impact of ET blockers and NO in PH-LHD remains to be determined since most trials did not have positive results [45,46,47]. The current guidelines recommend phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors for patients with Cpc-PH but not for Ipc-PH [6]. Two randomized, controlled, double-blind studies reveal that there was a positive outcome due to the use of sildenafil post procedure in PH patients following mitral valve intervention [48,49]. There are insufficient data to recommend the off-label use of pulmonary vasodilators in PH patients in secondary VHD (PH-LHD). Yet no approved pharmacological therapies exist that directly target PH-LHD. The latest ESC/ERS guideline recommends mitral valve surgery for patients with severe DMR-concomitant PH (defined as SPAP ≥ 50 mmHg) as carrying an acceptable surgical risk [12]. Meanwhile, the threshold of PASP at 50 mmHg as an indication for M-TEER has not been validated yet [50]. Importantly, given the threshold of PH as an indication for TMVr, but whether SPAP and/or mPAP should represent a sufficient parameter to guide M-TEER, or which PH-LHD patient subsets (both Ipc-PH and Cpc-PH) acquire clinical benefits and significant hemodynamics improvement after M-TEER, should be the focus of future studies. Given that most of the included studies did not distinguish between different types of PH (pre-capillary, IpcPH, and CpcPH) and different degrees of severity of PH (mild, moderate or severe PH), this study cannot systematically evaluate the interventional therapies in PH-LHD based on the currently available data. To summarize, so far, despite only a few prior data being available about the hemodynamic severity and types of PH in this meta-analysis, which showed the standard MD of SPAP before and after M-TEER within a 6-month follow-up, it seems that improvement in SPAP (pooled standard of MD = −1.03 mmHg) did occur in the severe PH group (Supplementary Materials Figure S3). A recent post hoc analysis reported a correlation between different hemodynamic types of PH and the hemodynamic response to MitraClip and the hemodynamic improvements in patients with Ipc-PH and Cpc-PH; however, the prognostic value of clinical outcomes is limited [33]. Therefore, these results need to be confirmed in larger future studies. Other invasive hemodynamic markers, such as pulmonary arterial compliance and right ventricular–pulmonary artery coupling have proven to be promising prognostic markers in cohort studies, but have not been tested in clinical trials. Additionally, it is important to distinguish PH from PH-LHD in isolation, and no prior study specializing M-TEER has evaluated both echocardiography and invasive measurements for PH. Therefore, the investigation of such markers and measurements would be of clinical interest to facilitate the identification of those FMR patients with significant pulmonary vascular disease who might possibly respond well to M-TEER therapy. A comprehensive evaluation of PH before a MitraClip intervention is necessary for selecting appropriate patients with FMR.M-TEER with MitraClip mimicking the surgical Alfieri technique is a mature and guideline-recommended interventional method for high-surgical-risk patients with severe symptomatic MR [51]. The MitraClip pulls the anterior and posterior flailing leaflets together and creates a double-orifice mitral area, which modifies the physiology of diastolic transvalvular flow and reduces or eliminates MR severity, also potentially improving PH-LHD and LV afterload. Typically, after MitraClip use, the reversibility of PH depends on the severity and subtype of the FMR, and the pathophysiological adaptations of left heart. In this analysis, we observed an improvement in SPAP with a pooled estimate of MD = −12.33 mmHg beyond the 30-day post-M-TEER in patients with severe PH compared to baseline SPAP levels, indicating an early MR correction might improve severe PH. Prior studies have reported that patients with PH after TMVr would present a significant improvement of SPAP, which is consistent with the finding of this meta-analysis [52,53]. Similarly, patients with improved SPAP after TMVr could achieve better clinical outcomes when compared with those without a decrease in SPAP [27]. Previous studies have shown that LV unloading in patients who coexist with PH leads to a significant reduction in SPAP and transpulmonary gradient, highlighting the reversibility of PH [53,54]. It is reasonable to hypothesize that MitraClip treatment reduces the MR, resulting an improvement in the pulmonary vascular component, especially the post-capillary component, which decreases elevated SPAP/mPAP in PH patients, and consequently improves LV/LA volume and function, breaking the vicious circle that can lead to a worsening of PH-LHD. Accordingly, given the potential reversibility of PH, and the efficacy and safety profiles of MitraClip therapy, it is crucial to determine the optimal timing of M-TEER in patients with MR-concomitant PH or medically manage the pre-capillary PH in the pre-MitraClip phase, and define the role of PMVr in patients with PH-LHD. Furthermore, this meta-analysis showed that MR patients with PH are not only associated with ≥30-day cardiac mortality, but also with ≥1-year all-cause mortality and the composite outcome after M-TEER. In the two prior analyses, both COAPT and percutaneous repair with the MitraClip device for severe functional/secondary MR (MITRA-FR) trials demonstrated discordant results that might come from different inclusion criteria; it seems appropriate that patient selection would be needed for successful PMVr. In the COAPT trial, patients treated with M-TEER in combination with GDMT had a lower incidence of mortality and HF rehospitalization regardless of elevated SPAP (PASP > 50 mm Hg), which indicated a role for M-TEER in addition to GDMT in managing patients with severe FMR [2,24]. Conversely, in the MITRA-FR trial, enrolled patients who had a high LV dimension showed no clinical benefit from the MitraClip therapy over GDMT in patients with severe FMR [55]. The contemporary randomized study of the MitraClip device in heart failure patients with clinically significant functional MR (RESHAPE-HF2) is a prospective, randomized, multicenter trial including patients with moderate-to-severe FMR and with a higher proportion of patients on GDMT than in the other two studies, which reported that earlier MitraClip treatment could reduce HF hospitalizations and improve quality of life in these patients [56]. Moreover, patients in the MITRA-FR trial and RESHAPE-HF2 trial had a mean LV end-diastolic volume (EDV) of 252 mL and 211 mL, respectively, compared with the EDV of 194 mL observed in the COAPT trial. These results demonstrate that M-TEER improves outcomes in patients with FMR, and assessed the impact of LV remodeling on MitraClip treatment success. In clinical practice, clarifying which patients who have risk-to-benefit and cost-to-benefit ratios that favor catheter-based therapy and the selection criteria for M-TEER, especially in terms of identifying risk factors associated with poor outcomes after intervention and in FMR patients with PH, are critical. Future intervention studies are needed to systematically collect both invasive and non-invasive data to characterize PH (especially PH-LHD) in FMR to further identify the hemodynamic and clinical profile of the PH substrate, suggesting probable benefits or the lack thereof.4.3. LimitationsSeveral limitations merit acknowledgement in this meta-analysis: (1) As all the included studies were observational and non-randomized trails, the quality of the published data is relatively low. (2) The eligible studies were relatively rare in terms of the establishment of prognostic values. In addition, we are unable to further analyze the impact of different clinical outcomes and post-procedural complications after TMVr due to these data not being reported fully in the primary studies. (3) As mentioned before, the cut-off for the definition of severe PH remains undetermined; here using 50 mmHg by non-invasive Doppler echocardiography as the cut-off value, whereas invasive RHC was not measured in the included studies. (4) Although data on HR for the combined outcomes and estimated MD for SPAP after M-TEER were included in only three studies, respectively, and sensitivity analysis was performed, we found that randomly deleting the articles in these studies did not affect the results of the study, indicating that the meta-analysis was robust. While meta-analyses can enhance the precision of event rate estimation, aggregating studies with diverse designs and varying quality may also introduce systematic bias. Owing to the aforesaid drawbacks, the aims of this review could not be accomplished fully.5. ConclusionsThe present study found that baseline SPAP might serve as a valuable parameter for the identification of patients at a high risk of severe FMR even after successful M-TEER. Despite MitraClip intervention improving the hemodynamics of PH, severe PH resulted in a worse prognosis in patients with MR compared to non-PH patients. Further and larger multi-center and adequately powered randomized trials with longer-term follow-up are needed to determine whether SPAP/mPAP is a sufficient parameter to guide M-TEER in FMR, and whether early intervention for MR-concomitant PH-LHD patients for whom evidence for the use of PH medications is limited might improve clinical outcomes, and which patient subsets will benefit the most from M-TEER with MitraClip."}

Radiofrequency ablation (RFA), particularly epicardial ablation, is recommended for BrS patients with recurrent VA unresponsive to conventional treatments like implantable cardioverter‐defibrillators (ICD) and quinidine. This study aims to evaluate the long‐term efficacy of epicardial RFA in preventing VA recurrence in BrS.MethodsA systematic search of PubMed, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Library, and ProQuest databases was conducted following PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Studies on RFA for VA in BrS were included. Primary outcomes were VA recurrence and all‐cause mortality. Statistical analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.4.ResultsEpicardial, endocardial, and combined ablation strategies effectively reduced VA recurrence, decreased ICD shocks, and improved clinical outcomes in BrS. Epicardial ablation RFA near coronary arteries showed a notable reduction in VA recurrence, while endocardial ablation remained a viable alternative. Meta‐analysis revealed a significant reduction in VA recurrence (RR 0.17; 95% CI 0.07–0.43; p < .0001) and ICD shocks (RR 0.13; 95% CI 0.04–0.44; p = .001). Subgroup analysis suggested greater VA reduction with epicardial ablation, though without statistical significance.ConclusionEpicardial RFA is associated with a significant reduction in recurrent VAs (83%) and ICD shock rates (87%) in patients with BrS. The procedure demonstrates a favorable long‐term safety profile, with no mortality reported in the included studies.", "body": "1INTRODUCTIONBrugada syndrome (BrS) is a rare electrical abnormality of the heart.\n1\n BrS is relatively uncommon, with an estimated global prevalence of 0.05% and a Brugada pattern frequency of 0.4%. However, individuals of Southeast Asian descent show a higher prevalence, at approximately 3.7 per 1000.\n2\n Patients who initially arrived with syncope and a spontaneous BrS ECG sign had a 19% likelihood of recurrence, compared to 69% for those who present with aborted sudden death.\n3\n Because of the underlying genetic and cellular anomalies in the heart's electrical circuitry, ventricular arrhythmia (VA) in BrS may recur.Quinidine or catheter ablation has been effective in lowering the frequency of implantable cardioverter‐defibrillator (ICD) shocks in patients with ventricular fibrillation (VF) who experience recurrent shocks. However, up to 37% of people may experience negative side effects from quinidine, and quinidine is unavailable in many nations. The ST‐segment elevation in the right precordial leads and the incidence of VF in BrS patients may be caused by an aberrant fibrotic arrhythmogenic substrate in the epicardial Right Ventricular Outflow Tract (RVOT), according to electrophysiological mapping data connected to histological investigations. In 75% of patients, ablation of these aberrant regions can significantly reduce recurrent VF and return the ECG to normal.\n4\n, \n5\n\nThe main cause of BrS is an aberrant electrical substrate in the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT), more precisely in the myocardium's epicardial layer. Abnormalities in depolarization and repolarization cause reentrant circuits, delayed activation, and slowing of conduction, which increases the risk of VF or ventricular tachycardia (VT). The distinctive ST‐segment elevation in BrS is caused by epicardial anomalies, including conduction delay and decreased sodium channel expression.\n6\n\nIn BrS, the arrhythmogenic substrate is frequently limited to the RVOT's epicardial surface. Arrhythmia‐causing triggers and circuits are eliminated by ablation of this epicardial substrate.\n7\n Endocardial ablation is inadequate in BrS because the aberrant substrate is mainly in the epicardium. In drug‐resistant VF, endocardial ablation of VF triggers with substrate modification is a reasonable first line of treatment. If QRS notch or fractionated electrograms are present at the endocardial surface of the RVOT, endocardial ablation is insufficient, and an epicardial approach may be a more successful final strategy. This study aimed to evaluate the long‐term benefits of epicardial RFA and its benefit for recurrent VA in BrS.2METHODS2.1Study designA thorough search strategy was implemented to identify relevant studies for inclusion in this systematic review and meta‐analysis. Searches were conducted across several electronic databases, including PubMed, Science Direct, Cochrane Library, and ProQuest. The database for BrS ablation studies was first accessed on June 2024. The search spanned from the inception of each database up to September 2024. The keywords used for the search included “ablation,” “brugada,” and “ventricular arrhythmia.” Titles and abstracts of all identified studies were screened, and reference lists from these studies were also reviewed to locate additional relevant research. The search process followed PRISMA 2020 guidelines, and the study was prospectively registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42024594484). Study selection was carried out independently by the authors, who applied predefined inclusion criteria, focusing on studies investigating outcomes of catheter or surgical RFA in patients with BrS, using previously established diagnostic criteria. Final study eligibility was determined after a full‐text review, and any disagreements were resolved through discussion among the authors.2.2Eligibility criteriaStudies were eligible for inclusion if they met the following criteria: (1) the study population comprised patients diagnosed with BrS according to established diagnostic criteria; (2) the intervention involved catheter‐based or surgical RFA aimed at treating VA in BrS; (3) the study reported relevant clinical outcomes, including VA recurrence and/or all‐cause mortality; and (4) both interventional and observational study designs were considered. No restrictions were applied with regard to language, publication year, or duration of follow‐up.2.3Outcomes measuredThe primary outcomes assessed in this study include the recurrence of VT, sudden cardiac death (SCD), and all‐cause mortality. Any additional relevant outcomes were incorporated if present. VT recurrence was defined by the documentation of sustained episodes of VT during follow‐up, identified through ECG, 24‐hour Holter monitoring, or appropriate ICD responses (shock or anti‐tachycardia pacing). VT recurrence data were gathered pre‐ and postablation for each patient. SCD was defined as unexpected death from cardiac causes occurring suddenly, usually within 1 h, as documented during follow‐up. All‐cause mortality included any death reported during the follow‐up period, regardless of cause. Subgroup analyses were performed based on the ablation site, whether epicardial, endocardial, or a combination of both.2.4Data extractions and quality appraisalStandardized forms were used to extract key information from each included study, covering three main areas: study characteristics, population characteristics, and outcomes. For study characteristics, the following details were recorded: (i) author and year of publication, (ii) country of study, (iii) study design and methodology, (iv) total sample size, and (v) follow‐up duration. Population characteristics included: (i) baseline demographic and clinical features, (ii) type of ablation procedure (catheter and/or surgical), and (iii) ablation site (epicardial and/or endocardial). Outcome data were extracted based on the endpoint measures specified in the study, with a focus on the primary and secondary outcomes outlined in the current meta‐analysis protocol.The methodological quality of the studies will be assessed using appropriate evaluation tools. For RCTs, the assessment will be conducted using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool, which evaluates bias across seven domains, including randomization, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and researchers, and outcome reporting. For nonrandomized studies, quality assessment will be conducted using the Newcastle‐Ottawa Scale (NOS), which evaluates participant selection, group comparability, and outcome assessment. Potential biases, whether from study design, reporting, or publication, will be identified and reported. Any discrepancies between reviewers during the quality assessment were resolved through detailed discussions. If consensus could not be reached, a third independent reviewer was consulted to adjudicate the differences.2.5Quality assessment and statistical analysisFor interventional studies, such as randomized controlled trials (RCTs), the risk of bias was categorized as low, moderate, or high. Observational studies were assessed using the previously stated scoring system, classifying them as low quality (<5 points), moderate quality (5–7 points), or high quality (>7 points). Only studies with low risk of bias or rated as high quality were included in the quantitative analysis.Data for a specific variable were synthesized only if it was reported in at least two included studies. Continuous variables were presented as means with standard deviation (SD). Heterogeneity among study populations was evaluated using the I\n2 and T\n2 statistics. When I\n2 was <50% or T\n2 >0,05, a Mantel–Haenszel (M‐H) fixed‐effect model was applied to summarize data; if criteria were not met, a random‐effects model was used. Subgroup analyses of primary outcomes were compared with the Z statistic. Funnel plots were used to assess publication bias. All analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.4.3RESULTS3.1Selection of the studiesThe selection of study process adhered to the PRISMA 2020 guidelines. At the beginning of the study selection process, a primary search was conducted, which yielded an initial total of 3147 studies. After following the PRISMA guideline, a total of 17 studies met all the inclusion criteria and were suitable to include in this study (Figure 1).FIGURE 1PRISMA flow diagram.3.2Characteristics of included studiesThere was a total of 17 studies included in this study.\n4\n, \n8\n, \n9\n, \n10\n, \n11\n, \n12\n, \n13\n, \n14\n, \n15\n, \n16\n, \n17\n, \n18\n, \n19\n, \n20\n, \n21\n, \n22\n, \n23\n All of the included studies were cohort studies.

However, the studies included show a high level of heterogeneity, indicated by an I\n2 value of 94% (p‐value <.00001) suggesting differences in the magnitude of the effect across the studies. Furthermore, the funnel plot indicates some degree of asymmetry, which may suggest the presence of publication bias or heterogeneity, especially among the smaller studies (Figure 2A).FIGURE 2Forest plot analysis of (A) overall recurrent VA event before and after ablation; and (B) subgroup analysis based on ablation site.To address this issue and gain further insight into the differential effects of the ablation strategies, we performed subgroup analyses based on the ablation site—specifically, epicardial versus endocardial ablation. This stratification was chosen because Brugada syndrome is characterized by an arrhythmogenic substrate predominantly located in the epicardium. Epicardial ablation, therefore, represents a targeted substrate modification approach, whereas endocardial ablation primarily aims to eliminate arrhythmia triggers, such as premature ventricular contractions and monomorphic ventricular tachycardia. By analyzing these subgroups separately, we sought to clarify the relative effectiveness of each technique and provide a more nuanced interpretation of the treatment outcomes.In subgroup analysis, the overall pooled risk ratio for epicardial ablation and endocardial ablation was 0.13 (95% CI 0.06–0.30; p‐value <.00001) and 0.35 (95% CI 0.09–1.30; p‐value = .12), which suggests a significant reduction in the event rates after epicardial ablation but not after endocardial ablation. However, the test for subgroup differences showed that there was no statistically significant difference between the epicardial and endocardial subgroups (Chi2 = 1.47; p‐value = .22; I\n2 = 31.1%). Furthermore, the funnel plot also indicates some degree of asymmetry both in the epicardial and endocardial ablation groups, which may suggest the presence of publication bias or heterogeneity, especially among the smaller studies (Figure 2B).3.5Implantable cardioverter‐defibrillator shocksOur analysis included a total of 456 patients with BrS, showing that RFA is associated with a substantial reduction in ICD shock in patients, as indicated by the pooled risk ratio of 0.13 (CI 95% 0.04–0.44; p‐value = .0010). However, the studies included show a high level of heterogeneity, indicated by an I\n2 value of 82% (p‐value <.00001) suggesting differences in the magnitude of the effect across the studies. Furthermore, the funnel plot indicates some degree of asymmetry, which may suggest the presence of publication bias or heterogeneity, especially among the smaller studies (Figure 3A).FIGURE 3Forest plot analysis of (A) implantable cardioverter‐defibrillator shocks event before and after ablation; and (B) subgroup analysis based on ablation site.In subgroup analysis, the overall pooled RR for epicardial ablation and endocardial ablation was 0.09 (95% CI 0.02–0.37; p‐value = .0007) and 0.44 (95% CI 0.17–1.12; p‐value = .09), which suggests a significant reduction in the event rates after epicardial ablation but not after endocardial ablation. However, the test for subgroup differences showed that there was no statistically significant difference between the epicardial and endocardial subgroups (χ2 = 3.37; p‐value = .07; I\n2 = 70.3%). Furthermore, the funnel plot also indicates some degree of asymmetry both in the epicardial and endocardial ablation groups, which may suggest the presence of publication bias or heterogeneity, especially among the smaller studies (Figure 3B).3.6ComplicationsBrugada et al. reported no complications. Nademanee et al. reported a serious periprocedural complication that occurred in four patients, who developed hemopericardium. Haïssaguerre et al. reported nine patients had one or two VF recurrences, and seven patients had more than two recurrences. Salghetti et al. reported one patient developed a left pneumothorax the day after the procedure, which was managed by pleural drainage. Nine patients developed pericarditis between 2 and 10 days after ablation. One patient experienced hematic cardiac tamponade. Li et al. reported that in the ICD group, 12 patients had recurrent VF episodes, resulting in multiple ICD shocks, and among them, two patients also experienced inappropriate ICD shocks. Manero et al. showed two patients had RVOT‐VT either during or after epicardial VT ablation, and in other cases, endocardial ablation failed three times to abolish VT‐VPB. Pappone et al. recorded one case of VT and one case of VF.3.7All‐cause mortalityNone of the included studies reported any deaths from any cause following the RDA procedure.4DISCUSSIONAn ECG ST elevation, a defining feature of transmural ischemia (damage affecting the complete thickness of the ventricle wall), results from this. By emphasizing variations in the resting membrane potential and action potentials across ischemic and nonischemic zones, depolarization theory offers a crucial explanation for ST elevation. Abnormalities in depolarization interfere with the myocardium's normal electrical impulse conduction, increasing the risk of arrhythmia and causing conduction delays. In patients with BrS, the arrhythmogenic substrate is characterized by highly localized epicardial abnormalities rather than diffuse repolarization changes. Sarcon et al.\n24\n demonstrated that, even in the absence of a spontaneous type‐1 ECG pattern, high‐density epicardial mapping consistently identifies regions of low‐voltage, fractionated electrograms, and late potentials confined to the anterior RVOT. These abnormal electrograms correlate directly with the coved‐type ST‐segment elevation, fragmented QRS complexes, and isolated late potentials observed on surface ECG. Moreover, these signals intensify with faster pacing and expand significantly after procainamide infusion, unmasking the Brugada phenotype.\n25\n Targeted radiofrequency ablation of these fractionated sites not only abolishes the late potentials and normalizes the ST segment but also prevents recurrent ventricular fibrillation, underscoring a depolarization‐driven mechanism that is uniquely manifest in BrS. Intraventricular conduction delay (IVCD), which is associated with heart failure and sudden cardiac death, and bundle branch block (BBB), which lengthens the QRS duration and results in ventricular dyssynchrony, are important symptoms. Ventricular arrhythmias are linked to fragmented QRS (fQRS), a sign of myocardial fibrosis, especially in ischemia and hypertrophic cardiomyopathies. Abnormalities in repolarization impact myocardial recovery and raise the risk of arrhythmias such as sudden cardiac death and torsades de pointes. While early repolarization syndrome (ERS), characterized by elevated J‐point, is associated with ventricular fibrillation, particularly in young people, a prolonged QT interval implies delayed repolarization, which is frequently caused by genetic mutations or drugs. In structural heart illness, T‐wave alternans (TWA) predicts sudden cardiac mortality and represents repolarization instability. Furthermore, ischemic or inflammatory heart disorders such as acute coronary syndromes, pericarditis, and myocarditis are indicated by ST‐segment deviations.\n26\n\nThe findings of this study underscore the therapeutic value of RFA in BrS, particularly in its ability to significantly reduce VA recurrence and ICD shocks. The reduction in VA recurrence and ICD shock rates following RFA underscores its clinical efficacy in managing Brugada syndrome (BrS)‐related arrhythmias. By effectively suppressing arrhythmic activity, RFA provides long‐term rhythm stability, suggesting that the procedure interrupts the abnormal electrical pathways responsible for life‐threatening events, which is essential for enhancing patient survival. Additionally, the decrease in ICD shocks highlights the procedure's role in reducing the frequency of device interventions, lessening patient distress and improving quality of life. With fewer shocks, RFA supports a more stable cardiac rhythm that minimizes ICD activation, offering significant benefits to patient comfort and psychological well‐being. This dual impact on both VA recurrence and ICD shock rates solidifies RFA as an effective strategy for promoting sustained rhythm control and improving overall outcomes in BrS management.\n27\n\nThese outcomes also likely stem from the ablation's direct targeting of the arrhythmogenic substrate in BrS, which is predominantly located in the right ventricular epicardium. The abnormal sodium channel function in BrS results in a transmural voltage gradient, leading to ST‐segment elevation and an increased susceptibility to VA. By ablating these epicardial regions, RFA disrupts the conduction pathways that foster reentrant arrhythmias, thereby reducing the incidence of recurrent VA.\n27\n A previous systematic review by Fernandes et al. (2018), which included 11 case series and 11 case reports, demonstrated that epicardial substrate modification appears to be a more effective strategy for preventing VT and VF than endocardial ablation alone. Persistent or recurrent J‐ST elevation was found to be indicative of unsuccessful ablation. For patients with VT/VF and BrS, ablation remains a reasonable therapeutic option.\n28\n A more recent systematic review by Kotake et al. (2023), comprising 15 case series and 41 case studies, similarly concluded that catheter ablation is an effective method for eliminating the arrhythmogenic substrate associated with BrS and related arrhythmias.\n29\n The novelty of our research is that we carried out a quantitative evaluation using meta‐analysis with a different number of studies. We specifically analyzed the long‐term effects of epicardial radiofrequency ablation and its benefits for recurrent ventricular arrhythmia in BrS.Unlike conventional ablation techniques, which target the endocardium (tissue inside the heart), epicardial RFA targets the epicardium (tissue outside the heart) to treat specific arrhythmias. When endocardial ablation fails to address the epicardial substrate, high‐volume centers routinely perform epicardial ablation for VT in both ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathies.\n30\n This mechanism explains the limitation of endocardial ablation success in reducing VA or ICD shocks because it does not directly address the epicardial abnormalities responsible for the arrhythmogenesis. The deeper myocardial layers accessed by endocardial ablation may not contain the critical electrophysiological disturbances seen in BrS, explaining the more modest impact on arrhythmia recurrence and device shocks. But because of the nature of the procedure, pericarditis is the most common complication, with operators frequently administering intrapericardial steroids to reduce its incidence. Other potential complications include damage to the liver or diaphragm, particularly when using the subxiphoid entry approach.\n31\n By decreasing the need for ICD interventions, RFA helps mitigate these secondary psychological effects, improving both physical and mental health outcomes for BrS patients. This reduction in ICD shocks can be attributed to the successful modification of the electrical circuits responsible for triggering VAs, further emphasizing RFA's role as an effective adjunctive treatment.Epicardial ablation is generally reserved for patients who have not responded to endocardial ablation, typically in high‐volume, specialized centers. Cooled irrigation techniques have been developed to prevent catheter tip overheating, ensuring sufficient RFA energy delivery during ablation. Early studies suggest that cooled or irrigated‐tip RFA produces larger epicardial lesions compared to standard 4‐mm RFA. Additionally, epicardial fat appears to be particularly well‐suited for irrigated ablation.\n32\n Endocardial ablation is used to target PVCs that cause VF, anatomically from the endocardium when ablation cannot be accomplished on the epicardial side because of the presence of coronary arteries or fat, or when targeting VT. This is the reasoning for endocardial ablation in BrS patients.\n19\n\nA proposed algorithm for the determination of invasive epicardial ablation, endocardial ablation, and ICD use in BrS patients can be seen in Figure 4. The figure illustrates the management strategy for BrS, a hereditary cardiac disorder that heightens the risk of severe arrhythmias, including VT and VF, which can result in SCD. The management approach is based on whether the patient exhibits symptoms (such as syncope or aborted cardiac arrest) or remains asymptomatic despite having characteristic ECG findings.\n33\n, \n34\n, \n35\n\nFIGURE 4Proposed algorithm for the determination of invasive epicardial ablation, endocardial ablation, and ICD use.\n33\n\nFor patients who are symptomatic, particularly those who have survived a SCD episode or experienced unexplained fainting, thorough evaluation is essential. If the ECG displays the typical type 1 Brugada pattern, the implantation of an ICD is highly recommended. This device continuously monitors heart activity and can deliver shocks to terminate life‐threatening arrhythmias. In instances where the type 1 pattern is only identified after administering Na channel blockers, further testing is conducted to assess the inducibility of arrhythmias through an electrophysiology study. If arrhythmias can be induced, ICD implantation is still advised. However, if no arrhythmias are provoked, close monitoring is suggested instead.In asymptomatic patients, if a spontaneous type 1 ECG pattern is observed, inducibility tests are performed to evaluate arrhythmia risk. Patients showing inducible VT/VF are deemed at higher risk and may benefit from ICD implantation, while those without inducible arrhythmias can be managed through vigilant monitoring. For asymptomatic individuals whose type 1 pattern appears only after Na channel blockers are administered, family history of SCD plays a crucial role in risk assessment. A family history of SCD increases perceived risk, potentially warranting ICD recommendation, especially if VT/VF can be induced. Conversely, in patients without such a history or if no arrhythmias are inducible, close follow‐up without immediate intervention is appropriate.\n36\n, \n37\n\nFor patients with an ICD who experience recurrent appropriate shocks because of ongoing arrhythmias, additional treatment options may be explored. Medications like Quinidine and procedures such as right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) ablation may be utilized to manage arrhythmias effectively. In severe cases where VF persists, especially when endocardial ablation fails or when arrhythmias affect the epicardial substrate, an epicardial ablation procedure may be conducted to target and eliminate the problematic areas of the heart.Based on this study, the inability to locate an RFA target and closeness to a coronary artery or the left phrenic nerve are the primary limitations of epicardial RFA. Epicardial access, mapping, and ablation can result in a special set of consequences, such as pericarditis, significant coronary artery damage, phrenic nerve injury, and hemopericardium. Patient safety depends on anticipating, avoiding, and, if required, addressing these issues. Delivery of epicardial RFA is restricted by fat or linked to phrenic nerve injury, coronary artery damage, hemorrhage, and extra‐cardiac damage.4.1Study limitationsThere is a limited number of studies directly comparing the risks and benefits between RFA and non‐RFA groups. Most available literature consists of case series or case reports, leading to potential biases and limited generalizability. We also observed a high degree of heterogeneity (I\n2 >80%) among the included studies. This variability may be attributed to several factors, such as differences in study design, patient demographics, baseline risk of ventricular arrhythmia, and variations in procedural techniques—including distinctions in operator expertise and follow‐up durations. In particular, geographic and genetic diversity among the study populations, as well as variations in the definitions and measurements of clinical outcomes, likely contributed to the observed heterogeneity. Additionally, research on RFA for BrS is not conducted uniformly across different regions, which may affect the representation of factors related to disease epidemiology and long‐term outcomes. Therefore, further research, particularly well‐designed comparative studies, is required to evaluate the long‐term effects of RFA versus non‐RFA treatments to achieve more comprehensive and globally representative results.5CONCLUSIONSFrom this study, RFA provides significant outcomes for improvement in BrS patients. There was a substantial decrease in the event rates of recurrent VA after epicardial ablation. Moreover, RFA is also related to a substantial decrease in ICD shock in patients. None of the included studies reported any deaths from any cause following the RFA procedure. These findings have important clinical implications for BrS management, suggesting that RFA should be considered a key therapeutic option for the patients. Despite the promising results, the presence of significant heterogeneity across studies raises questions about the variability in procedural techniques, patient selection, follow‐up durations, regional disparities in the study population, and the lack of randomized controlled trials.CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENTThe authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.PATIENT CONSENT STATEMENTNo human participant was involved in this study."}

This increases the overall sample size and enhances the reliability of synthesized clinical evidence.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s12672-025-02703-z.", "body": "IntroductionTo compare the efficacies of treatments for cancer, clinical trials usually require long-term follow-up [1]. In such scenarios, traditional efficacy indicators, such as odds ratios and relative risks, become less applicable because evaluating treatments involves not only determining whether a specific event, such as disease progression or death, has occurred but also considering the time until these events occur. Therefore, survival analysis, which combines the observation of events with the time experienced, is considered the most appropriate statistical method for these clinical trials [2].Survival analysis involves the collection of survival data, including endpoint events (e.g., disease progression, death, or other events of interest), survival time, and censoring (e.g., loss to follow-up, withdrawal from the trial, or failure to complete the endpoint event) [2]. These survival data can be summarized into a life table and then presented more intuitively in the form of Kaplan–Meier (KM) curves, often accompanied by a hazard ratio (HR) [3, 4]. The HR is defined as the ratio of the hazards, representing the instantaneous risk conditional on no prior events, averaged over the observed event times [4].Often, multiple similar clinical trials are conducted simultaneously or sequentially to compare the same treatments for the same caner. However, due to limitations such as small sample sizes, the influence of various confounding factors, and differences in study designs, the HRs for the same treatment reported by different clinical trials may be inconsistent or even contradictory [4]. To obtain a widely accepted and robust conclusion, meta-analyses are commonly performed to pool HRs across multiple trials [5]. This process collects existing or unpublished studies with comparable characteristics and integrates the results into a quantified combined effect estimate [5]. However, some studies do not report HRs, leading to incomplete synthesis of clinical evidence for meta-analysis. Several investigators have developed their own approaches to estimate HRs from KM curves to facilitate meta-analysis, but these methods can be complex [6–9].To estimate HRs from studies that reported the KM curves but do not provide HRs, we developed a new, simple approach to estimate HRs by reconstructing life tables from KM curves, particularly for small clinical trials. This approach increases the number of studies included in the meta-analysis, thereby enhancing the reliability of the pooled HR and providing a more accurate reflection of the efficacies of treatments for cancer.MethodsWorkflow of constructing life table, plotting KM curve, and calculating HRIn this section, we briefly describe the standard workflow for constructing a life table, plotting a KM curve, and calculating the HR in a clinical trial. This will enhance the understanding of the methodology we developed to estimate HRs.Suppose that a clinical trial evaluating the efficacies of certain treatments for cancer has been completed. During the follow-up, death or censoring occurred i times in total, with corresponding time points denoted as Ti. Note that each time death or censoring occurs, the number of deaths (Di) or censored patients (Ci) should be ≥ 1.

Based on Ti, Di, and Ci, the values of Ni, Pi, and Si can be calculated. This table demonstrates how to construct the life table for a clinical trialFor better visualization of survival, the KM curve, a series of declining horizontal steps, can be plotted based on the Ti and Si values from the life table (Fig. 1A) [3, 10]. The parameters in the life table can be understood from the perspective of the KM curve as follows: The follow-up time is divided into a series of steps corresponding to i time intervals [0, T1], (T1, T2], (T2, T3], …, (Ti-1, Ti] for i ≥ 1 [11]. These time intervals are defined such that at least one patient either died or was censored at the end of the interval (i.e., at time point Ti of each interval (Ti-1, Ti]). Di and Ci represent the numbers at the end of the interval. Ni represents the number at the start of the interval (i.e., at time point Ti-1 of each interval (Ti-1, Ti]).Fig. 1Workflow of constructing life table, plotting KM curve, and calculating HR. A Example of a standard KM curve. The endpoint of each declining horizontal step (i.e., the end of each time interval) represents dead patients. Vertical tick-marks represent censored patients. T, Time; S, Survival rate; C, Censored patients; i, Number. B Example of survival data input into SPSS. For the outcome variable, 1 represents death, and 2 represents censoring. For the group variable, 1 and 2 represent different groups according to the design of the clinical trial. C Kaplan–Meier analysis in SPSS. In the ‘Kaplan–Meier’ dialog box, the variables ‘Time’, ‘Status’, and ‘Factor’ were set as the data for ‘Time’, ‘Outcome’, and ‘Group’, respectively. In the ‘Define Event’ dialog box, ‘Single value’ was set to 1, representing death. In the ‘Options’ dialog box, ‘Survival’ was additionally selected. D Cox regression analysis in SPSS. In the ‘Cox regression’ dialog box, the variables ‘Time’, ‘Status’, and ‘Covariates’ were set as the data for ‘Time’, ‘Outcome’, and ‘Group’, respectively. In the ‘Categorical’ dialog box, ‘Categorical covariates’ was set to ‘Group (Indicator)’. In the ‘Define Event’ dialog box, ‘Single value’ was set to 1, representing death. In the ‘Options’ dialog box, ‘CI for exp(B) 95%’ was selectedThe survival data of patients, i.e., the values of Ti, Di, and Ci in the life table, can be input into SPSS (IBM, v25) (Fig. 1B). Then, the KM curve is plotted using the Kaplan–Meier method (Fig. 1C). The HR is calculated using the Cox regression method (Fig. 1D).Extraction of Ti and Si from the KM curveFor the clinical trials that only reported the KM curves without presenting HRs, if the values of Ti and Si can be extracted from the KM curve and combined with Eqs. (1–3), the values of Ti, Di, and Ci in the life table could be reversely derived, and the HR can be estimated accordingly. In the subsequent sections, we will elaborate on the procedures of our methodology.The KM curve is plotted with Ti values as x-axis coordinates and Si values as y-axis coordinates, where vertical tick-marks indicate censored patients (Fig. 1A) [3]. The coordinates of the endpoints at the end of each time interval and the coordinates of all the tick-marks on the KM curve are extracted using Engauge Digitizer (github.com/markummitchell/engauge-digitizer/releases, v12.1). Briefly, the x-axis and y-axis are defined by mouse-clicking the start and end points of each axis in the KM plot. Then, all endpoints and tick-marks are selected by clicking to be read off from the curve. The resulting Ti and Si coordinates are then exported for the reverse derivations of parameters in the life table.Reverse derivation of parameters in the life tableAn empty life table is created in the Excel (Microsoft, v2406) sheet, and the Ti and Si coordinates are input into it (Fig. 2A).Fig. 2Workflow for the reverse derivation of parameters in the life table. A Input the Ti and Si coordinates into the Excel spreadsheet. B Input the pre-assumed values of Ci and calculation of the values of Si. C Calculation of the values of N1, D1, and N2. D Auto fill of the remaining values of Di and Ni.

values of Ti and Si can be extracted from the KM curve. Based on Ti and Si, the values of Pi, Ni, and Di can be calculated. This table demonstrates how to reconstruct the life table through reverse derivation of parameters within the life tableRules to reconstruct the life tableDuring the above process to reconstruct the life table, 3 rules should be followed.First, although one tick-mark on the KM curve may indicate several patients censored at the same time point Tx (where 1 ≤ x ≤ i), the number of censored patients Cx corresponding to the tick-mark will be set as 1 a priori. This assumption is reasonable for small clinical trials because the number of censored patients is usually very small. This setting ensures that the values of Dx+m (where m = 1, 2, 3, …) representing the number of deaths at the following m time intervals after (Tx-1, Tx] are close to integers. If they are not, Cx will be increased to 2 or more, termed a sensitivity test, until the values of Dx+m are close to integers.Second, in cases where the steps of the KM curve decline too rapidly over a very short period, the values of Di are still not close to integers after the sensitivity test. This is typically due to too many steps clustering within relatively short time intervals, which makes the manually extracted coordinates inevitably deviate from the actual numbers. Therefore, if the consistent sum of Dx, Dx+1, …, Dx+m across m + 1 time intervals, \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\sum_{k=x}^{x+m}{D}_{k}$$\\end{document}∑k=xx+mDk, is near an integer, it will be acceptable to combine these short steps as a whole step, meaning that \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\sum_{k=x}^{x+m}{D}_{k}$$\\end{document}∑k=xx+mDk patients died at time point Tx+m.

The study reported that 24 patients were included at the start of the trial in both groups. At the end of the trial, 19 deaths were observed in the surgery group and 24 deaths in the chemotherapy group. However, no numbers of censored patients or risk patients were reported.Fig. 3Original and reconstructed KM curves. A, B, Original (A) and reconstructed (B) KM curves of Example 1.

The orginial study reported the number of risk patients but did not mark censored patients with tick-marks on the KM curves (E). We rebuilt the tick-marks based on the table of risk patients (F). All the reconstructed KM curves (B, D, G) match the original ones (A, C, E) in sizeFrom Fig. 3A, the x-axis coordinates (Ti) and y-axis coordinates (Si) of the endpoints at the end of each time interval and all tick-marks on the KM curves were extracted (Table S1, left panel). Then, the values of Ti and Si were filled into the ‘Time’ and ‘Survival Rate’ columns of the reconstructed life tables (Table S1, middle panel), respectively. According to the 1st rule for reconstructing the life tables outlined in the Methods, Ci values corresponding to each tick-mark were set as 1 a priori, and the values of other parameters were calculated based on Eqs. (1), (5), and (6) (Table S1, middle panel). A sensitivity test was performed by increasing Ci to 2 or more due to non-integer values for D3, D4, D6, D7, D13, and D14 in the surgery group, which remained non-integer afterward. This indicated that adjusting the values of Ci could not resolve the issue. Subsequently, according to the 2nd rule, D3 and D4, which were initially 0.6327 and 1.3470, were changed to 0 and 2, respectively, indicating that no patients died at 10.6282 months and 2 patients died at 11.2557 months (Table S1, middle panel). Similar adjustments were made for D6, D7, D13, and D14. Then, the reconstructed life tables were modified by changing all Di values to integers (Table S1, middle panel). According to the 3rd rule, the recalculated total numbers of deaths (19 in the surgery group and 24 in the chemotherapy group) were verified to be consistent with the original numbers reported in the study [12]. Finally, the survival data from the modified life tables were input into SPSS (Table S1, right panel).The reconstructed KM curves of Example 1 are shown in Fig. 3B. The estimated HR was 0.510 (95% CI 0.272–0.958, P = 0.036), whereas the original HR was 0.51 (95% CI 0.27–0.96, P = 0.04) [12]. The deviation of the estimated HR from the original HR was 0.Estimate HRs from clinical trials reporting risk patientsExample 2 (Fig. 3C, i.e., Fig. 2a of Zhu [13]) includes KM curves depicting the overall survival of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, comparing those who underwent transarterial chemoembolization combined with sorafenib (TACE + sorafenib group) to those who underwent TACE alone (TACE group) [13]. The study reported that 46 patients were included in the TACE + sorafenib group and 45 patients in the TACE group at the start of the trial. At the end of the trial, 37 deaths were observed in the TACE + sorafenib group and 43 deaths in the TACE group. The numbers of risk patients were reported (Risk patients in Fig. 3C), but the numbers of censored patients were not.From Fig. 3C, the values of Ti and Si were extracted and filled into the reconstructed life tables (Table S2, left panel). Ci values were set as 1 a priori, and then the values of other parameters within the life tables were calculated (Table S2, middle panel). However, the calculated values of D16-D18 were not close to integers when C15 was 1 in the TACE + sorafenib group. A sensitivity test was performed by increasing C15 up to 3, resulting in D16 being close to 1, D17 close to 3, and D18 close to 0 (Table S2, middle panel). Then, the reconstructed life tables were modified by changing all Di values to integers (Table S2, middle panel). The recalculated total numbers of deaths (37 in the TACE + sorafenib group, 43 in the TACE group) and the numbers of risk patients at different timepoints (Table S2, middle panel) were verified to be consistent with the original numbers reported in the study [13]. Finally, the survival data from the modified life tables were input into SPSS (Table S2, right panel).The reconstructed KM curves of Example 2 are shown in Fig. 3D. The estimated HR was 2.472 (95% CI 1.548–3.949, P < 0.001), whereas the original HR was 2.33 (95% CI 1.45–3.73, P < 0.001) [13]. The deviation of the estimated HR from the original HR was 6.09%.Estimate HRs from clinical trials reporting risk patients but losing censoring informationExample 3 (Fig. 3E, i.e., Fig. 3b of Tanis [14]) includes KM curves depicting progression free survival of patients with liver metastases after colorectal surgery, comparing those with high CD3+ lymphocyte density at the tumour-normal interface (high CD3+ group) to those with low CD3+ lymphocyte density (low CD3+ group) [14]. The study reported that 21 patients were included in the high CD3+ group and 23 in the low CD3+ group at the start of the trial. The numbers of risk patients were reported (Risk patients in Fig. 3E), but the numbers of deaths or censored patients were not.From Fig. 3E, the life tables were reconstructed (Table S3) as usual. However, the numbers of risk patients generated from these life tables (Table S3, right panel) were inconsistent with the table of risk patients reported in the study (Fig. 3E) [14]. We then realized that the authors did not mark censored patients with tick-marks on the KM curves. We rebuilt the tick-marks based on the table of risk patients (Fig. 3F). From Fig. 3F, the values of Ti and Si were extracted and filled into the reconstructed life tables (Table S4, left panel). Guided by the table of risk patients, C11, C14, C15, and C16 in the high CD3+ group were easily set as 3, 3, and 1, respectively, and C18 and C19 in the low CD3+ group were both set as 2. Then, the values of other parameters within the life tables were calculated (Table S4, middle panel). A sensitivity test was unnecessary since all the calculated Di values were close to integers in both groups. Then, the reconstructed life tables were modified by changing all Di values to integers (Table S4, middle panel). The numbers of risk patients at different timepoints (Table S4, middle panel) were verified to be consistent with the original numbers reported in the study [14]. Finally, the survival data of the modified life tables were input into SPSS (Table S4, right panel).The reconstructed KM curves of Example 3 are shown in Fig. 3G. The estimated HR was 0.591 (95% CI 0.291–1.199, P = 0.145), whereas the original HR was 0.62 (95% CI 0.31–1.26, P = 0.180) [14]. The deviation of the estimated HR from the original HR was 4.68%.More examplesTo eliminate selection bias, we estimated additional HRs from several small clinical trials [15–18] using this approach. The deviations of the estimated HRs from the original ones ranged from 0.21 to 2.29% (Table S5), suggesting good repeatability and accuracy.DiscussionThis study develops a new, simple approach to estimate HR by reconstructing life tables from KM curves, particularly for small survival studies. Utilizing this approach, the reliability of meta-analysis can be enhanced by pooling more clinical trials, even those that do not report HRs, thereby generating more accurate synthesized clinical outcomes.Several studies have proposed methods to estimate HRs from KM curves [6–9]. Parmar et al. assumed that censoring was uniform across the entire follow-up period, patient information was collected at regular time intervals, and there was minimal missing information on the endpoint [6]. However, this assumption ignored the true follow-up status of clinical trials. Williamson et al. relied on the proportional hazards regression assumption [7], which may not be accessible to beginners unfamiliar with Cox regression equations. Tierney et al. estimated censoring using the minimum and maximum follow-up periods [8], but this approach discarded some survival information. Previous investigators [6–8] extracted limited time points from the KM curves, whereas we, along with Guyot et al. [9], utilized all available time points to preserve complete survival information. In contrast, while Guyot et al. [9] employed R programming for their method, our approach is notably simpler, relying on user-friendly software with a graphical interface, such as Excel and SPSS.Additionally, our approach reconstructs life tables and simulates the process of constructing the KM curves, making it easy to understand. Moreover, unlike the complex equations used by previous investigators [6–9] to estimate log(HR) and its variance, our approach calculates parameters within the life table based on the time points (Ti) and survival rates (Si) of the KM curves using simple Eqs. (1), (5), and (6) in Excel, making the process highly convenient. While studies that do not report HRs may be considered less rigorously conducted, when only a few clinical trials address a specific clinical issue, using our approach to estimate HRs for meta-analysis can still provide scientific significance.Our study has limitations. First, our approach is based on the low-censoring assumption (the 1st rule for reconstructing life tables in the Methods). In clinical trials with high censoring rates, or when KM curves lack markings for censored patients or do not provide a risk patient table, the number of censored patients is difficult to estimate, and our approach may produce suboptimal results. Second, although our approach can theoretically estimate HRs from KM curves of any sample size, in practice, the coordinates of adjacent declining horizontal steps in KM curves with large sample sizes are often too close to be accurately extracted. These two limitations restrict the applicability of our approach primarily to small clinical trials. Based on our experience, parameter optimization for life table reconstruction becomes challenging when the sample size per group exceeds 50. Thus, in this context, we consider a ‘small’ clinical trial as one with fewer than 50 patients per group. Third, high-resolution publication of KM curves is required so that the declining steps remain clearly identifiable even when the curve is enlarged. Errors in extracting Ti and Si coordinates may occur due to poor publication quality of the curve or carelessness during point extraction. Therefore, each coordinate should be manually verified, which is time-consuming. Nevertheless, since coordinates are manually extracted, deviations from their true values remain unavoidable, regardless of the resolution of the KM curve or the level of care taken during extraction. These limitations are also common challenges faced by other similar studies [6–9].In conclusion, our study proposed a new, simple approach to estimate HRs from published KM curves for small survival studies without reported HRs. This approach will help researchers to include small trials in meta-analysis and increase the sample size and reliability of synthesized clinical evidence.Supplementary Information\nSupplementary file1 (XLSX 43 KB)"}
{"PMCID": "11907471", "title": "Clinical and hemodynamic outcomes of self-expanding and balloon-expandable valves for valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve implantation (ViV-TAVI): An updated systematic review and meta-analysis", "abstract": "Graphical abstract", "body": "1IntroductionBioprosthetic valves for surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) are increasingly preferred over mechanical valves in recent years, particularly in the middle-aged population [1]. This is primarily driven by patient’s desire to avoid life-long warfarin therapy, bleeding risks, and thrombotic complications [2]. However, structural deterioration of the bio-prosthesis is relatively common, which requires surgical aortic valve reoperation for the failing bio-prosthesis [3]. The valve-in-valve (ViV) transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has emerged as a safe, and feasible alternative to conventional reoperative SAVR in high-risk patients, with comparable safety, efficacy, and clinical outcomes in lower-risk patients [4], [5], [6].Balloon-expandable valve (BEV) and self-expanding valve (SEV) are the two valves utilized for the ViV-TAVI procedure. These two types of valves might have different clinical efficacy, and rates of adverse complications including paravalvular leak, conduction block, or post-procedural transvalvular pressure gradient owing to their difference in deployment mechanism, radial force, valve height, and valve geometry [7], [8]. Although SEV and BEV are the two valves used for ViV-TAVI, most ViV-TAVI analyses have not been sub-grouped by valve type. There is only one randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing the two types of valves, and only a few observational studies have been published, mostly single-center, with limited sample size leading to lower statistical power and inconsistent findings, that cannot be generalized. Extensive cohort studies evaluating registry data exist but are comparatively outdated. The recently published first-ever RCT, the Lyten trial [9] showed that ViV-TAVI with SEV was associated with better valve hemodynamics with no differences in all-cause mortality or stroke at 30 days. Hence, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the most recent studies to evaluate the clinical outcomes of the transcatheter valve types for ViV patients.2MethodsWe conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis following the methods established by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) [10], [11], Cochrane, and Assessing the methodological quality of systematic reviews-2 (AMSTAR-2) guidelines [12]. Institutional board approval was not required as the data used in this study were publicly available, and with prior institutional review board approval.2.1Literature search strategyWe performed a systematic search of the PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus databases, and Boolean operators-based PRISMA search strategy using PICO (patient, intervention, comparison, outcomes)-based research questionnaire. Boolean Operators ““OR”” and ““AND”” were utilized among synonymous, and different keywords/Medical subject headings (MeSH) terms. The following keywords were used for the search: “(valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve implantation OR valve-in-valve TAVI OR ViV-TAVI OR valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve replacement OR valve-in-valve TAVR OR ViV-TAVR) AND (self-expandable OR self-expanding OR balloon-expandable). A detailed description of the complete search strategy for each database is given in Table S1. We systematically searched for all studies reporting outcomes for ViV-TAVI by SE/BE valve type from inception till August 2024. RCTs and observational studies that compared the mortality, and safety outcomes between BEV and SEV among patients undergoing ViV-TAVI for failed surgical bio-prosthesis were also included in the present analysis. We applied no filters based on language, year of publication, author name, and institution/country of publication. We additionally performed manual searches through reference lists of original publications, review articles, and pertinent editorials. Google Scholar, medrix.org, and ClinicalTrials.gov were also searched to identify grey literature, and preprints.2.2Study selection and eligibility criteriaAll articles retrieved from the systematic search were exported to EndNote X9 Reference Manager (Clarivate Analytics, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) where duplicates were removed among different online databases. Two independent investigators (FY and AM) performed an initial screening of the remaining articles based on the title and abstract that met the study population. Finally, full texts were evaluated for relevance. Any discrepancies were resolved by discussion with the third investigator (KI). The search was restricted to the following inclusion criteria: (1) a minimum of 10 patients undergoing ViV-TAVI for failed surgical bio-prosthesis; (2) safety, and clinical outcomes stratified by the two currently available valve types “Edwards Lifesciences LLC, Irvine, CA” for BEV, and “Medtronic Inc, Minneapolis, MN” for SEV either as a direct comparison or for single-valve; (3) patients followed-up for a minimum of 30 days. The BEV group predominantly represented the SAPIEN valves, and the SEV group largely consisted of Evolut devices. Studies were excluded in cases of study cohort overlapping with another study including subgroup analysis of the main study, devices other than Edwards Lifesciences valves and Medtronic valves, and ViV performed for failed transcatheter aortic valves.2.3Data extraction and quality assessmentTwo investigators (FY and AM) independently abstracted data from the shortlisted articles using pre-specified collection forms. In addition to the population, and trial characteristics, data on primary and secondary outcomes were extracted. Study-level characteristics included author name, year of publication, country of publication, number of hospitals, and number of patients included. Baseline patient characteristics included age, STS-PROM score (Society of Thoracic Surgeons- Predicted Risk of Mortality score), Logistic EuroSCORE (European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation), devices used, type of failing valve (stented/stent-less), time since SAVR, failure type (aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, mixed), NYHA (New York Heart Association) Class III/IV, and LVEF% (left ventricular ejection fraction). The primary outcome for this analysis was incidence of all-cause mortality at 30 days. Secondary outcomes included incidence of 1-year mortality, new permanent pacemaker implantation and 30-day safety outcomes including stroke, acute kidney injury, coronary obstruction, major bleeding, and major vascular complications.We also analyzed 3-year all-cause mortality among patients receiving BEV vs SEV. We compared hemodynamic outcomes such as mean transvalvular gradients during the post-procedural period, at 30 days and 1 year; maximal transvalvular gradients at 30 days and 1 year; the proportion of patients with a mean residual gradient > 20 mmHg during the post-procedural period and at 30 days; the proportion of patients with a severe patient-prosthesis mismatch; the proportion of patients with a moderate to severe aortic regurgitation (AR) in the post-procedural period, 30 days and 1 year; mean LVEF at 30 days and 1 year; and proportion of patients with at least moderate paravalvular leak (PVL) during the post-procedural period, at 30 days and 1 year. The methodological quality assessment of the included observational studies was performed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS) [13]. The NOS is scored by awarding a point for each question across the three domains i.e., selection, comparability, and outcome or exposure with studies scoring a maximum of 9 points. Nonrandomized studies scoring 7 or greater were graded as ‘high quality’ in our analysis. The quality assessment of the included RCTs was performed using the Risk of Bias (ROB) 2.0 Cochrane tool, [14] which assesses bias as a judgement of high, low, and unclear risk of bias for individual elements across six domains, including selection, performance, detection, attrition, reporting, and other.2.4Statistical analysisWe performed the statistical analysis using Review Manager (RevMan) V.5.3 Cochrane Collaboration, London, United Kingdom and R version 4.0.3. Publication bias was ascertained for the outcome of all-cause mortality by generating a funnel plot and confirming the bias by Egger’s regression test. Data were presented as incidence of outcomes, analyzed via random effects model using inverse variance method with 95 % confidence intervals. Further incidence rates of primary and secondary outcomes were presented as subgroups of SE and BE, with comparison between incidence rates between the subgroups made using p-interaction of proportions. The Higgins I-squared (I2) statistical model was used to assess variations in outcomes of the included studies whereby I2 = 25 %-50 % was considered mild, 50 %-75 % as moderate, and greater than 75 % as severe heterogeneity [15]. The probability value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. For outcomes with high heterogeneity, we used sensitivity analyses using meta-inf module to evaluate studies contributing the most to heterogeneity. We performed a multivariate meta-regression to investigate the effects of potential effect modifiers using random effects models for study variance and Knapp–Hartung modification [16], [17].3Results3.1Study selection and characteristicsA total of 545 articles were obtained from the initial electronic database search that were subsequently assessed for inclusion based on the eligibility criteria. A detailed search strategy utilized for each database is shown in Table S1. After removing duplicate and irrelevant studies, 264 articles were screened. A further 218 articles were excluded, and 27 studies [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44] were ultimately included in this meta-analysis. PRISMA flow diagram depicts the study selection process in Fig. 1.Fig. 1PRISMA Flow Diagram.3.2Study characteristics, quality assessment, and publication biasTable 1 highlights the baseline demographics of the patient population included in the meta-analysis. A total of 13,182 patients undergoing ViV-TAVI were included in the analysis; 7,346 patients were in the SE valve group, while 5,836 patients were in the BE valve group. The mean age of the study population ranged from 62.8 years to 83.9 years with no significant difference between the BE vs. SE valve groups (SMD = −0.23 [-0.61 to + 0.14]; p = 0.23). The mean STS score was 8.46 in the SEV group while the mean STS of the BEV group was 7.65 (SMD = −0.12 [-0.83 to + 0.57]; p = 0.72). The mean pre-procedural LVEF in the SEV group was 52.09 % while the mean pre-procedural LVEF in the BEV group was 51.84 % (SMD = 0.13 [-0.01 to + 0.28]; p = 0.078). Regarding the SEV group, a total of 6355 (86.5 %) patients underwent transfemoral access for ViV-TAVI. Regarding the BEV group, in about 5417 (92.8 %) patients, transfemoral access was used for ViV-TAVI. The mean time since initial SAVR was 11.2 years in the SEV group vs. 11.01 years in the BEV group. A detailed description of procedural characteristics of the included studies appears in Table S2. The type of index surgical valve in the included studies appears in Table S3.Table 1General characteristics of the studies included in the meta-analysis (n = 27).Author,

the 26 cohort studies, the Newcastle-Ottawa scale showed 16 studies to be of high quality (score 7 or above).

The study had a low risk-of-bias in all five domains due to its robust methodology.\nFig. S1 display the methodological quality assessment in detail.The funnel plot of all-cause mortality at 30 days shows no significant publication bias (Fig. S2).3.3Primary outcomeThe pooled event rate of 30-day mortality for the BE valve group, reported by nine studies, was 4 % (95 % CI: 0.02–0.07). The pooled event rate of 30-day mortality for the SE valve group, reported by 17 studies, was 3 % (95 % CI: 0.03–0.04). No significant differences in 30-day mortality were found between SE and BE valve groups (p = 0.44) (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Forest plot for 30-day mortality.3.4Secondary OutcomesSeven studies reported the event rate of 1-y ear mortality for the BE valve group, and 14 studies reported these data for the SE valve group. No significant differences were found between SE and BE valves regarding 1-year mortality (BE: 12 %, 95 % CI, 0.07–0.21 vs. SE: 10 %, 95 % CI, 0.08–0.13; p = 0.60) (Fig. 3). Pooled analysis of 12 studies for the BE valve group and 18 studies for the SE valve group reported a significantly higher event rate of new permanent pacemaker insertion in the SE valve group compared with the BE valve group (BE: 4 %, 95 % CI, 0.03–0.05 vs. SE: 9 %, 95 % CI, 0.06–0.12; p = 0.0019) (Fig. 4).Fig. 3Forest plot for 1-year mortality.Fig. 4Forest plot for permanent pacemaker insertion.3.5Safety outcomesThere were no significant differences between the SE and BE valve groups in the event rate of 30-day safety outcomes, including stroke (BE: 2 %, 95 % CI, 0.02–0.03 vs. SE: 2 %, 95 % CI, 0.02–0.02; p = 0.99) (Fig. 5A), acute kidney injury (BE: 4 %, 95 % CI, 0.01–0.11 vs. SE: 4 %, 95 % CI, 0.03–0.05; p = 0.99) (Fig. 5B), major bleeding (BE: 4 %, 95 % CI, 0.01–0.13 vs. SE: 6 %, 95 % CI, 0.04–0.10; p = 0.56) (Fig. 6A), major vascular complications (BE: 4 %, 95 % CI, 0.01–0.11 vs. SE: 4 %, 95 % CI, 0.02–0.07p = 0.99) (Fig. 6B), and coronary obstruction (BE: 4 %, 95 % CI, 0.01–0.12 vs. SE: 2 %, 95 % CI, 0.01–0.04; p = 0.49) (Fig. 6C).Fig. 5(A) Forest plot for 30-day stroke, and (B) acute kidney injury.Fig. 6Forest plot for 30-day major bleeding (A), major vascular complications (B), and coronary obstruction (C).3.6Hemodynamic resultsThere was no significant difference regarding mean transvalvular gradient in patients receiving BEV compared with SEV in the post-procedural period (BE = 16.3 mmHg, 95 % CI, 12.71 – 20.96 vs. SE 15.6 mmHg, 95 % CI, 13.41 – 18.23). However, the mean transvalvular gradient was lower in SEV compared with BEV at 30 days (BE = 19.4 mmHg, 95 % CI, 17.6 – 21.52 vs. SE 14.74 mmHg, 95 % CI, 12.73 – 17.07) and at 1 year (BE = 18.7 mmHg, 95 % CI, 17.7 – 19.89 vs. SE 13.8 mmHg, 95 % CI, 11.9 – 15.91). Regarding maximal transvalvular gradient, there was no significant difference between BEV and SEV at 30 days (BE = 29.9 mmHg, 95 % CI, 23.5 – 38 vs. SE 24.7 mmHg, 95 % CI, 20.6 – 29.7), but the maximal transvalvular gradient in SEV patients was lower at 1 year compared with BEV patients (BE = 33.7 mmHg, 95 % CI, 32.1 – 35.3 vs. SE 24.5 mmHg, 95 % CI, 19.7 – 30.5). The proportion of patients with a mean residual gradient > 20 mmHg during the post-procedural period was not statistically different between BEV vs. SEV patients in the post-procedure period (BE = 43 %, 95 % CI, 0.27 – 0.61 vs. SE = 22 %, 95 % CI, 0.05 – 0.59) or at 30 days (BE = 36 %, 95 % CI, 0.14 – 0.65 vs. SE = 23 %, 95 % CI, 0.16 – 0.33).The proportion of patients with a severe patient-prosthesis mismatch was significantly lower in SEV compared with BEV (BE = 51 %, 95 % CI, 0.4 – 0.62 vs. SE = 25 %, 95 % CI, 0.16 – 0.37). The proportion of patients with moderate to severe AR among BEV vs. SEV patients was not significant in either the post-procedural period (BE = 0 %, 95 % CI, 0 – 0.15 vs. SE = 3 %, 95 % CI, 0.02 – 0.07), at 30 days (BE = 2 %, 95 % CI, 0.01 – 0.04 vs. SE = 3 %, 95 % CI, 0.02 – 0.06) or at 1 year (BE = 1 %, 95 % CI, 0.01 – 0.02 vs. SE = 3 %, 95 % CI, 0.02 – 0.04). Regarding mean LVEF among BEV vs. SEV patients, no significant difference was found at either 30 days (BE = 53 %, 95 % CI, 51 – 55 vs. SE 52.5 %, 95 % CI, 49.6 – 55.64) or at 1 year (BE = 56.3, 95 % CI, 53.3 – 59.4 vs. SE 56.7 %, 95 % CI, 54 – 59.5). The proportion of patients with a paravalvular leak was not statistically different among BEV vs. SEV patients during the post-procedural period (BE = 1 %, 95 % CI, 0.0 – 0.07 vs. SE = 5 %, 95 % CI, 0.02 – 0.13) or at 30 days (BE = 1 %, 95 % CI, 0.0 – 0.06 vs. SE = 6 %, 95 % CI, 0.02 – 0.21). However, BEV had a slightly lower statistically significant proportion of patients compared with SEV with paravalvular leak at 1 year (BE = 1 %, 95 % CI, 0.00 – 0.01 vs. SE = 4 %, 95 % CI, 0.02 – 0.1).3.73-year clinical outcomes3-year all-cause mortality was not statistically significant among BEV patients compared with SEV patients (BE = 31 %, 95 % CI, 0.27 – 0.36 vs. SE = 56 %, 95 % CI, 0.23 – 0.84).\nHeterogeneity:\nAll the outcomes except 30-day stroke, coronary obstruction, 1-year aortic regurgitation, post-procedural aortic regurgitation, and proportion of patients with a mean residual gradient > 20 mmHg in BEV showed significant heterogeneity. For 30-d ay mortality, removing Dvir et al. [28] reduced the incidence in BEV population to 2 % (95 % CI, 0.0239 – 0.0298), changing the incidence in BEV population to be significantly less compared with the SEV population (p-value < 0.05). For 30-day AKI, removing Kaneko et al. [21] changed the results in BEV population to 6 % (95 % CI, 0.05 – 0.7), but the difference between BEV and SEV remained non-significant. For post-procedural paravalvular leak, omitting Dallan et al. [43] reduced heterogeneity to 16.5 %, but the results were still non-significant for SEV population = 7 % (95 % CI, 0.04 – 0.12). For paravalvular leak at 1 year, removing the stent-less population in Choi et al. [33] reduced heterogeneity to 35.7 %. This reduced the incidence of 1-year paravalvular leak in the SEV population to 1.65 %, (95 % CI, 0.02 – 0.1) making the difference between BEV vs. SEV from previously significant to now non-significant (p-value > 0.05). For all other outcomes, all studies contributed equally to heterogeneity. The reasons for heterogeneity could be explained by the observational nature of these studies and sampling bias.\nMultivariate Meta-regression:\nWe conducted multivariate meta-regression against the baseline variables of age, STS score, and baseline LVEF for all clinical and hemodynamic outcomes. The results appear in Table S5.4DiscussionTo our knowledge, the current meta-analysis including over 13,000 patients, is the largest to-date study comparing the efficacy and safety of BEV and SEV outcomes in patients with failed aortic valve bio-prosthesis. The main findings of this meta-analysis have been demonstrated in Fig. 7. No significant differences were found between SE vs. BE valves with regard to 30-day mortality, 1-yaer mortality, and moderate-to-severe AR at 1 year. However, patients with SE valves had higher rates of new permanent pacemaker insertion than those with BE valves. Additionally, there were no significant differences between SE vs. BE valves in the incidence of 30-day safety outcomes, including stroke, AKI, coronary obstruction, major bleeding, and major vascular complications. Post‐TAVI permanent pacemaker insertion (PPI) is a complication related to increased length of stay, rehospitalizations, and other associated cost burdens [45]. This analysis is in line with previously conducted meta-analysis [46], [47] suggesting that patients with the SE valve had a significantly higher rate of new PPI compared with the BE valve group. A study indicated lower rates of permanent pacemaker insertion with the utilization of an annular plane projection technique following ViV-TAVI with SE valves [48]. Hence, individualized valve choice, and optimal implantation technique are imperative to reduce pacemaker rates. Future large-scale multi-center studies are required to assess the effectiveness of the method for implantation of SE valves [48].Vascular complications are traditionally associated with poor outcomes such as increased hospitalization, morbidity, and mortality [49], [50]. These results indicated no significant difference between SE and BE valves for major bleeding events. Our results show a low incidence of major vascular complication with both valve types, and no significant differences between the two groups (BE vs SE: 4 % vs 4 %). These rates are lower than the CHOICE trial, which indicated significant vascular complication rates of 9.9 % and 11.1 % with the BE and SE valves (p = 0.76), respectively. Another study conducted by Tham et al. also demonstrated a low incidence of major vascular complications with both valves, and no significant differences between the two groups (2.9 % SE vs. 4.9 % BE, p = 0.52). These reduced rates of vascular complications with both valve types can be attributed to the recent use of newer generation valve systems with smaller sheath diameters, enhanced preoperative vascular screening utilizing multislice spiral computed tomography (MSCT), intraprocedural balloon crossover techniques, and ultrasound guidance for femoral access [51].Stroke is a severe complication primarily occurring in the peri-procedural phase and within 30 days after TAVR. The frequency of stroke remains relatively consistent but lower after this initial period. The early occurrence of stroke within the first seven days is broadly attributed to the release of debris during the procedure [52]. The particles embolized during the procedure comprise tissue fragments from the aortic valve, aortic wall, left ventricular myocardium, and thrombus as demonstrated in studies utilizing cerebral embolic protection devices during TAVR. Predominantly, the filtered debris contained thrombus, valvular tissue, or calcification resulting from structures that were touched during the TAVR procedure. The debris material filtered by the cerebral embolic protection device during ViV-TAVI is similar to the findings following native TAVR procedures [53]. The individual patient stroke risk following VIV-TAVI depends on the history of stroke, cerebrovascular risk factors, and supraventricular arrhythmia, and later occurrences of stroke are linked to these factors specific to each patient [52]. This analysis indicated that the type of valve does not increase the risk of stroke. Thus, efforts should be directed toward advancements in valve and delivery technology to minimize contact with the calcified aortic arch and native valve during TAVR.Coronary obstruction is a rare but life-threatening complication of ViV-TAVI. [45] Our results indicated no significant difference between SE and BE for the outcome. The key mechanism leading to coronary obstruction in ViV involves the surgical heart valve (SHV) bioprosthetic leaflets being displaced toward the coronary ostium due to the expansion of the transcatheter heart valve (THV). Occasionally, this can also happen if the bio-prosthesis structures extend above the sinotubular junction (STJ), maintaining proximity to the aortic wall. Consequently, upon THV deployment, the leaflets of the pre-existing SHV form a covered cylinder in the early part of the ascending aorta [54]. Hence, pre-procedural multi-slice computed tomography is essential to detect high-risk traits like low coronary heights, shallow sinuses of Valsalva, and short virtual THV to coronary ostial distance (VTC) [45]. The SAPIEN BEV constitutes a lower stent-frame height, larger cells design, and an intra-annular valve design that allow coronary artery re-intervention above the valve’s outflow tract or through the large cells of the frame. The height of stent frame of Evolut SEV extends to the coronary artery ostium due to a supra-annular valve design, making coronary re-intervention feasible only through the diamond-shaped cells following valve deployment [55].ACURATE SEV constitutes a larger cell design that facilitates the passage of catheters and guidewires at the expense of radial support strength of device thereby making it challenging in patients with heavily calcified leaflets and increasing risk of PVL. Overall, BEV may be more suitable for patients at higher risk of coronary obstruction and younger patients requiring future interventions [55].Additionally, the results demonstrated no significant difference between SE and BE for 30-d ay mortality and 1-y ear mortality. The 30-d ay mortality outcome finding is inconsistent with previous meta-analyses [56], [57]. Nonetheless, it is noteworthy to mention that our results are derived from a greater number of studies pooled in the analysis. Our results showed that SE and BE were comparable for moderate-to-severe AR. The insignificant difference can be attributed to the non-standardized measurements of AR across studies [57] Assessing AR quantitatively by MRI should be considered a surrogate endpoint for clinical outcomes in comparative studies of valves for TAVI [58].Regarding the hemodynamic differences, the findings demonstrated SEV to have lower mean transvalvular gradients at 30-d ays and at 1-y ear. The proportion of patients with PPM was also significantly lower with SEV vs. BEV. Prior literature has demonstrated superior antegrade hemodynamic performance with the SEV when compared to the BEV likely attributed to the supra-annular position of the SEV leaflets which results in lower resistance to the left ventricular outflow and gradients [55], [59], [60]. Published data has shown effective orifice area (EOA) as an indicator which defines PPM in patients following TAVR [55]. Prior literature has shown new generation SEV to have a larger EOA and lower mean pressure gradients than the new generation BEV [55]. This meta-analysis showed BEV to have decreased incidence of PVL at 1-y ear. A previous meta-analysis also demonstrated lower incidence of moderate to severe PVL with BEV (2.7 %) vs. SEV (5.6 %) [55]. According to another meta-analysis by Ando and colleagues, a reduction of moderate to severe PVL from 6.9 % to 1.6 % was noted with the SAPIEN 3 BEV [61]. The lower incidence of PVL with BEV may be attributed to its higher radial force and better adaptation to the aortic valvular annulus [55].The proper evaluation of transcatheter valve durability at long-term follow-up is one of the most important factors determining the potential expansion of TAVI towards younger and lower-risk patients. For this reason, we explored hemodynamic outcomes at varying follow-up duration owing to the progressive nature of these outcomes. Numerous studies have examined the hemodynamic status of transcatheter valves with follow-up durations extending to one year, revealing stability in valve function and the absence of structural valve failure at mid-term evaluations. Buellesfeld et al. [62] and Ussia et al. [63] observed no significant alterations in valve hemodynamic status following two- and three-y ear follow-ups, respectively, for patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) with the self-expandable CoreValve system. Additionally, the two-y ear follow-up findings from the PARTNER trial corroborated the stability of hemodynamic status after TAVI with the Edwards SAPIEN valve [64], [65]. Gurvitch et al. [66] conducted an evaluation of hemodynamic status post-TAVI utilizing a balloon-expandable Cribier-Edwards valve, reporting a slight, non-clinically significant increase in mean transvalvular gradient alongside a reduction in aortic valve area over a three-y ear period. It is crucial to acknowledge that only the PARTNER trial utilized a central echocardiography core laboratory for echocardiographic examinations, adhering to standardized protocols. Furthermore, the number of patients evaluated at each follow-up interval exhibited a significant decline over time, which hampers the feasibility of making accurate paired comparisons of echocardiographic measurements across different time points. Such factors may have introduced complexities in the interpretation of results concerning valve durability, potentially leading to misleading conclusions.Given that long-term survival is a key component in valve selection, this meta-analysis showed that there was no significant difference in 3-y ear mortality between the two valve designs. The latest advancements in transcatheter heart valve designs as well as increasing operator experience are likely to have contributed to the reduced complications and improved long-term outcomes for patients with aortic stenosis [67].5LimitationsThis meta-analysis has a few limitations that should be considered while interpreting the results. Firstly, our analysis includes data solely from observational studies prone to residual bias. Second, observational studies of this nature are likely to be subject to significant treatment bias that we cannot adjust for. Third, our outcomes may have been influenced by publication bias. Fourth, we were not able to stratify the clinical outcomes based on failing survival valve bio-prosthesis type (i.e., stented vs. stentless), failing surgical vale bio-prosthesis size and failure mode of the initial bio-prosthesis (e. g., stenosis vs. regurgitation) due to due to lack of sufficient data availability.Future studies should conduct risk stratification to determine which patient categories could benefit more from specific valve types. Further, most of the studies included in this meta-analysis comprise non-randomized observational studies highlighting the need to conduct RCTs. The only RCT included in this analysis had some limitations including small sample size of the trial and the lack of clinical adjudication committee. Also, there was not a unified method to measure the outcome of the study ''hemodynamics;'' only 50% patients had invasive hemodynamic measurements. Even though appropriate publication bias analysis for the primary outcome (30-day mortality), using a funnel plot and Egger's test was conducted, such tests could not be undertaken for secondary outcomes due to the limited number of studies. Variations in baseline LVEF might have masked the influence of valve type on outcomes.6ConclusionIn conclusion, the study found no significant differences between SE and BE valves regarding 30-day and 1-year mortality, moderate-to-severe AR at one year, or 30-day safety outcomes such as stroke, AKI, coronary obstruction, major bleeding, and major vascular complications. However, patients with SE valves had a higher risk of new permanent pacemaker insertion than BE valves. Regarding hemodynamic differences, the findings showed SEV to have lower incidence of PPM and mean transvalvular gradients while BEV was demonstrated to have lower incidence of PVL. Results from adequately powered RCTs with long-term follow-up are needed to confirm our findings.Ethical approval.This study was exempt from the institutional review board’s approval because it uses publicly available data that are de-identified.CRediT authorship contribution statementFarah Yasmin: Writing – review & editing, Writing – original draft, Visualization, Validation, Supervision, Software, Resources, Project administration, Methodology, Investigation, Formal analysis, Data curation, Conceptualization.

Nonetheless, a significant drawback of a single injection is its limited duration.[2] The utilisation of intrathecal adjuvants decreases the required amount of local anaesthetics, maintains stable haemodynamics, prolongs postoperative pain onset and reduces the need for additional analgesics after surgery. Incorporating adjuvants into the procedure also promotes swifter recovery, enabling patients to resume their regular activities at a faster pace.[3]Magnesium sulphate (MgSO4) is believed to work as an intrathecal adjuvant by antagonising N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors, which play a role in pain transmission and modulation.[45] The studies indicate that adding MgSO4 to intrathecal local anaesthetics can lead to prolonged analgesia, reduced analgesic requirements postoperatively and improved management of shivering perioperatively, all without increased significant side effects.[67]Previous meta-analyses have discussed this topic with valuable insights, but also have limitations. For instance, a meta-analysis conducted in 2013 by Pascual-Ramírez et al.[8] included smaller studies and highlighted the potential benefits of intrathecal MgSO4 as an analgesic adjuvant for spinal anaesthesia. Another meta-analysis by Wang et al.[9] in 2020 also focused on the effects of adding intrathecal MgSO4 to bupivacaine–fentanyl spinal anaesthesia. While these meta-analyses demonstrated positive outcomes, they were limited by the smaller sample sizes and the high heterogeneity detected across different outcomes.This study aims to assess the use of intrathecal MgSO4 as an adjuvant to bupivacaine in infraumbilical surgeries, focusing on examining the block characteristics and postoperative pain relief.METHODSWe have followed methodologies for this systematic review, including the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.[1011] The study protocol was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews, PROSPERO (ID: CRD42023432378, dated 14 June 2023).Data sources and search termsOur search involved five databases [PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE) and Elton B. Stephens Company (EBSCO)] covering articles published until 19 April 2023. The search terms included variations related to intrathecal administration (intrathecal, subarachnoid, intraspinal, spinal block, IT), MgSO4 (Magnesium Sulfate, mg sulfate, MgSO4, magnesium) and the types of surgeries (orthopaedic surgery, orthopaedic, infra umbilical, obstetrics, gynaecology, urological, abdominal surgery, appendectomy, bowel resection, rectal surgery, hysterectomy, oophorectomy, prostate surgery, hernia repair, cesarean section, hip).

We included studies with English full text. We excluded abstracts, studies with no English full text, single-arm studies, other routes of administration (intravenous, intramuscular or epidural) or different combinations such as MgSO4+ (morphine or dexamethasone).Study selectionAny duplicate records were removed using EndNote.[12] Subsequently, four separate reviewers (MNB, OA, DA, FA) screened the titles and abstracts using Rayyan, with their decisions being double-checked for accuracy.[13] Then, we screened the full-text articles for eligibility. We resolved disagreements through discussion or consulting a senior reviewer (MMB).Data extraction and outcomesWe extracted data using carefully designed Excel sheets; we created three Excel sheets: (1) baseline sheet, which contained sample size, age, sex, weight, height, and body mass index (BMI); (2) summary sheet contained country, study design, surgery type, surgery duration, inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria, outcomes measured and conclusion and (3) outcomes sheet: the primary outcome was determining the duration of motor and sensory blockade. The secondary outcome was to explore differences in the onset time of the sensory and motor block, postoperative pain [visual analogue scale (VAS)] and general symptoms (shivering, hypotension, nausea and vomiting). Five reviewers participated in this stage, ensuring that all decisions were double-checked.Study endpointsThe endpoints of this review were (1) onset of sensory block, defined as the time interval between intrathecal administration of the drug and T12 or higher dermatome sensory effect; (2) duration of sensory block, defined as time to regress to S1 from the maximum sensory block level; (3) two-segment regression: ‘two segments’ defined as two dermatome segments from the maximum sensory block level or to achieve T10 level; (4) duration of analgesia (pain-free period), defined as the period from the time of intrathecal injection to the time of first complaint of pain or first rescue analgesia; (5) onset of motor block, defined as the time between intrathecal injection and a modified Bromage score of 1 or higher; (6) duration of motor block, defined as the time of regression to a modified Bromage score of 0 and (7) incidence of side effects such as hypotension, nausea, vomiting and shivering.Risk of bias and quality assessmentWe used the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 (ROB 2) tool to assess the quality of the included randomised controlled trials (RCTs).[14] This assessment was conducted by two reviewers (DA and FA). This tool evaluates five key domains: bias arising from the randomisation process, deviations from intended interventions, measurement of the outcome, missing outcome data and selection of reported results. Each domain is assessed using questions and overall evaluation of ‘low risk’, ‘some concerns’ or ‘high risk’ of bias. This systematic approach helps to make informed judgements.Statistical analysisWe extracted our outcomes from text, tables and images of each included study. We analysed data using Review Manager (RevMan version 5.4 for Windows, developed by The Cochrane Collaboration in 2020). We represented continuous outcomes such as time to regression, onset of sensory and motor block and duration of motor block as mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The median was used to estimate the mean if the value was not reported. Whenever the standard error of the mean (SEM) was reported, the standard deviation (SD) was obtained using the formula SD = SEM × √N. We extracted dichotomous outcomes (shivering, hypotension, nausea and vomiting) directly when the number of patients was mentioned or indirectly by calculating back when reported as a percentage of patients. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CI. Individual definitions for the study outcomes (sensory, motor, analgesia or side effects) were also accepted as described in each study. The incidence of any event was used for analysis if reported at least once in the patient. A random-effects model was chosen due to the high heterogeneity observed across the studies, as indicated by I2 statistics. We considered I2 values above 50% to reflect moderate to substantial heterogeneity, and values over 75% showed considerable heterogeneity.A sensitivity analysis was performed to address the observed heterogeneity, which included a Leave-One-Out Test to evaluate the influence of individual studies on the overall results. Given the variability in MgSO4 dosages across studies (50, 75 and 100 mg), a subgroup analysis was conducted based on the dose to examine their respective effects on outcomes. All results were considered statistically significant if the P value was less than 0.05. Studies with unreported or inconclusive data that could not be obtained after attempts to contact authors were excluded from this meta-analysis.RESULTSStudy selectionThe PRISMA flow diagram of the study selection process is given in Figure 1. A total of 4194 records were identified from five databases and registers. Finally, 32 studies were included in the analyses [Table 1].Figure 1PRISMA flow chart of studies. PRISMA = Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-AnalysesStudy characteristicsStudy designAll studies were RCTs, ensuring a high level of evidence by minimising bias [Table 1].InterventionAll studies compared MgSO4 combined with bupivacaine to bupivacaine alone or normal saline. The dosage of MgSO4 varied across studies, ranging from 25 to 100 mg. Bupivacaine’s operational form was 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine. Its dosage ranged between 10, 12.5 and 15 mg. The injection volume ranged between 0.5 and 3 ml. We extracted only the previously described intervention and control arms from studies that examined any other adjuvant such as sufentanil or neostigmine [Table 1].SettingMost studies (15 out of 32) were conducted in India. Studies were also conducted in several other countries, including Iran (seven studies), Egypt (five studies), China (one study), Nigeria (one study), Turkey (one study), Iraq (one study) and Italy (one study) [Table 1].Type of surgeryMost studies focused on caesarean sections. Another prevalent category investigated lower limb surgeries, including orthopaedic procedures. Fewer studies explored the role of MgSO4 in gynaecological laparoscopy and uroscopic surgery [Table 1].Patients’ baseline characteristicsThis review analysed data from 2379 participants across several studies. Participants ranged in age from 25 to 52 years (mean of 37.26 years). Females comprised 50.56% of the cohort (1203 participants) and 39.25% of those undergoing non-obstetric or gynaecological surgeries (416 participants). Among studies reporting weight (n = 22), the average weight was 67.65 kg, while the average height for studies reporting this data (n = 18) was 155.39 cm. Notably, only eight studies reported BMI, for which the average was 28.41 kg/m2 [Table 2].Table 2Baseline characteristics of the enrolled patients in the included studiesStudy IDInterventionSample sizeAge (years), mean (SD)Female, n (%)Weight (kg), mean (SD)Height (cm), mean (SD)BMI (kg/m2), mean (SD)Chaudhary, 2016[26]50 mg3040.57 (13.53)12 (40%)N/AN/A23.14 (1.54)100 mg3037.23 (11.41)11 (36.6%)N/AN/A23.56 (2.22)Control3038.2 (9.63)15 (50%)N/AN/A23.29 (2.51)Hamawy, 2015[27]10 mg3028 (2.7)30 (100%)N/AN/A31.3 (1.8)Control3027 (3.9)30 (100%)N/AN/A31.4 (1.7)Jabalameli, 2012[28]50 mg3328 (3.6)33 (100%)72 (9)N/AN/A75 mg3326 (4.8)33 (100%)75 (8)N/AN/A100 mg3327 (4.8)33 (100%)78 (7)N/AN/AControl3326.7 (3)33 (100%)74 (3)N/AN/ATuteja, 2022[29]50 mg3530.66 (4.23)35 (100%)66.91 (5.29)N/AN/A75 mg3530.14 (4.53)35 (100%)68.83 (7.96)N/AN/AControl3530.02 (4.01)35 (100%)67.51 (9.28)N/AN/AMadhukant, 2022[30]50 mg4037.4 (10.1)20 (50%)65 (4)159 (5)N/AControl4038.2 (2.5)18 (45%)64 (7)157 (6)N/ARaghuvanshi, 2022[16]50 mg3743.5 (11.7)31 (84%)56.2 (6.2)161.2 (2.6)N/AControl3743.5 (9.2)18 (49%)53.8 (5)161.4 (1.9)N/AAlkhazraji, 202[31]75 mg6426.16 (4.43)64 (100%)68.97 (5.98)N/AN/AControl6426.47 (5.65)64 (100%)69.69 (3.99)N/AN/AMostafa, 2019[32]50 mg3029.6 (3.4)30 (100%)74.1 (8.5)166.7 (8.6)N/AControl3029.2 (5.6)30 (100%)75.2 (8.6)165 (2.6)N/AOmar, 2019[33]25 mg3549.03 (8.83)9 (25.7%)82.29 (9.34)174.29 (5.02)N/AControl3550.29 (8.87)7 (20%)83.43 (7.93)173.71 (5.60)N/ADeepa, 2017[34]50 mg3045.03 (6.8)30 (100%)57.4 (3.03)155.8 (3.5)N/AControl3046.93 (5.3)30 (100%)57.43 (3.09)156 (3)N/AFarooq, 2017[15]50 mg30N/AN/AN/AN/AN/AControl30N/AN/AN/AN/AN/AXiao, 2017[35]50 mg3026 (3)30 (100%)72 (4)162 (3)N/AControl3025 (3)30 (100%)72 (4)162 (3)N/AZakeri, 2017[17]100 mg3128.043 (5.285)31 (100%)N/AN/AN/AControl3128.043 (5.285)31 (100%)N/AN/AN/AKhandelwal, 2017[36]50 mg3043.73 (8.86)27 (90%)58.97 (10.92)162.77 (8.6)22.5 (5.1)Control3039.9 (8.83)27 (90%)59.6 (13.72)164.77 (9.86)22.3 (6.3)Mohamed, 2017[37]50 mg3027.4 (4.38)30 (100%)69.27 (9.03)161.27 (7.37)N/AControl3027.77 (4.199)30 (100%)71.43 (9.489)160.17 (7.34)N/AYadav, 2015[18]25 mg19N/A4 (21.05%)N/AN/AN/A50 mg18N/A1 (5.55%)N/AN/AN/A100 mg16N/A6 (37.5%)N/AN/AN/AControl21N/A3 (14.2%)N/AN/AN/AKatiyar, 2015[38]50 mg30N/AN/AN/AN/AN/A100 mg30N/AN/AN/AN/AN/AControl30N/AN/AN/AN/AN/ABanihashem, 2015[39]50 mg4026.88 (4.44)40 (100%)83.10 (11.91)N/AN/AControl4027.48 (4.49)40 (100%)78.131 (0.89)N/AN/AKalthuria, 2014[40]50 mg3036.49 (30%)64.3166N/A75 mg3043.13 (10%)64.77166.75N/AControl3043.222 (73.33%)63.67165.67N/AJAISWAL, 2013[41]50 mg5037.08 (13.70)10 (20%)62.32 (10.05)165.66 (6.95)N/A100 mg5035.50 (12.29)5 (10%)64.08 (12.94)167.46 (6.29)N/AControl5037.10 (12.09)12 (24%)63.40 (12.36)166.58 (7.02)N/AFaiz, 2013[42]25 mg3626.22 (3.78)36 (100%)N/AN/A27.92 (0.88)Control3627.20 (3.94)36 (100%)N/AN/A27.64 (0.93)Khezri, 2012[43]50 mg3042.70 (12.93)25 (83.3%)64.70 (11.83)178.

Eight studies were considered high risk, four exhibited some concerns regarding bias and 20 were determined to have a low risk of bias.However, it is important to focus on high-risk studies, which often suffer from methodological limitations, such as selection bias, performance bias, detection bias and reporting bias. Farooq and Gupta[15] was one of the studies that demonstrated an overall high risk of bias, as the authors were not clear about their allocation concealment methods, reporting all missing data and using scales that did not prove its validity, the method of statistical analysis was not reported and the results might have been affected by the observer’s knowledge of the allocation. Raghuvanshi et al.,[16] Zakeri et al.[17] and Yadav et al.[18] showed similar remarks to Farooq and Guptas’s[15] study.Attia et al.[19] also showed an overall high risk of bias and raised concerns about the validity of their results. Namely, there was an inadequate mention of missing data and, most importantly of all, the absence of descriptions of many methods that did not gather enough data to assess their validity.Overall, the two main reasons to consider all studies on any domain a high risk or raising some concerns were the lack of experimental process description and subjective reporting [Supplementary Figure 1].OutcomesSensory block: The addition of MgSO4 to bupivacaine consistently delayed the onset of sensory block, as evidenced by its prolongation of the time to reach both T10 (MD: 1.93 min; 95% CI: 1.10, 2.77; P < 0.0001) and T6 (MD: 1.51 min; 95% CI: 1.33, 1.69; P < 0.00001). These findings indicate that MgSO4 uniformly slows the onset of sensory block across different dermatomal levels. However, MgSO4 significantly prolonged the time for regression of two segments from the maximum block height (MD: 27.18 min; 95% CI: 12.56, 41.79; P = 0.0003) and the time for regression to S1 level (MD: 43.73 min; 95% CI: 19.23, 68.24; P = 0.0005). Substantial heterogeneity was observed in all the studies for all sensory block outcomes, except for the onset time of the T6 sensory block [Figures 2 and 3].Figure 2Forest plot of time for regression: (a) time for regression of two segments from the maximum block height, (b) time for regression to S1 level.

For the onset of motor block to a Bromage score of 2, there was no significant difference between both groups (MD: 0.9 min; 95% CI: -0.8, 2.6; P = 0.3). In contrast, the onset of motor block to a Bromage score of 1 was significantly delayed in the MgSO4 group compared to the control group (MD: 3.24 min; 95% CI: 1.23, 5.26; P = 0.002). Overall, MgSO4 significantly prolonged the motor block duration (MD: 15.13 min; 95% CI: 4.59, 25.66; P = 0.005), with the most pronounced effect observed with a 75 mg dose (MD: 43.37 min; 95% CI: 35.44, 51.30; P = 0.006). However, substantial heterogeneity was observed among the studies for all motor block outcomes [Figures 4 and 5].Figure 4Forest plot of duration of motor block (Bromage score of 0).

Notably, MgSO4 significantly extended the time to first analgesia (MD: 43.80 min; 95% CI: 26.47, 61.14; P < 0.00001), with substantial heterogeneity observed among the studies (I2 =99%) [Figure 6a].Figure 6(a) Forest plot of time for first rescue analgesia, (b) forest plot of postoperative VAS scores. Chi2=Chi-squared statistic, CI=confidence interval, df=degrees of freedom, IV=inverse variance, SD=standard deviation, Tau2=between-study variance, VAS=visual analogue scale, Z=Z-test for overall effectPostoperative pain: At all measured time points (1, 6 and 12 h), administration of 50 mg of MgSO4 resulted in significant improvements in VAS scores compared to controls (MD: -1.53, 95% CI: -2.44, -0.62, P = 0.001; MD: -0.59, 95% CI: -0.88, -0.31, P < 0.0001 and MD: -0.35, 95% CI: -0.61, -0.09, P = 0.009, respectively). However, high heterogeneity was observed across all analyses, with I2 values of 99%, 92% and 86%, respectively [Figure 6b].Safety outcomes: Adding MgSO4 to bupivacaine did not significantly affect the incidence of shivering, hypotension, nausea or vomiting. For shivering, the overall risk ratio (RR) was 0.68 (95% CI: 0.36, 1.27) with a P value of 0.23 [Supplementary Figure 2]. For hypotension, the overall RR was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.47, 1.25) with a P value of 0.29 [Supplementary Figure 3]. For nausea, the overall RR was 0.70 (95% CI: 0.47, 1.02) with a P value of 0.07 [Supplementary Figure 4]. For vomiting, the overall RR was 1.07 (95% CI: 0.61, 1.89) with a P value of 0.81 [Supplementary Figure 5].Sensitivity analysis: To adjust the heterogeneity of the subgroups, a sensitivity analysis was conducted. However, the analysis yielded insignificant results. This suggests that the removal or inclusion of specific studies did not significantly alter the overall conclusions of our systematic review.DISCUSSIONOur systematic review and meta-analysis revealed the potential of intrathecal MgSO4 in prolonging sensory and motor block duration. However, we observed a faster onset of sensory and motor block in the control group compared to the (MgSO4 and bupivacaine) group. In addition, we noted a significant delay in rescue analgesia and lower postoperative VAS scores with (MgSO4 and bupivacaine).One of the primary objectives for physicians is to alleviate distress. Successful pain management during the peri- and postoperative periods is crucial, as it helps mitigate autonomic, somatic and endocrine responses, potentially reducing perioperative complications.[20] This systematic review, including 2379 patients from 32 trials across infraumbilical surgeries, is the first to assess the impact of intrathecal MgSO4 on perioperative analgesia and to conduct a meta-analysis of RCTs, specifically in infraumbilical surgeries.Overall, our study provides comprehensive insights into the effects of intrathecal MgSO4 on sensory block characteristics. With respect to the duration of sensory block regression by two dermatomal levels from peak block height, our meta-analysis indicates a consistently and significantly prolonged sensory block in the MgSO4 and bupivacaine group compared to bupivacaine alone. Particularly, the overall effect size favoured the (MgSO4 + bupivacaine) group, with an MD of 27.18 min (95% CI: 12.56, 41.79), indicating the potential clinical significance of this additional therapy. These findings were consistent with Zeng et al.’s[21] systematic review.Subgroup analyses showed that both 50 and 100 mg doses of MgSO4 significantly prolonged sensory block regression times. However, substantial heterogeneity among the included trials, likely due to differences in study design, patient populations, type of procedure or dosage regimens, highlights the need for improvement in treatment protocols.Our findings reveal that the control group had a faster onset of sensory block to the T10 dermatome compared to the MgSO4 and bupivacaine group, consistent with Pascual-Ramírez et al.[8] Subgroup analyses based on MgSO4 dosage revealed consistent trends, with both 50 and 100 mg doses showing delays in the onset of sensory block compared to bupivacaine alone.The meta-analysis demonstrated that MgSO4 significantly prolonged motor block duration compared to the control group, with a pooled effect size of 15.13 min (95% CI: 4.59, 25.66), suggesting a delay in motor recovery compared to control. This contradicts the findings of Pascual-Ramírez et al.,[8] which indicated no difference in time to full motor recovery. Subgroup analyses indicated varying degrees of prolongation depending on the MgSO4 dosage, notably 75 and 100 mg.In rescue analgesia, we found that more time was taken for the first rescue analgesia in (MgSO4 + bupivacaine) than in control groups. The overall MD indicated a prolongation of 43 min, suggesting that MgSO4 extends the duration before patients require additional analgesia. Our findings are consistent with those of Shi et al.,[22] Pascual-Ramírez et al.,[8] Xiang et al.[23] and Peng et al.[24] regarding the first time of analgesic requirement, while Azimi et al.[25] found no significant difference in the time to first rescue analgesia when MgSO4 was added.Our subgroup analysis, which focused on the MgSO4 50 mg dosage, revealed a pooled MD of 45.66 min, significantly reflecting a delay in the requirement for rescue analgesia. In contrast, MgSO4 100 mg did not consistently delay the onset of rescue analgesia. These results may be attributed to the smaller sample size in the 75 mg subgroup and fewer RCTs.Our analysis of postoperative pain, assessed through VAS scores, demonstrated significantly lower overall scores among the 420 participants in the (MgSO4 + bupivacaine) group at a dosage of 50 mg postoperatively, with a pooled MD indicating a difference of -0.79 (95% CI: -1.16, -0.41). Furthermore, subgroup analyses focusing on VAS scores at different time points revealed consistent improvements in pain management with MgSO4 50 mg. These findings underscore the efficacy of MgSO4 as an adjunct to bupivacaine in relieving postoperative pain, consistent with the findings of Azimi et al.’s review[25] and previous studies.[821222325]Regarding safety concerns, although MgSO4 50 mg demonstrated trends towards reducing the incidence of shivering, hypotension, nausea and vomiting, these findings lacked statistical significance, indicating the need for larger studies to confirm these trends. While our results are consistent with those of Zeng et al.[21] and Peng et al.[24] regarding the efficacy of MgSO4 in reducing nausea, vomiting and shivering, other studies have reported no difference in postoperative adverse effects with the addition of MgSO4.[8222325]Our study’s strengths lie in its comprehensive and robust methodology. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of various studies across different surgeries and patient groups. This allowed us to explore the use of intrathecal MgSO4 in anaesthesia, focusing on pain relief, sensory and motor block duration and safety concerns. Our findings, consistent with previous research, provide assurance of the effectiveness of MgSO4. Overall, our study contributes significantly to improving perioperative care practices.Although we conducted a sensitivity analysis and subgroup analysis to mitigate heterogeneity, limitations persist in our study. Wide variability in patient populations, dosage regimens, type of surgery and outcome measures across included trials contribute to heterogeneity, potentially impacting the consistency and generalisability of our findings. Furthermore, differences in MgSO4 doses and treatment protocols complicate the interpretation of results, making the determination of the optimal dosage or administration regimen difficult. In addition, variability in patient characteristics, such as age, comorbidities and surgical procedures, could affect treatment response and introduce confounding factors that are challenging to be addressed in the analysis. While sensitivity analysis did not significantly alter the overall conclusions, these limitations highlight the need for cautious interpretation of our findings.CONCLUSIONWhile our review highlights the potential benefits of intrathecal MgSO4 in anaesthesia – particularly in prolonging sensory and motor block duration and improving pain management – the substantial heterogeneity across studies, with some analyses showing variability as high as 99%, limits the strength of these findings. The variations in dosages and treatment protocols emphasise the need for personalised dosing to achieve optimal outcomes while minimising risks. Clear guidelines for MgSO4 use are essential to ensure its safe and effective integration into clinical practice.Data availabilityData for this systematic review and/or meta-analysis may be requested with reasonable justification from the authors (email to the corresponding author) and shall be shared upon request.Conflicts of interestThere are no conflicts of interest.Supplementary Figure 1Risk of bias assessmentSupplementary Figure 2Forest plot of shivering incidence.

{"PMCID": "12186734", "title": "Efficacy and Safety of Olezarsen in Dyslipidemia: A Systematic Review and Dose-response Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials", "abstract": "Olezarsen emerged as a novel promising Apo-C3 inhibitor for dyslipidemia. However, its dose-response relationship remains uncertain. This review aims to evaluate the lipid-lowering effect of olezarsen, safety measures, and dose-response effects to determine the optimal dose. A systematic search was conducted across Scopus, PubMed, Science-Direct, and CENTRAL on January 2, 2025. Randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing olezarsen with placebo in dyslipidemia was included. The Rob 2.0 tool was implemented to assess quality. R-studio and STATA were used to conduct statistical analysis. From a total of 194 documents at initial search, four RCTs involving 361 patients were included in the present analysis. Olezarsen significantly reduces plasma Apo-C3 across all dosage cohorts, including a 50 mg dose (MD: −70.31 %; 95 % CI: −83.89 to −56.74; p < 0.01) and an 80 mg dose administered every four weeks. It also significantly lowered triglycerides at any dose level, with reductions observed at 50 mg (MD: −49.84 %; 95 % CI = −70.42 to −22.37; p = 0) and 80 mg (MD: −52.32 %; 95 % CI: −58.25 to −46.40; p < 0.01). Olezarsen has minimal effect on low-density lipoprotein (LDL) but significantly increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Dose-response meta-analysis modeling suggests that 50 mg administered every four weeks may represent the optimal dose, beyond which added benefits diminish. Safety analysis revealed tolerability in liver, renal, and hematological parameters. In conclusion, olezarsen is an effective Apo-C3 inhibitor that improves lipid profiles with a favorable safety profile. This modeling-based insight refines previous findings by delineating a clearer therapeutic window.", "body": "1.IntroductionDyslipidemia is a significant global health issue associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), leading to major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) [1,2]. Annually, the burden of dyslipidemia-related cardiovascular events has reached an estimated 4.3 million deaths, with its prevalence still increasing in the modern world [3]. Sedentary lifestyles, obesity, and unhealthy diets largely drive the growing prevalence of dyslipidemia. Moreover, genetic predisposition has also been known as a key factor in dyslipidemia. In high cardiovascular risk or inherited lipid disorders such as familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS) or familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), lifestyle changes may impose constraints with a limited set of effective drugs [2,4]. Hence, this issue promotes the development of effective and safe novel lipid-lowering strategies [5].The pathophysiology behind dyslipidemia is complex and influenced by many factors. One of the novel key factors is apolipoprotein C-III (Apo-C3). In recent years, Apo-C3 has been known as a protein that mainly inhibits the lipoprotein lipase (LPL). This inhibition reduces the clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (TRL), for which LPL is the main enzyme responsible for breaking down the TRL [6]. This impact can raise plasma triglyceride levels, potentially increasing the risk of developing ASCVD. In addition, Apo-C3 has also shown direct influence on atherosclerosis by increasing the affinity of lipoproteins for artery wall proteoglycans, which can lead to retention of lipoproteins and promote inflammation [7,8]. APO-C3’s principal mechanism makes it a novel key target for therapeutic strategies in dyslipidemia, particularly those with hypertriglyceridemia.Considering its promising mechanism of action, increasing interest has driven the development of several Apo-C3 inhibitors, including volanesorsen (the first approved agent), olezarsen, and plozasiran [9–12]. Among these, all have demonstrated significant efficacy in lowering lipid parameters, particularly triglycerides, with volanesorsen yielding the most excellent triglyceride-lowering effect [9–13]. However, substantial evidence demonstrated its high rate of thrombocytopenia in clinical practice, raising concerns about its safety and tolerability [9,14,15].In response, newer agents such as olezarsen may address these safety concerns while maintaining therapeutic efficacy [16]. A previous systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to systematically evaluate the efficacy and safety of olezarsen in managing hypertriglyceridemia in patients at high risk for cardiovascular events [17]. While the analysis yielded significant insights regarding the overall effectiveness and safety profile of olezarsen, it did not determine the optimal dosage, leaving a critical gap in understanding its precise therapeutic potential. Establishing the optimal dosage is essential for maximizing therapeutic advantages, particularly given that the 2024 report indicated that olezarsen can decrease triglyceride levels by half, but the optimal dose remains unclear [20].A prior network meta-analysis (NWMA) by Mahmoud et al. compared several Apo-C3 inhibitors, including olezarsen, across multiple dosing strategies. Their analysis demonstrated comparable efficacy between 50 mg and 80 mg doses of olezarsen, with overlapping confidence intervals in both lipid-lowering effects [13]. However, while their study provided broader inter-agent comparisons, it did not delve into dose-specific relationship modeling or determine an inflection point for optimal efficacy and tolerability. To address the issue, our study focuses on a dose-response meta-analysis (DRMA) specifically for olezarsen, aiming to evaluate its optimal dose that balances clinical benefit and tolerability. By synthesizing dose-response effects from randomized controlled trials (RCTs), this analysis aims to strengthen the clinical understanding of olezarsen’s therapeutic potential and supports evidence-based decision-making in lipid management.2.MethodsThis systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for reporting [18]. The study has been registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) under the registration number CRD42024581760.2.1. Study eligibilityWe included studies based on the following inclusion criteria: (1) RCT that directly compared the usage of olezarsen and placebo; (2) enrolled patients with dyslipidemia, either familial or acquired, as evidenced by increased levels of at least one of the lipid parameters, including plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (>100 mg/dL) and/or plasma triglycerides (>150 mg/dL). In contrast, exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) review articles, case reports, case series, letters, commentaries, conference abstracts, and observational studies; (2) articles published in a non-English language; (3) irretrievable full text. In this study, there were no restrictions at the time of publication.2.2. Search strategies and data extractionA systematic search was conducted on PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and CENTRAL on January 2, 2025. The search strategy for PubMed and Scopus was: ((“Olezarsen” OR “AKCEA-APOCIIILRx”) AND (“dyslipid*” OR “hyperlipid*” OR “Familial Chylomicronemia Syndrome” OR “Familial Hypercholesterolemia” OR “Hyperlipoproteinemia” OR “hypertriglycerid*”)). The search strategy for ScienceDirect and CENTRAL was: ((“Olezarsen” OR “AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx”) AND (“dyslipidemia” OR “hyperlipidemia” OR “Familial Chylomicronemia Syndrome” OR “Familial Hypercholesterolemia” OR “Hyperlipoproteinemia” OR “ hypertriglyceridemia”)).The articles were then screened by title and abstract with two independent reviewers (CDT and EMK). Any disagreement or conflict will be solved through arbitration with the third reviewer (RM). From the articles included in this study, two authors (CDT and MAW) extracted the following data: (1) first author and publication years, (2) type of study, (3) number of patients, (4) mean age, (5) baseline lipids profile of each dosing group, and (6) outcomes. The outcomes for this study were a percentage decrease from baseline of Apo-C3, triglycerides, LDL, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and a safety analysis of any adverse event (AE) that occurred.2.3. Quality assessmentWe used version 2.0 of the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials (RoB 2) to evaluate eligible studies. The Rob 2 tool comprises five domains, which were determined to cover all significant mechanisms that lead to bias incorporated into trial outcomes [19]. Two reviewers (EMK and MFH) independently evaluated the risk of bias in eligible studies. Any disagreement or conflict was solved with the third reviewer (MAR).2.4. Statistical analysisFor each outcome that met the criteria, a meta-analysis was conducted using the ‘meta’ package from R Studio version 4.4.1 (Posit PBC, Boston, USA). An online converter was used to convert median into mean data (https://www.math.hkbu.edu.hk/~tongt/papers/median2mean.html). The heterogeneity will be evaluated using I2 Higgins with 25 %, 26–50 %, and 50 % indicating low, moderate, and high heterogeneity, respectively. A fixed-effect measure was employed in advance, considering minimal variability between studies and the small study sample observed. The pooled effect sizes were measured using the mean difference (MD) of percentage points (%) with an estimator model of restricted maximum likelihood (REML). A subsequent sensitivity analysis was conducted with the leave-one-out technique to evaluate robustness and potential study affecting heterogeneity.Subsequently, a dose-response meta-analysis was performed using STATA version 17 (StataCorp LLC, Texas, United States). We examined only the single dose of olezarsen injection, standardizing each dose of olezarsen administered once every four weeks, without considering simultaneous calculations for up-titration or down-titration. If dosing was not administered every four-week interval, we converted the total dose given at various intervals into an equivalent dose for a four-week interval. The initial dose-response relationship was examined using a linear mixed-effects regression model. Subsequently, a non-linear mixed-effects regression model was developed to provide a comparison to the linear model. The model with the highest log-likelihood ratio was selected, and the significance of the dose-response relationship was evaluated based on the p-value of the dose coefficient.3.Results3.1. Main information of study selection, characteristics, and quality assessmentThe initial search yielded a total of 194 related articles from the peer-reviewed database. After 22 articles were removed due to duplication, 167 articles underwent title and abstract screening. Among these, five articles were selected for full-text screening. One article was eliminated since the study did not provide the required outcomes. This systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis included 361 patients from four RCTs [11,20–22], with the detailed screening and review of articles available in Fig. 1.Across the four studies, patients exhibited varying characteristics of dyslipidemia [11,20–22]. All studies included patients diagnosed with hypertriglyceridemia, ranging from mild to severe. Notably, Stroes et al. focused on a specific population with FCS [22]. Of the four studies, three employed fixed-dose regimens [11,20,22], whereas Alexander et al. investigated both single-ascending and multiple-ascending dose cohorts [21]. Table 1 presents detailed study characteristics and key findings, while Table 2 summarizes the lipid profiles and dosing strategies in each included study.From quality assessment across five key domains, none of the studies exhibited concerns or high risk in any of these domains, indicating a consistently low risk of bias. This suggests a high level of methodological rigor across the included trials. A detailed summary of the quality assessment for each study is presented in Fig. 2.3.2. Apolipoprotein C-IIIAll studies reported the quantitative Apo-C3 change from baseline. Tardiff et al. demonstrated significant differences in all dosing methods in the olezarsen and placebo groups in a 6-month follow-up. The most significant percentage decrease was achieved with 50 mg olezarsen (−74 % vs 2 %, p < 0.0001) [11]. Alexander et al. reported a significant difference in all dosing cohorts, with the most significant decrease being achieved with 60 mg every four weeks (−86.1% vs 3.3 %, p < 0.001) at 92 days follow-up [21]. Stroes et al. also reported similar outcomes in 50 mg and 80 mg dosing at 6-month follow-up, with the highest difference achieved with 80 mg every four weeks dosing (−66.1 % vs 7.57 %) [22]. Bergmark et al. did not report specific percentage change for each group, but the difference compared to placebo for each dose (50 mg and 80 mg) is significant [20]. At 6-month follow-up, the meta-analysis showed that 50 mg olezarsen significantly reduces Apo-C3 levels (MD: −70.31 %; 95 % CI = −83.89 to −56.74; p < 0.01; Fig. 3A). The data on the effect of olezarsen across different doses are available in Supplementary Table 1 (https://www.j-saudi-heart.com/cgi/editor.cgi?article=1439&window=additional_files&context=jsha).A mixed-effects regression was conducted using data from three studies to evaluate the effect of each dose on Apo-C3 percentage change. A linear regression model was initially applied, yielding a significant dose coefficient. However, when a cubic spline model was used to explore the non-linear relationship, the log-likelihood ratio was superior to that of the linear model, indicating a better fit. The knots were placed at doses of 40 mg, 50 mg, and 80 mg. The model’s intercept was strongly negative, establishing a low baseline for MD when the dose was zero (−13.15; 95 % CI: −22.94 to −3.35, p = 0.008). In the spline model, the first spline term (spline dose 1) showed a significantly negative coefficient for doses below 50 mg (−1.171; 95 % CI: −1.231 to −1.111, p < 0.001), indicating that as the dose increased up to approximately 50 mg, the MD consistently decreased. For doses above 50 mg, the relationship between dose and MD shifted, with the second spline term (spline dose 2) showing a positive coefficient (1.571; 95 % CI: 1.441 to 1.700, p < 0.001). Despite the positive effect of spline dose 2 on MD, the strong negative intercept and significant negative effect at lower doses resulted in all predicted MD values being negative across the observed dose range. This finding suggests that the Apo-C3 rate may be less affected by an increase in the olezarsen dose beyond 50 mg. The graph illustrating the predicted value is depicted in Fig. 3B, with the complete predictive value of the dose-response effect available in Supplementary Table 2 (https://www.j-saudiheart.com/cgi/editor.cgi?article=1439&window=additional_files&context=jsha).3.3. TriglyceridesOf the four studies included, all reported the quantitative triglyceride change. Tardif et al. reported a significant difference in percentage decrease from baseline of triglyceride levels across all dosing groups at 6-month follow-up, with the highest decrease from baseline when compared to placebo achieved with 50 mg olezarsen (−60 % vs 6 %, p < 0.0001) [11]. Alexander et al. reported significantly different percentage decreases in 15 mg weekly (equal to 60 mg every four weeks, respectively) and 60 mg every four weeks dosing. The highest difference percentage decrease was achieved in 30 mg weekly or equal to 120 mg every four weeks (−70.8 % vs 20 %, p < 0.0001) at 43 days of follow-up [21]. Bergmark et al. demonstrated a significant difference in percentage decrease of triglyceride levels with 50 mg (−57.1 % vs. 7.8 %, p < 0.001) and 80 mg (−60.9 % vs. −7.8 %, p < 0.001) olezarsen at 6-month follow-up [20]. Stroes et al. also reported a significant decrease in the 80 mg group compared to placebo (−35.1 % vs 11.6 %, p < 0.001). However, the difference in 50 mg was insignificant (−12.1 % vs 11.6 %, p = 0.06) at 6-month follow-up [22].A meta-analysis was performed on the 50 mg and 80 mg dosages. In three studies that compared the 50 mg olezarsen to the placebo, the triglyceride level was substantially reduced at the 6-month follow-up (MD: −49.84 %; 95 % CI= −70.42 to −22.37; p < 0.01; Fig. 4A) with significant heterogeneity. A subsequent sensitivity analysis (Fig. 4B) confirms robustness with unchanged significance value when omitting any study. However, the heterogeneity was not affected by a single study, suggesting the intra-study variability. A substantial reduction in triglyceride levels was also achieved at the 6-month follow-up in two studies that utilized the 80 mg dose (MD: −52.32 %; 95 % CI = −58.25 to −46.40; p < 0.01; Fig. 4C). The detailed data of the effect across different doses is available in Supplementary Table 3 (https://www.j-saudi-heart.com/cgi/editor.cgi?article=1439&window=additional_files&context=jsha).A mixed-effects regression analysis was conducted to assess the effect of olezarsen at different doses. Initially, a linear model showed significant results. However, further evaluation was carried out using a spline model with cubic knots positioned at 40, 50, and 80 mg doses. The spline model demonstrated a superior log-likelihood to the linear model, indicating a better fit to the data. The model’s intercept was negative, though insignificant (−1.59; 95 % CI: −21.27 to 18.08, p = 0.874). In the spline model, the first spline term (spline dose 1) showed a significantly negative coefficient for doses below 50 mg (−0.98; 95 % CI: −1.05 to −0.91, p < 0.001), indicating that as the dose increased up to approximately 50 mg, the MD consistently decreased. For doses above 50 mg, the relationship between dose and MD shifted, with the second spline term (spline dose 2) having a positive coefficient (1.22; 95 % CI: 1.06 to 1.38, p < 0.001). Although spline dose 2 positively affected MD, the significant negative effect at lower doses likely shifted all predicted MD values into the negative range across the observed dose levels. These findings suggest that increasing the olezarsen dose beyond 50 mg may have a diminished effect on triglyceride levels. The predicted value is depicted in Fig. 5, with the complete predictive value of the dose-response effect available in the Supplementary Table 4 (https://www.j-saudi-heart.com/cgi/editor.cgi?article=1439&window=additional_files&context=jsha).3.4. Low-density lipoproteinThree of the four included studies reported the LDL change. Tardif et al. reported no substantial change of LDL from baseline at 6-month follow-up. The LDL level was 1 % lower in the 15 mg every two weeks group compared to placebo (p = 0.94). In the other dosing groups, all showed comparable results. This effect is presumably associated with the adjustment or discontinuation of background LDL-lowering drugs in those patients [11]. Stroes et al. also reported an increase in LDL levels on 50 mg and 80 mg dosages every four weeks [22]. However, Bergmark et al. demonstrated that the LDL percentage decreased on 50 mg and 80 mg dosages every four weeks, although the result was not significant (p = 0.24, p = 0.36, respectively) [20]. From these findings, olezarsen appears to have minimal or no effect on LDL levels.3.5. High-density lipoproteinOf the four studies included, only three reported an HDL increase in each group. Tardif et al. showed a significant difference compared to placebo in change of HDL from baseline on all olezarsen dosing groups at 6-month follow-up. However, the HDL increase was superior in the 10 mg every week or 40 mg every four weeks group compared to the 50 mg group (p < 0.0001) [11]. Alexander et al. also showed that HDL was significantly increased in all multiple-dose groups compared to placebo. Nevertheless, the highest difference was achieved with 60 mg every four weeks (p < 0.0001) at 92 days follow-up [21]. In addition, Bergmark et al. reported significant differences with the same HDL increase (39.6 %) between every dosing group (50 mg and 80 mg) and placebo at 6-month follow-up (p < 0.0001) [20]. The complete data on the effect of olezarsen on HDL changes were available as Supplementary Table 5 (https://www.j-saudi-heart.com/cgi/editor.cgi?article=1439&window=additional_files&context=jsha).Mixed-effect regression was performed from Bergmark et al. and Tardif et al. studies. From regression, the linear model resulted in a significant dose coefficient, but the spline model offers a greater log-likelihood with significant results. The knots were placed at doses of 40 mg, 50 mg, and 80 mg. The intercept of the model was significantly positive, setting up a high baseline for MD when the dose is zero (10.83; 95 % CI: 8.51 to 13.15, p < 0.0001). From the spline model, the first spline term (spline dose 1), the dose coefficient for dosing less than 50 mg was significantly positive (0.57; 95 % CI: 0.52 to 0.63, p < 0.001), indicating that as the dose increased up to approximately 50 mg, the MD consistently increased. The relationship between dose and MD was shifted when the dose exceeded 50 mg. The second spline (spline dose 2) had a negative dose coefficient (−1.00; 95 % CI: −1.15 to −0.84, p < 0.0001). Although spline dose 2 had a negative effect on MD, the significant negative impact at low dose was suspected to shift all predicted MD values to increase across all observed doses. From this result, increasing the olezarsen dose above 50 mg may result in less or no effect on HDL levels. The spline regression illustration is available in Fig. 6, and the prediction value is available in the Supplementary Table 6 (https://www.j-saudi-heart.com/cgi/editor.cgi?article=1439&window=additional_files&context=jsha).3.6. Safety analysisAll included studies provided safety outcomes related to olezarsen [11,20–22]. No deaths were observed across all dosing cohorts in all studies [11,20–22]. Serious AEs were reported in Stroes et al., with none being drug-related cases [22]. Liver function was well-tolerated, with no significant alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevations in four studies [11,20–22]. In renal function markers, Bergmark et al. noted a 10 % incidence of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decrease by at least 30 % in the 50 mg olezarsen group and 7 % in the 80 mg olezarsen group, although these changes were not statistically significant [20]. Alexander et al. and Stroes et al. reported no significant renal function alteration across dosing cohorts. In terms of hematological safety, Tardif et al. noted no significant platelet count reductions (below 100,000/mm3), and Stroes et al. found no substantial changes in all hematological parameters [11,20–22]. Mild injection site reactions, primarily erythema, were reported in 6.7–15.6 % of patients. The weekly 15 mg cohort in Alexander et al. had a lower rate (6.7 %), while Tardif et al. reported 15.6 % and Stroes et al. observed 14 % in the olezarsen group [11,21,22].Overall, across the four studies, olezarsen was well-tolerated, with AEs primarily mild to moderate in severity. Serious AEs were infrequent and not considered related to the drug, and there were no notable differences in key safety parameters such as liver function, renal function, or platelet counts across different dosing regimens. These findings suggest that olezarsen has a favorable safety profile across varying doses and patient populations.4.DiscussionsOlezarsen is a novel GalNAc-modified antisense oligonucleotide drug that effectively inhibits Apo-C3 [11,20–23]. Its inhibition involves binding to the messenger RNA (mRNA) that encodes the Apo-C3 gene. This binding triggers RNase H, an enzyme that degrades the mRNA strand bound to olezarsen [24–26]. As a result, Apo-C3 mRNA translation is effectively eliminated, making olezarsen a powerful Apo-C3 inhibitor.The inhibitory effect on Apo-C3 is followed by multiple lipid cascade metabolism-related consequences. The primary consequences are elevated LPL enzyme activity, which mediates the hydrolysis of triglycerides and their elimination from the bloodstream [27,28]. Apo-C3 reduction also lowers the hepatic secretion of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), which is the primary carrier of triglycerides [29]. Furthermore, Apo-C3 suppression may alter the expression of lipogenic genes, inactivating transcription factors such as sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c), which Apo-C3 previously activated [29–31]. Every part of this cascade contributes to a significant reduction in plasma triglycerides, which was confirmed based on our meta-analysis. The result of this analysis was further found to be robust based on our sensitivity analysis, as no significant alteration in effect size was observed. Therefore, olezarsen is further designed and suitable for severe hypertriglyceridemia, particularly for inherited conditions such as FCS and high cardiovascular risk dyslipidemia, which are unresponsive to lifestyle changes or other triglyceride-lowering drugs such as fibrates [22].Beyond the major reduction of triglyceride levels by olezarsen, our study emphasizes and confirms a significant increase in plasma HDL, a finding that was not highlighted in previous studies [17]. This elevation in HDL is thought to be linked with enhanced catabolism of TRL as LPL activity rises by olezarsen, which promotes TRL conversion into HDL particles [32,33]. Another key factor contributing to the significant elevation of HDL involves the increased of cholesterol efflux via adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), leading to a great amount of HDL formation [33–35]. Additionally, olezarsen decreases lipid exchange between HDL and TRL, mediated by cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), and reduces hepatic lipase activity, enabling to maintain higher plasma HDL through these interrelated mechanisms [36,37].Although olezarsen shows promise as a lipid-lowering medication by reducing Apo-C3 and triglycerides and increasing HDL, its effectiveness on LDL has been restricted. While Apo-C3 is known to be present in LDL particles, olezarsen most effectively acts by regulating TRL. Therefore, inhibiting Apo-C3 has minimal to no effect on LDL levels [6,38]. This evaluation underscores the usage of olezarsen as an advanced and second-line therapy drug in dyslipidemia. In clinical settings, while olezarsen is currently utilized primarily for FCS with hypertriglyceridemia, it could potentially be applied to general dyslipidemia, particularly with high cardiovascular risk. However, it should be used as an adjunct to first-line therapies, such as statins [11,20–22,38].Our findings are consistent with the NWMA by Mahmoud et al., which showed overlapping confidence intervals for the 50 mg and 80 mg doses of olezarsen [13]. However, Mahmoud et al.’s study primarily aimed to compare multiple agents and doses, and did not include a dose-response model to quantify incremental effects or saturation points [13]. In contrast, our study uniquely implements spline-based dose-response modeling, revealing that while both 50 mg and 80 mg are effective, the marginal benefit beyond 50 mg diminishes, suggesting a plateauing effect. This diminished response may be attributed to the saturation of RNA-binding sites as the antisense oligonucleotide dose escalates [20,39]. Additionally, the body’s compensatory mechanisms may dampen the drug’s impact, potentially serving as the protective response to prevent toxicity. For instance, higher doses of olezarsen may greatly alter lipid transport by suppressing SREBPs, influencing cholesterol efflux via ABCA1, and affecting HDL remodeling through CETP. This great alteration, along with over-inhibition of Apo-C3, could disrupt the balance in lipoprotein metabolism, hence the body’s compensatory activation, which leads to less pronounced changes in triglycerides and HDL levels [31,34,36,40,41]. Furthermore, this plateau effect is also assumed to be an indicator that the dosing has reached an optimal level, ensuring efficacy without triggering harmful side effects [20,42].From the safety parameter, olezarsen demonstrated a positive outcome with no major AEs or deaths observed in this analysis. Although Apo-C3 is largely formed in the liver and most of this drug’s metabolism occurs in the liver, none of the liver parameters have been significantly impaired. Olezarsen also provides a safe outcome regarding renal and hematological parameters, with no clinically substantial changes. These findings highlight the advantages of olezarsen over its predecessor, volanesorsen, which requires dosage adjustment due to a significant risk of thrombocytopenia [15,43].To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first dose-response meta-analysis of olezarsen in dyslipidemia, combined with an in-depth systematic review of its efficacy and safety. However, several limitations of this study should be acknowledged. The main limitation of this study is the small sample size and the small number of studies included. There was also high heterogeneity in the meta-analysis of triglyceride changes, which may be affected due to a diverse set of dyslipidemia populations and baseline characteristics. In the dose-response effect, for several scenarios, we use the cumulative olezarsen dose in four weeks, while giving the same cumulative dose with a week-interval may have different effects compared to the single dose at four weeks.Future studies should focus on a larger population, with a more robust investigation in long-term follow-up, particularly investigating its efficacy on MACE. The interaction of olezarsen with other lipid-lowering agents also remains unexplored and should be a priority for future investigation. Additionally, as olezarsen emerges as a promising lipid-lowering drug, its cost-effectiveness and potential for wide distribution must be critically evaluated to ensure it can be available to a broader patient population. Conducting these analyses will be essential in determining whether olezarsen can become a widely adopted therapeutic option in cardiovascular care.5.ConclusionsOlezarsen effectively lowers Apo-C3 and triglycerides while increasing HDL, with minimal effect on LDL. Consistent with prior findings, both 50 mg and 80 mg doses demonstrate significant efficacy. However, our dose-response meta-analysis modeling suggests that 50 mg administered every four weeks may represent the optimal dose, beyond which added benefits diminish. This modeling-based insight refines previous findings by delineating a clearer therapeutic window, reinforcing olezarsen’s role as a novel promising Apo-C3 inhibitor for managing dyslipidemia. Additionally, the favorable safety profile of olezarsen enhances its potential as a preferred medication for inhibiting Apo-C3.Supplementary Information"}

These findings underscore the potential cardiovascular benefits of DPP-4is and their role in improving patient outcomes.", "body": "IntroductionType 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a major global health concern, strongly associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) [1]. The World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes CVD as the leading cause of death among individuals with diabetes, accounting for over 50% of mortalities [2]. These individuals experience a substantially increased risk of serious cardiovascular complications, including myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure [2,3].Effective blood glucose management through medication is paramount in mitigating the elevated cardiovascular risk associated with diabetes [4]. Maintaining tight glycemic control prevents harmful fluctuations that can damage blood vessels and organs over time. Chronically elevated blood glucose contributes to the development of atherosclerosis, characterized by the accumulation of plaque within the arteries [5]. This arterial narrowing increases the risk of restricted blood flow, thrombosis, and subsequent cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction and stroke [5,6]. Persistently high glucose levels also damage the endothelium, the protective inner lining of blood vessels, promoting systemic inflammation[6]. These factors significantly contribute to the burden of CVD mortality in individuals with T2DM [7,8].Given the heightened risk of CVD and mortality in individuals with T2DM, effective glycemic management through pharmacological interventions is essential. While lifestyle modifications play a role in risk reduction, they are often insufficient as the disease progresses [9]. Pharmacological therapies are crucial for achieving and maintaining optimal glycemic control, thereby mitigating the risk of macrovascular and microvascular complications [10].Metformin is the established first-line treatment for T2DM, demonstrating efficacy in lowering HbA1c levels and exhibiting a favorable safety profile compared to other initial therapies [11]. Studies have shown that metformin, compared to sulfonylureas or insulin, is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular events and mortality [12,13]. However, the progressive nature of T2DM, characterized by declining pancreatic beta-cell function, often necessitates the addition of second-line agents to maintain adequate glycemic control over the long term [14].When metformin monotherapy becomes insufficient, the choice of add-on therapy is critical, considering the potential impact on cardiovascular outcomes and mortality. Sulfonylureas (SUs) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4is) are frequently prescribed as second-line agents in combination with metformin [15–18]. They are often used as adjunctive therapies to metformin to further lower blood glucose levels [18,19]. SUs stimulates insulin secretion from pancreatic beta-cells by binding to and closing ATP-sensitive potassium channels, leading to membrane depolarization and calcium influx, which triggers insulin release. This mechanism can increase the risk of hypoglycemia [20]. DPP-4is, conversely, enhance the levels of incretin hormones, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). These incretins promote glucose-dependent insulin release and suppress glucagon secretion [21,22], reducing the risk of hypoglycemia compared to SUs. Metformin, a biguanide, primarily reduces hepatic glucose production and improves insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues. It also modestly reduces intestinal glucose absorption. Unlike SUs, metformin does not directly stimulate insulin secretion and therefore carries a lower risk of hypoglycemia [23,24].While these medications demonstrate efficacy in glycemic control, concerns remain regarding their long-term safety profiles, particularly concerning cardiovascular outcomes when used as add-on therapy to metformin [25]. Further research is needed to better understand and compare the risks associated with these two drug classes.Some studies suggest a higher risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes, including myocardial infarction and stroke, with the use of SUs compared to other antidiabetic medications [25–29]. Some analyses even report increased all-cause mortality with SUs compared to specific alternative treatments [18,27–31]. Conversely, it has been hypothesized that DPP-4is may confer a lower cardiovascular risk when used as add-on therapy to metformin[16,31,32], but further research is required to confirm this hypothesis.Determining the precise cardiovascular safety profiles of DPP-4is plus metformin versus SUs plus metformin remains an area of ongoing investigation. While some studies indicate a higher risk with SUs [16,25–29], the results across the literature have not been entirely consistent [16,17,31–34]. Further high-quality research is necessary to definitively characterize any potential risks and provide more robust evidence. A recent umbrella review by Bashardost et al. (2023) highlighted the complex relationship between metformin, sulfonylureas, and cardiovascular outcomes, emphasizing the need for careful consideration when selecting add-on therapies [35]. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to contribute to this body of knowledge by directly comparing the effects of DPP-4is plus metformin versus SUs plus metformin on cardiovascular outcomes and mortality in patients with T2DM.Materials and methodsStudy design and search strategiesThis systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [36]. The PRISMA checklist is provided in the supporting information file; S1 Checklist. A comprehensive search strategy was implemented across multiple electronic databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, Scopus, and Google Scholar. The search encompassed all available data from database inception to January 1, 2025.The search strategy employed a combination of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and free-text keywords relevant to the research question. Specific terms included, but were not limited to: “sulfonylureas”, “dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors”, “DPP-4 inhibitors”, “gliptins”, “metformin”, “cardiovascular outcomes”, “major adverse cardiovascular events”, “MACE”, “myocardial infarction”, “stroke”, “cardiovascular death”, “all-cause mortality”, “mortality”, and “type 2 diabetes”. The full search strategy for each database is available in S2 Table.Eligibility criteriaStudies were considered eligible for inclusion based on the following criteria:Population.Adults diagnosed with T2DM.Intervention/ Exposure.DPP-4is plus metformin.Comparator.SUs plus metformin.Outcomes.The primary outcomes of interest were MACE, defined as a composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death [37,38], and all-cause mortality.Study design.Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), prospective and retrospective cohort studies, cross-sectional studies, and case-control studies were eligible for inclusion.Data availability.Studies were required to report effect estimates (hazard ratios [HR], odds ratios [OR], or risk ratios [RR]) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs).Language.No language restrictions were applied. Studies published in languages other than English were translated as needed.Studies were excluded based on the following criteriaPublication type.Non-original research articles, including reviews, editorials, letters, commentaries, and case reports were excluded.Intervention/comparator.Studies that investigate DPP-4is or SUs as monotherapy, in combination with other antidiabetic agents (excluding metformin), or that do not directly compare DPP-4is plus metformin to SUs plus metformin.Duplicate data.In cases of multiple publications reporting on the same or overlapping patient populations, only the most comprehensive and recent publication was included to avoid duplication of data.Insufficient data.Studies lacking sufficient data to calculate effect estimates (e.g., HRs, ORs, or RRs with corresponding 95% CIs).Study selectionFollowing the literature search, all identified records were imported into a citation management software (EndNote) for deduplication. Two independent reviewers screened the titles and abstracts of all identified records against the pre-defined eligibility criteria. Full-text articles of potentially eligible studies were retrieved and independently assessed by the same two reviewers. Discrepancies between reviewers at any stage were resolved through discussion and consensus, with a third reviewer consulted if necessary. A PRISMA flow diagram will be presented to illustrate the study selection process in Fig 1.10.1371/journal.pone.0321032.g001Fig 1Flowchart depicting the selected studies for meta-analysis.Data extractionA standardized data extraction form was developed a priori and piloted to ensure consistency and completeness of data collection. Two independent reviewers extracted data from the included studies using the standardized form. Extracted data included study characteristics (author, year, country, study design, sample size, study duration, follow-up duration), participant characteristics (average participant age), intervention and comparator details (number of participants receiving DPP-4is plus metformin, number of participants receiving SUs plus metformin), the list of adjusted variables in each study, and outcome data (effect estimates with 95% CIs). Disagreements were resolved through discussion and consensus, with arbitration by a third reviewer if needed. The completed electronic data extraction form is available in the S2 Table.Quality assessmentThe methodological quality of the included observational studies was appraised using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) [39]. The NOS evaluates the quality of non-randomized studies based on three domains: selection of study groups, comparability of the groups, and ascertainment of exposure and outcome. Each study received a score ranging from zero to nine, with scores below five considered low quality, scores from five to seven considered moderate quality, and scores of eight or higher considered high quality.Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were assessed using the Jadad scale [40], an eight-item tool evaluating various aspects of study quality. Jadad scores range from zero to eight, with scores below four indicating low quality, scores from four to six indicating moderate quality, and scores of seven or higher indicating high quality. While the quality assessment did not result in the exclusion of any studies, it informed sensitivity analyses exploring the influence of study quality on the meta-analysis results. Meta-regression and subgroup analysis stratified by study quality were performed to assess the robustness of the findings. Quality assessment tools are available in S3 Scales.Statistical analysisA rigorous and comprehensive statistical analysis was undertaken to ensure the robustness, validity, and reliability of the synthesized data derived from the included studies. This involved a multi-faceted approach encompassing meta-analysis, a thorough assessment of heterogeneity, exploration of potential sources of heterogeneity, sensitivity analyses to evaluate the stability of findings, subgroup analyses to explore effect modification, assessment of publication bias, and careful handling of missing data. All statistical procedures were performed with meticulous attention to detail to maintain the highest standards of scientific rigor.Meta-analysisThe primary objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to synthesize the available evidence regarding the comparative effectiveness of DPP-4is and SUs as add-on therapies to metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes. To achieve this, we employed meta-analysis techniques to combine effect estimates from individual studies. Recognizing that studies may report outcomes at different time points, we implemented a strategy to maximize data inclusion without introducing bias. For studies that reported effect estimates separately for different exposure durations, we conducted separate meta-analyses, synthesized these stratified estimates, and calculated overall effects within each study. This approach allowed us to capture the full spectrum of available data while avoiding the artificial inflation of sample size that would result from duplicating participant populations. Similarly, if studies provided results stratified by important covariates, such as sex or age groups, but did not report an overall, we performed meta-analyses to combine these stratified effects into a single pooled estimate. In cases where studies presented raw exposure and outcome group data without a calculated effect size, we utilized Stata software to generate RR estimates with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). This ensured consistency in the reporting of effect measures across all included studies.Heterogeneity assessmentA critical aspect of any meta-analysis is the assessment and interpretation of heterogeneity, which refers to the variability in effect estimates across included studies. To address this, we employed a dual approach involving both statistical tests and visual inspection of forest plots. We used Cochran’s Q test, a chi-squared-based test specifically designed for meta-analysis, to determine whether the observed differences in effect estimates were statistically significant (p < 0.10). This test helps to ascertain whether the observed variation is greater than what would be expected by chance alone. Furthermore, we calculated the I² statistic, which quantifies the percentage of total variation across studies that is attributable to heterogeneity rather than sampling error. When substantial heterogeneity (I² ≥ 50% or p < 0.10 for Cochran’s Q test) was detected, we adopted a random-effects model for the meta-analysis [41,42]. This model acknowledges the presence of between-study variation and provides a more conservative estimate of the overall effect. In addition to these statistical tests, we carefully examined forest plots to visually assess the overlap and distribution of confidence intervals across studies. Any study appearing as a potential outlier, with its confidence interval markedly separated from the others, was further investigated through meta-regression, subgroup analyses, and sensitivity analyses to identify potential sources of this heterogeneity.Exploration of heterogeneityMeta-regression.To systematically explore the impact of study-level characteristics on the observed heterogeneity, we conducted both univariate and multivariate meta-regression analyses using Stata software. A range of covariates was considered, including study year, study design, sample size, quality assessment score, geographic region, average age of participants, and follow-up duration. These analyses aimed to identify specific factors that might explain the variation in effect estimates across studies [43].Sensitivity analysis.To evaluate the robustness and stability of our meta-analysis findings, we performed sensitivity analyses by systematically excluding each study one at a time and re-running the meta-analysis. This “leave-one-out” approach helps determine whether any individual study disproportionately influences the overall pooled results. If the overall effect estimates changes substantially after removing a single study, it suggests that the findings may be sensitive to the inclusion of that particular study [44].Subgroup analysis.We conducted subgroup analyses to delve deeper into potential sources of heterogeneity and to investigate whether the observed association between the type of treatment (DPP-4is plus metformin versus SUs plus metformin) and the risk of MACE or all-cause mortality varied across different study characteristics. Subgroups were defined based on factors such as study year, study design, sample size, quality assessment score, geographic region, average age of participants, and follow-up duration. These analyses provided a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between treatment and outcomes and allowed for more specific interpretations of the findings within particular subgroups [45].Assessment of publication bias.Publication bias, the tendency for studies with positive or statistically significant findings to be published more frequently than studies with negative or non-significant findings, can distort the results of a systematic review. To mitigate this risk, we assessed publication bias using both graphical and statistical methods. Funnel plots, which plot the effect size of each study against its precision (typically the standard error), were visually inspected for asymmetry. Asymmetry in the funnel plot can suggest the presence of publication bias. In addition to visual inspection, we employed Egger’s regression test and Begg’s adjusted rank correlation test to statistically evaluate the likelihood of publication bias [42,46].Missing data.Inevitably, in any systematic review, some studies may have missing data for certain variables. To maintain the integrity and accuracy of our analyses, we adopted a transparent approach to handling missing data. We excluded variables with missing data from specific analyses that required complete datasets. This exclusion was particularly relevant for more complex statistical techniques, such as meta-regression and subgroup analyses, which necessitate fully populated datasets to yield reliable and interpretable results.Software.All data analyses were performed using Stata 17 software, ensuring rigorous and reliable synthesis of the evidence [47].ResultsCharacteristics of included studiesA comprehensive literature search yielded 1,312 articles. After removing 483 duplicates, 829 articles were screened. Based on predefined eligibility criteria, 783 articles were excluded, primarily due to irrelevance to the research question, inappropriate study design, or lack of necessary data. This left 46 potentially eligible studies. Fourteen articles were further excluded for not reporting or enabling the calculation of effect sizes, five were excluded for comparing treatment regimens other than SUs or DPP-4is as add-on therapy to metformin, and 2 articles were excluded because they were reviews. This rigorous screening process resulted in 25 studies that met all inclusion criteria. Reference list screening of these included studies identified two additional eligible articles, yielding a final total of 27 studies included in this systematic review and meta-analysis [15–19,25–34,48–59]. These studies encompassed a total of 1,505,821 participants (Fig 1).Relationship between DPP-4is plus metformin versus SUs plus metformin on the Risk of MACETwenty-one studies, published between 2012 and 2024, investigated the association between DPP-4is plus metformin versus SUs plus metformin and the risk of MACE in individuals with T2DM[15–18,25–29,31–34,48,49,53,55–59]. These studies represented diverse geographic locations, including the USA, UK, Germany, Denmark, Taiwan, South Korea, and Italy.

The pooled RR of 0.79 (95% CI: 0.73–0.84; p<0.001) represents a 21% risk reduction. These findings corroborate previous research highlighting the cardiovascular benefits of DPP-4is [27,48,50,53,60]. Similarly, the analysis revealed a statistically significant reduction in all-cause mortality among patients receiving DPP-4is plus metformin versus to those receiving SUs plus metformin, with a pooled RR of 0.79 (95% CI: 0.71–0.88; p<0.001), consistent with prior studies [19,50,51].Several studies support these findings. Ou et al. (2015) observed lower relative risks of all-cause mortality (RR 0.63, 95% CI: 0.55–0.72), ischemic stroke (RR 0.68, 95% CI: 0.55–0.83), and hypoglycemia (RR 0.43, 95% CI: 0.33–0.56) in a cohort of 10,089 individuals with T2DM treated with DPP-4is plus metformin compared to SUs plus metformin [29]. A meta-analysis by Monami et al. of 115 first-line diabetes treatment studies, including seven RCTs comparing SUs and DPP-4is, reported a significantly lower risk of MACE in the DPP-4is group, primarily driven by a reduction in ischemic strokes [61]. Other meta-analyses have shown similar trends, with one reporting an OR of 0.53 (95% CI: 0.32–0.87) for cardiovascular events with DPP-4is versus SUs [62], and another demonstrating statistically significant increased risks of myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality with SUs compared to DPP-4is [63]. Network meta-analyses have also suggested a lower risk of myocardial infarction with DPP-4is compared to SUs (OR 0.41, 95% CI: 0.24–0.71) [64] and a lower MACE risk (RR 0.76, 95% CI: 0.59–0.99) [65]. However, a larger network meta-analysis evaluating all glucose-lowering agents found no significant differences in myocardial infarction, cardiovascular mortality, or all-cause mortality between DPP-4is and SUs [66]. It is crucial to note that these studies evaluated these medications as first-line monotherapy or in combination with other agents, not specifically as add-on therapy to metformin.When DPP-4is are combined with metformin as an adjunctive treatment, they reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases and mortality through several interconnected mechanisms. Firstly, this combination offers better glucose control compared to adding SUs [67]. Effective blood glucose management mitigates risk factors associated with cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, and inflammation [29]. Improved glucose control directly contributes to reducing the incidence of cardiovascular diseases and subsequent mortality [17,18]. Secondly, the addition of DPP-4is to metformin carries a lower risk of hypoglycemia compared to SUs [29]. Hypoglycemia can trigger adverse cardiovascular events, including arrhythmias, myocardial infarctions, and strokes [68]. By minimizing the risk of hypoglycemia, the combination of DPP-4is and metformin helps maintain cardiovascular health and reduce mortality risks [68,69]. Additionally, DPP-4is may have unique mechanisms of action that contribute to their protective effect against cardiovascular diseases [70]. These mechanisms could involve modulating the incretin system or other pathways involved in cardiovascular health. Although their precise mechanisms are still under investigation, their impact on reducing cardiovascular risk and mortality is evident [71,72]. Importantly, these reasons are interconnected, and the reduction in cardiovascular diseases directly contributes to the observed decrease in mortality rates. However, further research is necessary to fully understand the underlying mechanisms and confirm the observed benefits [72].While this comprehensive meta-analysis provides compelling evidence suggesting that DPP-4is add-on therapy to metformin may be associated with a lower risk of MACE and all-cause mortality compared to SU add-on therapy, it’s crucial to acknowledge the limitations inherent in the predominantly observational nature of the included studies. Observational designs are more susceptible to biases, including residual confounding, which can influence the accuracy of effect estimates. Furthermore, the relatively short average follow-up duration of approximately 3–4 years in the included studies may limit the ability to capture less frequent events and fully assess long-term outcomes.It is worth acknowledging that the two large randomized controlled trials analyzed in this meta-analysis did not find a statistically significant difference in overall mortality or MACE between the DPP-4is plus metformin treatment groups compared to SUs plus metformin groups [26,56]. However, it is important to note that these trials were not specifically designed or powered to directly compare the cardiovascular risks associated with these two medication classes.While further randomized controlled trials with longer follow-up are still needed to definitively establish the cardiovascular safety advantages, the current body of evidence from both observational research and randomized trials suggests that DPP-4is have a similar or potentially lower risk profile compared to SUs when used in combination with metformin. Continued research in larger and longer-term trials is necessary to gain further clarity on any differences in cardiovascular outcomes between these commonly used antidiabetic drug classes.Clinical implicationsThis meta-analysis suggests a potential clinical advantage for DPP-4is over SUs in reducing MACE and all-cause mortality when used as add-on therapy to metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes. While current guidelines, including the American Diabetes Association (ADA) Standards of Medical Care [73] and the consensus report from the ADA and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) [74], prioritize GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and SGLT2 inhibitors as second-line agents, particularly in patients with or at high risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), our findings suggest that the role of DPP-4is in this context may warrant reconsideration. Clinical decision-making should be individualized, incorporating patient-specific factors such as cost, contraindications, comorbidities, and patient preferences when choosing between DPP-4is, SUs, or other second-line agents.LimitationsThis review has several limitations that should be considered when interpreting the findings. We observed heterogeneity across the included studies, likely due to variations in study design, population characteristics (e.g., age, comorbidities, baseline cardiovascular risk), and follow-up duration. The inclusion of observational studies introduces the possibility of residual confounding, even after statistical adjustments. Unmeasured or imperfectly measured confounders could influence the observed associations. While our assessment did not reveal statistically significant publication bias, its presence cannot be entirely ruled out. Limited data on specific subgroups restrict the generalizability of our findings to certain populations. Further research is needed to explore the effects of DPP-4is and SUs in diverse patient subgroups. Variations in metformin dosage and background therapies across studies may have influenced the results. Our focus on MACE and all-cause mortality necessitates further research exploring other relevant outcomes, such as microvascular complications (e.g., nephropathy, retinopathy, neuropathy) and quality of life.ConclusionThis meta-analysis of 27 studies, encompassing over 1.5 million participants, suggests that adding a DPP-4is to metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin alone is associated with significantly lower risks of major adverse cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality compared to adding an SU. These findings support the potential preferential use of DPP-4is over SUs as second-line therapy in conjunction with metformin to improve cardiovascular and mortality outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes. Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms driving these observed benefits and to confirm these findings in diverse populations and with longer follow-up durations.Supporting informationS1 ChecklistPRISMA 2020 checklist.(PDF)S2 TablesSearch strategy and extracted information.(PDF)S3 ScalesStudy quality assessment scales.(PDF)"}
{"PMCID": "11836730", "title": "Subclinical atrial fibrillation/atrial high-rate episodes: what significance and decision-making?", "abstract": "AbstractSubclinical atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial high-rate episodes (AHREs) are often detected incidentally through cardiac implantable electronic devices or wearables, especially in asymptomatic patients. These episodes pose a clinical challenge as they are associated with an increased risk of stroke, albeit at a lower rate compared with clinical AF. This review discusses the evolving understanding of AHRE, highlighting the uncertainties regarding optimal management, particularly the use of oral anticoagulants. Two key trials, ARTESiA and NOAH-AFNET 6, investigated anticoagulation in patients with device-detected AHRE. ARTESiA found that apixaban significantly reduced stroke or systemic embolism, but with an increased risk of major bleeding. In contrast, NOAH-AFNET 6, which tested edoxaban, did not demonstrate a significant benefit in reducing cardiovascular events but also observed higher bleeding rates. A meta-analysis of these trials confirmed the efficacy of oral anticoagulants in lowering ischaemic stroke risk, though with an elevated bleeding risk. Given these findings, clinical decision-making in patients with AHRE must be individualized, taking into account stroke risk, bleeding risk, and patient preferences. Shared decision-making is crucial to balance the benefits and risks of anticoagulation, especially in the context of progression to clinical AF and its associated stroke risk. Moreover, it is essential to educate patients about the risk of bleeding complications and emphasize the importance of close monitoring. Future research may further clarify optimal anticoagulation strategies and better define high-risk subgroups that would most benefit from therapy.", "body": "Sub-clinical atrial fibrillation and atrial high-rate episodes: from the definition to the clinical implicationsAtrial fibrillation (AF) is a complex condition that can present as symptomatic arrhythmia or, quite frequently, as an asymptomatic event.1,2 It is often detected incidentally through a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), Holter monitoring, or even via modern technology like smartphones and smartwatches, referred to as wearables.3–5A diagnosis of ‘clinical AF’6,7 is established when AF is documented on a 12-lead ECG or through an ECG rhythm strip that shows at least 30 s of AF.Cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) with atrial sensing capabilities6,7 provide extensive options for monitoring cardiac rhythm. These devices—including pacemakers, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, cardiac resynchronization therapy devices, and implantable loop recorders—have significantly enhanced our understanding of the temporal dynamics of atrial tachyarrhythmias.The term atrial high-rate episodes (AHREs) can be applied when a CIED detects an atrial tachyarrhythmia in a patient with no prior history of AF, absence of symptoms typical of AF, and no detection of AF at a conventional 12-lead ECG, provided that noise or artefacts are excluded by analysis of the recorded tracing. The term subclinical AF has been used, like a synonym, when the arrhythmic nature of AHRE is confirmed by visually revision of intra-cardiac electrograms or ECG-recorded rhythm strips.5,6 Most recently, the term device-detected subclinical AF has been proposed for AF detected through continuous monitoring devices, including CIEDs and consumer-based wearable monitors.The characterization of AHRE was analysed in the last 15 years by a series of observational studies that showed that AHRE/subclinical AF are quite common, especially in elderly patients, with up to 30% of patients experiencing AHRE ≥5–6 min during follow-up ranging from 1 to 3 years. Atrial high-rate episodes ≥5–6 min are associated with around a two-fold increased risk of stroke, thus differing from the five-fold increase reported for clinical AF.6 The risk of stroke/systemic embolism increases according to AF burden and CHA2DS2-VASc. However, the precise cut-off of a single AF episode duration or daily AF burden associated with a substantial increase in the risk was not established in observational studies since thresholds ranging from 5–6 min to 1 h, to 5.5 h or even 24 h were identified.5,6What implications for anticoagulation after ARTESiA and NOAH-AFNET 6 trials?In patients with AHRE, the lack of clear indications to anticoagulation and the need to assess the possible risk–benefit ratio of oral anticoagulants in this setting led 8–10 years ago to plan two randomized controlled trials, the Apixaban for the Reduction of Thrombo-Embolism in Patients with Device-detected Subclinical AF (ARTESiA) trial and the Non-vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants in Patients with Atrial High-Rate Episodes (NOAH-AFNET 6) trial7–10 (Table 1). These two studies differed for the entry criteria for AHRE (between 6 min and 24 h in ARTESiA, >6 min in NOAH-AFNET 6 without an upper limit of AHRE duration), for the oral anticoagulant tested in the intervention arm (apixaban in ARTESiA and edoxaban in NOAH-AFNET 6), and also for the control arm (aspirin 81 mg in ARTESiA),10 aspirin or placebo, at the discretion of investigators, in NOAH-AFNET 6, which however included aspirin in around half of enrolled patients.9 As shown in Table 1, the primary endpoint differed significantly between the two trials: in NOAH-AFNET 6, cardiovascular mortality was included in a composite with stroke and systemic embolism, whereas in ARTESiA, the endpoint was limited to stroke and systemic embolism alone.Table 1Summary of the main characteristics and results of the NOAH-AFNET 69 and ARTESiA10 randomized controlled trials and results of the study-level meta-analysis based on these two trials NOAH-AFNET 6 trialARTESiA trialStudy-level meta-analysis including NOAH-AFNET 6 and ARTESiA trialsPatients characteristics according to eligibility criteriaPatients with age ≥65 year and >1 additional CHA2DS2-VASc risk factor (except sex) or age ≥75 year and with SCAF episodes ≥6 min detected on CIEDsPatients with age ≥55 year, CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥3, and SCAF episodes ≥6 min to <24 h detected on CIEDsDuration of AHRE/SCAF episodes required for enrolment in the studyAt least one episode (atrial rate ≥170/min) ≥6 min, no upper limitAt least one episode (atrial rate ≥175/min) ≥6 min, but no single episode ≥24 hTested treatment with oral anticoagulationEdo 60 mg (30 mg with pre-specified dose reduction criteria) once dailyApi 5 mg (2.5 mg with pre-specified dose reduction criteria) twice dailyDOAC(Edo or Api)Control treatmentPla or Asa 100 mg once daily (when clinically indicated)Asa 81 mg once dailyPla or AsaOpen-label prescription of aspirinIn 54% of the Pla groupIn 57% of the patients as open labelNumber of enrolled patients25361270 Edo analysed1266 Pla analysed40122015 Api analysed1997 Asa analysed6548Follow-up durationMedian 21 monthsMean 3.5 ± 1.8 yearsPrimary efficacy endpointComposite of stroke or systemic embolism or CV deathComposite of stroke or systemic embolismPrimary safety endpointComposite of death from any cause or major bleedingMajor bleedingIschaemic stroke No. of patients (% or % per patient-year)22 Edo (0.9%), 27 Pla (1.1%)(% per patient-year)HR 0.79 (0.45–1.39)45 Api (0.64%), 71 Asa (1.02%)(% per patient-year)HR 0.62 (0.43–0.91)67 DOAC (2.0%), 98 Pla/Asa (3.0%)RR 0.68 (0.50–0.92)All-cause stroke or systemic embolism No. of patients (%)23 Edo (1.8%), 33 Pla (2.6%)RR 0.69 (0.41–1.18)55 Api (2.7%), 86 Asa (4.3%)RR 0.63 (0.45–0.88)78 DOAC (2.4%), 119 Pla/Asa (3.6%)RR 0.65 (0.49–0.86)Major bleeding No. of patients (% or % per patient-year)53 Edo (2.1%), 25 Pla (1.0%)(% per patient-year)HR 2.10 (1.30–3.38)106 Api (1.53%), 78 Asa (1.12%)(% per patient-year)HR 1.36 (1.01–1.82)159 DOAC (4.8%), 103 Pla/Asa (3.2%)RR 1.62 (1.05–2.50)Fatal bleeding No. of patients (%)2 Edo (0.2%), 1 Pla (0.1%)RR 1.99 (0.18–21.96)10 Api (0.5%), 14 Asa (0.7%)RR 0.7 (0.32–1.59)12 DOAC (0.4%), 15 Pla/Asa (0.5%)RR 0.79 (0.37–1.69)All-cause death No. of patients (% or % per patient-year)111 Edo (4.3%), 94 Pla (3.7%)(% per patient-year)HR 1.16 (0.88–1.53)362 Api (5.06%), 341 (4.82%)(% per patient-year)HR 1.04 (0.90–1.21)473 DOAC (14.4%), 435 Pla/Asa (13.3%)RR 1.08 (0.96–1.21)Api, apixaban; Asa, acetylsalicylic acid; CIED, cardiac implantable electronic device; CV, cardiovascular; DOAC, direct oral anticoagulant; Edo, edoxaban; HR, hazard ratio; Pla, placebo; RR, relative risk; SCAF, subclinical atrial fibrillation.The NOAH-AFNET 6 trial recruited 2536 subjects with an average age of 78 years and subclinical AF episodes with an average duration of 2.8 h, randomized to receive either edoxaban or placebo.9 The primary endpoint of the study consisted of death from cardiovascular causes, stroke, or systemic embolism. The study was stopped prematurely after a mean follow-up of 21 months based on recommendations from the data and safety monitoring board and the steering committee, owing to safety concerns, and based on the results of an informal assessment of futility for the efficacy of edoxaban.9At the conclusion of the trial, the primary endpoint was observed in 3.2% of the treated group and 4% of the placebo group [hazard ratio (HR) 0.81; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.60–1.08; P = 0.15]. The incidence of stroke was ∼1% per patient-year in both the groups. The decision to include cardiovascular death as a primary endpoint in this trial is debatable, as cardiovascular death is largely influenced by underlying heart disease and comorbidities, and fewer than 10% of all deaths may be related to stroke. As a matter of fact, this diminishes the likelihood of demonstrating a positive effect of anticoagulants.The composite endpoint of total mortality and major bleeding was observed in 5.9% of the edoxaban group compared with 4.5% in the placebo group (HR 1.31; 95% CI 1.02–1.67; P = 0.03). Patients receiving edoxaban experienced a doubled risk of major bleeding (Table 1), with an average of 0.06 ± 0.35 events per patient-year. There was no significant difference in all-cause mortality between edoxaban and placebo groups. Clinical AF developed in 18.2% of the enrolled patients (8.7% per patient-year). The authors of the NOAH-AFNET 6 trial concluded that in patients with AHRE treated with edoxaban, the incidence of composite outcome of cardiovascular death, stroke, or systemic embolism did not differ from placebo, but treatment with edoxaban led to a higher incidence of the composite endpoint of death or major bleeding.9A secondary pre-specified analysis of the NOAH-AFNET 6 trial by Becher et al.11 examined interactions between AHRE duration at baseline, with a specific focus on AHRE > 24 h and anticoagulation with edoxaban compared with placebo. Atrial high-rate episode >24 h were present at baseline in 259/2389 patients, with clinical characteristics non-different from patients with shorter AHRE. The primary outcome occurred in 9/132 patients with AHRE > 24 h (2 strokes) treated with anticoagulation and in 14/127 patients treated with placebo (2 strokes). The small number of events indicates that the statistical power of this analysis was very low.The results of the ARTESiA trial may appear at first look quite conflicting when compared with the results of the NOAH-AFNET 6 trial.10 In the ARTESiA, 4012 patients (mean age 77 years) with device-detected subclinical AF lasting from 6 min to 24 h (with a median longest episode duration of 1.5 h) were randomized to receive either apixaban (2.5 or 5 mg twice daily) or aspirin (81 mg daily). In patients with AF lasting more than 24 h or developing clinical AF, trial medications were discontinued, and oral anticoagulants were initiated as open-label treatment; this occurred in around 24% of the patients, after a median time after randomization of 18.3 months.10 Stroke or systemic embolism (Table 1) was the primary endpoint. After a mean follow-up of 3.5 years, the primary endpoint occurred in 55 patients in the apixaban group compared with 86 in the aspirin group (corresponding to 0.78 and 1.24% per patient-year, HR 0.63; 95% CI 0.45–0.88, P = 0.007). Notably, the incidence of moderately disabling to fatal strokes, as evaluated by the modified Rankin Scale (scores 3–6), was reduced by half in those treated with apixaban. In patients with CHA2DS2-VASc > 4, the benefits of treatment with apixaban in preventing stroke or systemic embolism were greater than the risk of major bleeds.12 Apixaban prevented 0.12 (95% CI: −0.38 to 0.62) strokes or systemic embolism per 100 patient-years and caused 0.33 (95% CI: −0.27 to 0.92) major bleeds, the opposite was true for patients with CHA2DS2-VASc < 4.12 No significant differences were observed in mortality rates. Major bleeding, evaluated through an on-treatment analysis, was more common in the apixaban group (HR 1.81; 95% CI 1.26–2.57, P = 0.04). A similar trend was observed for gastrointestinal bleeding (HR 1.76, 95% CI 1.13–2.74). However, there were no significant differences in the rates of fatal bleeding or symptomatic intracranial haemorrhages. Most cases of major bleeding responded promptly to supportive care, and haemodynamic instability was uncommon.A key finding from both the ARTESiA and NOAH-AFNET 6 trials is that the risk of stroke or systemic embolism associated with AHRE/subclinical AF is ∼1–1.2% per patient-year, which is lower than that seen with clinical AF. However, this should not understate the impact on patient outcomes, as 43% of strokes occurring in the aspirin group of the ARTESiA trial resulted in significant disability or death. When evaluating the risk–benefit ratio of anticoagulants for patients with AHRE or subclinical AF, it is crucial to differentiate between the reduction in stroke risk and the increase in major bleeding risk. Studies have shown discrepancies in how stroke and bleeding risks are perceived by patients vs. physicians. Physicians often view bleeding risks as more significant, while patients tend to prioritize the risk of stroke more strongly when compared with physicians.According to AF guidelines, the threshold for stroke incidence that justifies oral anticoagulation is set at ∼1% per year and this corresponds to the actual risk of stroke found in AHRE/subclinical AF under placebo or aspirin in NOAH-AFNET 6 and ARTESiA.In numerical terms and in an intention-to-treat approach, the results of ARTESiA suggest that oral anticoagulation results in 4.6 fewer strokes/embolic events per thousand patient-years, despite resulting in 4.1 additional major bleeding events per thousand patient-years. However, we should carefully consider, from the perspective of patient values, that the significant reduction in disabling strokes vs. aspirin of ARTESiA is far more meaningful for patients, their families, and the community, than the clinical implications of increased major bleeding by apixaban. Most of these bleeding events (90%) were managed conservatively, using transfusions when needed, and without increase in fatal bleedings or deaths.10Any interpretation of the apparent discrepancies between ARTESiA and NOAH-AFNET 6 trials must consider that the conclusions of the latter study were significantly influenced by its premature termination, which adversely affected the trial’s statistical power.However, an important clarification is provided by the study-level meta-analysis based on ARTESiA and NOAH-AFNET 6, published by McIntyre et al.13 that involved authors of both trials. This meta-analysis, incorporating data from NOAH-AFNET 6 (2536 participants) and ARTESiA (4012 participants; Table 1), demonstrated consistent results regarding the reduction of ischaemic stroke with oral anticoagulants [relative risk (RR) 0.68, 95% CI 0.50–0.92, I2 statistic for heterogeneity = 0%; high-quality evidence]. Furthermore, the analysis revealed that oral anticoagulation was found to reduce the composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, all-cause stroke, peripheral arterial embolism, myocardial infarction, or pulmonary embolism (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.73–1.00, I2 = 0%; moderate-quality evidence). The meta-analysis found no significant differences in rates of cardiovascular death (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.76–1.17, I2 = 0%; moderate-quality evidence) or all-cause mortality (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.96–1.21, I2 = 0%; moderate-quality evidence). It also noted that oral anticoagulation was associated with an increased risk of major bleeding (RR 1.62, 95% CI 1.05–2.5, I2=61%; high-quality evidence), but no significant difference was observed in fatal bleeding rates (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.37–1.69, I2 = 0%, moderate-quality evidence).13Based on current knowledge, we believe that in patients with AHRE/subclinical AF detected through an implanted device, decision-making should be individualized. This approach should consider that in patients at risk of stroke, as indicated by the CHA2DS2-VASc score, anticoagulants significantly lower the risk of stroke, especially the risk of disabling or fatal stroke. This favourable effect is associated with an increased risk of major bleeding that can be managed conservatively in 90% of cases with no increase in fatal bleeding or death.In this context, patients with AHRE/subclinical AF should be adequately informed about the expected benefit and the risk–benefit ratio of anticoagulation. Shared decision-making between clinicians and patients is crucial, taking into account individual values and preferences as well as an appropriate management of associated conditions and comorbidities with the correction of modifiable risk factors for bleeding.Additionally, clinical decision-making should also consider that, on average, around one of five patients with device-detected AF (traditionally named AHRE or subclinical AF) will progress to clinical AF or long-duration AHRE (>24 h) within a 2 year follow-up. This progression inherently increases risk of stroke, particularly in patients with a higher CHADS2 or CHA2DS2-VASc and/or a higher baseline AF burden. Data from the NOAH-AFNET 6 trial confirm that progression to clinical AF is more frequent when device-detected AHRE lasts more than 24 h, with the rate of progression to clinical AF doubling (17% per patient-year) compared with shorted AHRE.11Remote monitoring of CIEDs offers detailed notifications regarding the presence and duration of AHREs/subclinical AF episodes, providing tracings with arrhythmia electrograms. This capability has significantly enhanced its clinical value for both patients with and without heart failure.14,15Future analyses of ARTESiA and NOAH-AFNET 6 data are anticipated to provide additional information on other specific patients’ subgroups with a higher likelihood of progression to clinical AF, as well as identifying those patients who can achieve the maximal net benefit from anticoagulation, based on clinical characterization at baseline.16,17 From a clinical perspective, examining the relationship between AHRE/subclinical AF and atrial cardiomyopathy is essential. Understanding how the degree of dysfunction in atrial structure and function correlates with stroke risk could greatly enhance predictive accuracy. Furthermore, exploring the progression from brief episodes of AHRE or subclinical AF to longer durations of clinical AF will offer valuable insights into patient risk and inform management strategies.ConclusionsThe NOAH-AFNET 6 and ARTESiA trials offer significant insights for clinical decision-making in everyday practice. In patients with AF and in patients with subclinical AF/AHRE, reduction of strokes, especially disabling strokes, through effective treatment with oral anticoagulants is a primary objective, in the perspective of the patient and of the community. Recent evidence indicates that this crucial aim can be achieved also in patients with AF identified through the extended diagnostics of CIEDs. Achieving this goal necessitates a clinically focused, patient-centred approach that includes tailored assessments of the risks and benefits of oral anticoagulants, which should be communicated with well-informed and empowered patients."}

Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the evidence examining differences in peak V˙O2 (primary objective) and its determinants (secondary objectives) between patients with HF with reduced (HFrEF) or preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).MethodsStudies comparing peak V˙O2 in HFrEF vs HFpEF were found through PubMed (1967-2024), Scopus (1981-2024), and Web of Science (1985-2024). Data extraction and methodologic quality assessment were completed by 2 independent coders. Differences between HFrEF and HFpEF were compared using weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) derived from random effects meta-analysis.ResultsAfter screening 3107 articles, 25 unique studies were included in the analysis for the primary outcome (HFrEF n = 3783; HFpEF n = 3279). Peak V˙O2 (WMD: –1.6 mL/kg/min, 95% CI: –2.3 to –0.8 mL/kg/min), and peak exercise measures of cardiac output (WMD: –1.1 L/min, 95% CI: –2.1 to –0.2 L/min), stroke volume (WMD: –10.1 mL, 95% CI: –16.6 to –3.7 mL), heart rate (WMD: –4 bpm, 95% CI: –6 to –2 bpm), and left ventricular ejection fraction (WMD: –28.2%, 95% CI: –32.6% to –23.8%) were significantly lower while peak exercise arterial-venous oxygen difference was significantly higher in HFrEF compared with HFpEF (2.3 mL/dL, 95% CI: 1.6-2.9 mL/dL).ConclusionsOur findings highlight distinct physiological impairments along the oxygen cascade in HFrEF compared with HFpEF, with direct implications for the management and treatment strategies of these HF subtypes.", "body": "Heart failure (HF) is a significant global health issue, affecting more than 64 million individuals worldwide.1 Despite advancements in treatment, it remains associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality and reduced quality of life.1 Traditionally, HF has been characterized as 2 main phenotypes—heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)—where HFrEF has been extensively studied, leading to better understanding and established treatments, and HFpEF remains more challenging to study and treat because of its heterogeneous nature, resulting in fewer targeted therapies.2,3A hallmark feature of HF is reduced exercise tolerance, objectively measured by peak oxygen uptake (peak V˙O2).4 Emerging evidence indicates that the degree of impairment in peak V˙O2 and the mechanisms that contribute to this may be associated with the specific HF phenotype. Indeed, exercise intolerance in HFrEF patients are typically considered a result of more significant “central” (cardiac output [CO]) limitations, whereas “noncardiac” peripheral factors (oxygen extraction, measured as arterial-venous oxygen difference [a-vO2 difference]) may more prominently limit exercise tolerance in HFpEF.5,6 Currently, however, a large-scale analysis of the evidence base examining peak V˙O2 and its determinants in HFrEF and HFpEF has not been undertaken. Therefore, the aim of our meta-analysis was to (1) compare peak V˙O2 between patients with HFrEF and HFpEF (primary outcome) and (2) compare the Fick determinants of peak V˙O2 (ie, CO and a-vO2 difference) between these phenotypes.MethodsData sources and search strategyA comprehensive, systematic search was performed in the following bibliographic databases: PubMed (1967-2024), Scopus (1981-2024), and Web of Science (1985-2024). Additional Google Scholar searches were performed through references cited from the studies that met our inclusion criteria. The search strategy for each database used a combination of natural language keywords and subject headings, such as MeSH, wherever they were available. The search strategy was structured using 3 main concepts: (1) heart failure and preserved ejection fraction; (2) heart failure and reduced ejection fraction; and (3) oxygen consumption. A list including all search terms used and the search strategy for each database is provided in the Supplementary Material (Supplemental Appendix S1). Records identified through the database searches were exported in complete batches and imported into the Covidence review software (Covidence, Melbourne, Australia). Ethical approval was not sought as all data were sourced from previously published studies and did not involve any individually identifiable or re-identifiable data.Data synthesis and statistical analysisDifferences in the primary and secondary outcomes were quantified using meta-analysis based on random effects models using the R metacont package (R Core Team 2016, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). From these models, the weighted average effect size, defined as weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), was calculated for each outcome between the HFrEF and HFpEF groups. The weight assigned to each study was the inverse of the variance within study. The larger the sample size and smaller variance of the study, the higher was the assigned weight. Heterogeneity within individual effect sizes was calculated by the I2. Forest plots were created to show individual effect sizes, standard deviations, weights, the weighted average effect size, and the associated P value for testing the significance of the weighted average effect size at the alpha significance level of 0.05.Study selection, inclusion and exclusion criteriaAfter the removal of duplicate citations, 2 study authors (D.W., C.W.) independently screened the titles and abstracts to identify studies comparing HFrEF vs HFpEF. The inclusion criteria consisted of (1) direct comparison of HFrEF and HFpEF patients who were 18 years of age or older and (2) peak V˙O2 measured during a cardiopulmonary exercise test with gas analysis. Studies were excluded if (1) there was no original or duplicate data, (2) it was published in a non-English language, or (3) it was a nonhuman study. The full text of potentially relevant articles was independently reviewed by 2 reviewers (D.E., C.W.) and any discrepancies during the study selection process were resolved by a third adjudicator (M.H.).Study quality assessmentThe quality of the included studies was evaluated using the AXIS appraisal tool,7 a validated 20-point tool designed to assess the quality of cross-sectional studies. According to this tool, a score of 0 to 8 indicates very low quality, whereas a score of 17 to 20 indicates high quality.7ResultsThe initial database search and identification of studies from other methods included 3107 articles. Following full-text screening, 25 unique studies were included in this meta-analysis6,8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 (Fig. 1). In the studies included, based on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), HFrEF was primarily defined by a value below 35% to 50%, with some studies using a more stringent cutoff of ≤40%, whereas HFpEF was characterized by an LVEF ≥50% (Table 1). Additionally, some studies incorporated clinical symptoms, physical signs, and biomarker measurements alongside LVEF assessments to define HF subtypes.Figure 1Study selection.

Finally, 4 studies measured peak exercise CO6,24,25,31 using different techniques (ie, invasive right heart catheterization, echocardiography, or impedance cardiography) and a-vO2 difference, whereas 1 study only reported the latter parameter.16Peak oxygen uptake and hemodynamicsCompared with HFpEF, peak V˙O2 indexed to body mass or as an absolute value (Fig. 2) was lower in HFrEF (n = 7205, WMD: –1.6 mL/kg/min, 95% CI: –2.3 to –0.8 mL/kg/min, I2: 90%; and n = 690, –0.1 L/min, 95% CI: –0.2 to 0.0 L/min, I2: 28%). Analysis of studies assessing central hemodynamics showed that patients with HFrEF had a significantly lower peak exercise CO and cardiac index (n = 814, WMD: –1.1 L/min, 95% CI: –2.1 to –0.2 L/min, I2: 80%, Fig. 3A; and, n = 224, WMD: –1.4 L/min/m2, 95% CI: –1.8 to –1.0 L/min/m2, I2: 0%), heart rate (n = 5697, WMD: –4.2 beats/min, 95% CI: –6.4 to –2.0 beats/min, I2: 41%, Supplemental Fig. S1A), stroke volume and stroke volume index (n = 637, WMD: –10.1 mL, 95% CI: –16.6 to –3.7 mL, I2: 60%; n = 541, –6.4 mL/m2, 95% CI: –8.9 to –3.8 mL/m2, I2: 27%, Supplemental Fig. S1, B and C). Moreover, in individuals with HFrEF, LVEF (n = 814, WMD: –28.2%, 95% CI: –32.6% to –23.8%, I2: 86%, Supplemental Fig. S2A) and systolic and diastolic blood pressure (n = 5467, WMD: –23.8 mm Hg, 95% CI: –27.6 to –20.0 mm Hg, I2: 70%; and, n = 2784, WMD: –3.2 mm Hg, 95% CI: –4.8 to –1.6 mm Hg, I2: 44%, respectively, Supplemental Fig. S3, A and B) were also lower during exercise, whereas end-diastolic volume (absolute and indexed) was significantly higher compared with HFpEF (n = 244, WMD: 73 mL, 95% CI: 21-125 mL, I2: 93%; n = 421, 42.5 mL/m2, 95% CI: 27.2-57.8 mL/m2, I2: 90%, Supplemental Fig. S2, B and C). Finally, peak a-vO2 difference was significantly higher in HFrEF vs HFpEF (n = 934, WMD: 2.3 mL/dL, 95% CI: 1.6-2.9 mL/dL, I2: 70%, Fig. 3B).Figure 2Peak in V˙O2 in patients with HFrEF vs HFpEF.

CI, confidence interval; MD, mean difference; SD, standard deviation.Study quality and biasThe average AXIS score was 14, reflecting a moderate quality level.7 Publication bias was assessed using the both the funnel plot and Egger test. The funnel plot shows approximate symmetry, and the Egger test is nonsignificant with a P value of 0.83, which implies that there is no evidence of publication bias (Supplemental Fig. S4). A high degree of heterogeneity (I2 = 60%-90%) was observed in most outcomes in this analysis. To further explore and address the sources of this heterogeneity, 2 additional approaches were applied: outlier removal and meta-regression analysis. Jehn et al.13 and Wernhart et al.28 were identified as potential outliers because of their exceptionally large effect sizes, the 2 largest among all included studies. The removal of these studies led to a modest reduction in heterogeneity (I2 decreased from 90.0% to 87.5%). Although this reduction in I2 was not large, it demonstrates that these studies introduced some variability that was not consistent with the rest of the studies. Following the outlier removal, meta-regression was conducted to further investigate potential sources of heterogeneity using 3 key covariates: sample size, publication year (dichotomized as ≤2018 vs >2018), and hypertension status. Meta-regression explained 81% of the heterogeneity (R2), reducing I2 to 54%. This significant reduction indicates that these covariates account for a substantial portion of the variability between studies. Smaller studies (P = 0.0009), studies published after 2018 (P = 0.02), and those studies involving hypertensive patients reported larger effect sizes (P = 0.01). However, hypertension status was missing in 32% of the studies, suggesting that more heterogeneity might have been accounted for if complete data were available for this covariate. Other potential moderators, including age, resting systolic blood pressure, resting left-ventricular ejection fraction in the HFrEF group, diabetes status, and medication use (ie, diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or β-blockers), were also explored. These covariates did not explain additional heterogeneity and reduced the model’s explanatory power (R2). This suggests that these factors may not have played a significant role in the variability of effect sizes in this meta-analysis. The role of sex could not be determined as few studies reported results subgrouped by sex.DiscussionThe findings of this meta-analysis of exercise limitations in patients with HF, the largest conducted to date, identifies key differences in HF phenotypes related to peak V˙O2.. Specifically, patients with HFrEF have significantly lower peak V˙O2 than those with HFpEF. In the few studies that measured the Fick determinants, patients with HFrEF showed greater “central” limitations secondary to a lower stroke volume and CO. In contrast, peripheral limitations are a more predominant feature of HFpEF, as peak exercise a-vO2 difference was significantly lower in those with HFpEF vs HFrEF. These findings highlight the differential physiology driving reduced exercise intolerance in HFrEF vs HFpEF and reinforce the importance of using exercise training and rehabilitation strategies that target the “weak links” in the O2 pathway.33Impaired peak V˙O2 in HFrEF and HFpEF: Implications for functional independenceDecreased exercise tolerance is a defining characteristic of HF, regardless of the phenotype. We observed that patients with HFrEF had a peak V˙O2 that was 10% lower than those with HFpEF. This difference holds clinical importance, as it exceeds previously established thresholds for a clinically meaningful difference in peak V˙O2,34 and may contribute to important differences in disability and functional limitations. Indeed, the peak V˙O2 in HFrEF was 19% below the threshold required for full and independent living (18 mL/kg/min),35 whereas in HFpEF, it was only 9% below this threshold. As a result, daily activities demand near-maximal or maximal effort, with more significant impairments expected in HFrEF patients. In addition, the combination of a lower peak exercise CO and lower peak V˙O2 may also explain the higher specific cardiovascular mortality in HFrEF compared with HFpEF.1Peak exercise CO in HFrEF and HFpEFIn accordance with the Fick principle, several important pathophysiological differences may drive the markedly reduced peak V˙O2 values observed in both HF phenotypes. CO and its determinants are crucial in modulating peak V˙O2 in patients with HF. Our findings from the subgroup of studies assessing peak exercise hemodynamics show that CO at peak exercise is 1.1 L/min lower in HFrEF than in HFpEF, mainly because of a lower stroke volume, as the difference in maximal heart rate between groups was minimal (4 beats/min). Four studies included in our analysis measured the determinants of stroke volume during peak exercise6,24,25,31 and consistently reported that HFrEF patients have higher peak exercise end-diastolic volume (index) and concomitantly lower LVEF. Taken together, despite a higher preload, the lower peak exercise stroke volume and LVEF in HFrEF is due to impaired contractility as peak exercise systemic vascular resistance was similar in the 2 studies where it was measured.24,31 In turn, impaired contractility in HFrEF is most likely an effect of altered contractile properties of the myocardium secondary to damaged or necrotic tissue. Abnormal peripheral vascular endothelial function and increased muscle sympathetic nerve activity has been observed to a greater extent in HFrEF vs controls3,36, 37, 38 and may also contribute to higher ventricular afterload during exercise. However, whether this contributes to the greater impairment in peak V˙O2, and CO observed in patients with HFrEF, requires further investigation.Peak a-vO2 difference in HFrEF and HFpEFOur study found that the peak exercise a-vO2 difference was 2.3 mL/dL higher in HFrEF compared to HFpEF, which suggests that patients in the latter group have a greater degree of peripheral impairment than those with HFrEF. However, because of a lower CO (and thus leg blood flow) at peak exercise, HFrEF patients will have a greater time for oxygen to be extracted by the active muscles.33 Alternatively, the lower O2 extraction in HFpEF may be due to heterogeneity in capillary transit time, muscle blood flow heterogeneity, and to abnormal muscle oxygen diffusive conductance (transport of O2 from the red blood cell in the microvasculature to mitochondria in skeletal muscle) even when muscle venous O2 pressure is low.33,39, 40, 41 Indeed, Esposito et al.42 previously reported that muscle oxygen diffusive conductance is 22% to 32% lower in HFrEF patients compared with control subjects during peak cycle exercise or single-leg knee extension exercise where the limiting role of the heart is minimized.No studies have specifically examined the impact of HF phenotype on peak exercise muscle oxygen diffusive conductance. However, comparing findings from several prior invasive hemodynamic studies suggests that the mean muscle oxygen diffusive conductance values for HFrEF are 41% higher than those reported for patients with HFpEF patients during single-leg knee extension exercise.42,43 These differences may be influenced by variations in age (HFrEF: 53 years vs HFpEF: 70 years), sex (HFrEF: 0% females vs HFpEF: 70% females), and body mass (HFrEF: 96 kg vs HFpEF: 106 kg), which individually or collectively affect whole peak exercise VO2 and O2 extraction.33Both HFrEF and HFpEF exhibit similar skeletal muscle abnormalities that include reductions in oxidative enzymes, percentage of type I (oxidative) muscle fibers, volume density of mitochondria, and surface density of mitochondrial cristae.4,44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50 Additionally, there is impaired mitochondrial oxidative capacity, and a reduction in the capillary-to-fiber ratio.3,47, 48, 49,51 Given these morphologic perturbations occur to a similar extent in both HF phenotypes, it is plausible that skeletal muscle quality plays a significant role in the greater impairment in O2 extraction in HFpEF.52 Indeed, patients with HFpEF display greater myosteatosis (increased intermuscular fat relative to skeletal muscle), which is related to a lower peak V˙O2, aerobic endurance, and physical function.53, 54, 55 Furthermore, compared to HFrEF, patients with HFpEF show more rapid depletion of high-energy phosphate during small muscle mass exercise, indicating severe skeletal muscle bioenergetic impairment.56 Thus, indicators associated with skeletal muscle composition and metabolism may be altered to a greater degree in patients with HFpEF, thereby attenuating the increase in a-vO2 difference during peak exercise compared to patients with HFrEF.ConsiderationsThe heterogeneity in our meta-analyses warrants consideration when interpreting our findings. This variability may stem from the moderate quality of included studies—which is not uncommon for HF exercise studies32,57—and may be due to differences in study design, different testing protocols, modalities (upright or supine cycle, treadmill), and exercise termination criteria (often not reported) among the included studies. Moreover, there was variability in the criteria and cutoff points used to define HFrEF and HFpEF groups, which may also have contributed to heterogeneity. Meta-regression analysis revealed that studies with a smaller sample size, those published in 2018 or later, and hypertension status (greater in HFrEF) had a larger effect size. However, hypertension status was missing in 32% of studies, suggesting that more heterogeneity might have been accounted for if complete data were available for this covariate. Importantly, other covariates (diabetes, resting blood pressure, or HF medication) did not explain additional heterogeneity. Consequently, although not a direct aim of this meta-analysis, an important finding is the lack of standardization and insufficient reporting of key details related to the protocols and approaches for assessing peak V˙O2, diagnosing HF subtype, and reporting potential confounders (ie, medications, comorbidities) that needs to be addressed in future studies. However, despite the inherent variability in comparing exercise tests across independent research laboratories, our meta-analysis provides the most robust analysis to date regarding the HF phenotype–specific differences in peak V˙O2. Finally, despite the limited number of studies measuring peak exercise CO (each using different techniques with inherent limitations58,59), our analysis includes the largest sample size of HFrEF and HFpEF patients (n = 814 and n = 934, respectively) reported to date for these parameters.ConclusionsOur findings suggest that compared to patents with HFpEF, patients with HFrEF have greater impairment in peak V˙O2 that may contribute to increased functional limitations and disability. In the subset of studies investigating the determinants of reduced peak V˙O2 (encompassing 1,748 patients), we also demonstrated that decreased peak V˙O2 in HFrEF patients is primarily due to central factors, whereas HFpEF patients are more peripherally limited, with more impaired cardiac function playing a role in the former, and reduced skeletal muscle quality and metabolism likely playing a more significant role in the latter. Although at the individual level, patients may experience multiple limitations along the O2 cascade, the above-mentioned salient phenotype-specific trends are evident. This highlights that instead of a one-size-fits-all approach, interventions such as exercise training and rehabilitation should be tailored to the specific HF phenotype: with a greater focus on improving cardiac function in patients with HFrEF and improving microvascular and skeletal muscle quality in patients with HFpEF. Understanding that addressing limitations along the entire O2 cascade will result in the greatest improvement in peak V˙O2,33,60 this targeted approach may offer the greatest benefit in alleviating the pronounced exercise intolerance characteristic of each HF phenotype."}

IntroductionChronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) ranks among the foremost contributors to global illness and death, with its impact steadily rising due to the aging global population and continued exposure to harmful factors like cigarette smoke and environmental pollutants [1]. COPD is a progressive respiratory condition marked by chronic symptoms and reduced airflow, primarily resulting from structural changes and damage within the airways and alveoli. Over time, this deterioration significantly impairs lung function and contributes to worsening clinical outcomes. The World Health Organization estimates that over 200 million people are affected by COPD globally, with the disease anticipated to become the third leading cause of death by 2030 [2]. This rising trajectory underscores the critical and growing burden of COPD globally, highlighting the urgent necessity for more effective strategies not only in early disease prevention but also in the comprehensive and long-term management of acute exacerbations and disease progression.The global prevalence of COPD has been increasing, with estimates suggesting that the number of cases among individuals aged 25 years and older will rise by 23% from 2020 to 2050, approaching 600 million cases globally by 2050 [3]. This upward trend is particularly pronounced in low- and middle-income countries, where risk factors such as tobacco smoking, air pollution, and occupational exposures are more prevalent. A key feature of COPD progression is the occurrence of acute exacerbations (AECOPDs), episodes characterized by a sudden worsening of respiratory symptoms that often necessitate urgent medical intervention, hospitalization, and sometimes intensive care support [4]. These exacerbations significantly contribute to the overall disease burden, leading to increased healthcare utilization, reduced quality of life, and higher mortality rates. A study assessing the national inpatient burden of AECOPDs in the United States found that these events are a leading cause of hospitalizations and are associated with substantial healthcare costs [5]. Moreover, frequent exacerbations accelerate the decline in lung function and are linked to increased mortality.The management of AECOPDs remains a critical aspect of COPD care. Exacerbations of COPD, particularly acute episodes, are triggered by a range of factors, including respiratory infections (both viral and bacterial), air pollution, and non-compliance with prescribed medications. These episodes are not only frequent but also clinically heterogeneous, varying in severity, duration, and underlying pathophysiology. Importantly, the frequency of exacerbations correlates strongly with long-term outcomes, including accelerated decline in lung function, worsening dyspnea, and increased risk of death [3]. Recurrent exacerbations may also lead to irreversible changes in the airways due to persistent inflammation and remodeling, underscoring the need for early identification and intervention. Patients who experience two or more exacerbations per year or one hospitalization for AECOPDs are categorized as “frequent exacerbators”, a phenotype associated with poorer prognoses [6].Despite the availability of standard treatment options, which typically include short-acting and long-acting bronchodilators (such as beta-agonists and antimuscarinics), systemic and inhaled corticosteroids, antibiotics (in cases with suspected infection), and supplemental oxygen therapy, a substantial proportion of patients continue to experience significant symptom burden and recurrent exacerbations [4]. In this context, there is increasing interest in identifying and evaluating adjunctive therapies that may offer additional benefits beyond the current standard of care. Emerging evidence also indicates a possible role of electrolyte imbalances—particularly hypomagnesemia—in the pathogenesis and management of AECOPDs. Magnesium plays a crucial role in bronchodilation, mucociliary clearance, and modulation of inflammation. Low serum magnesium levels have been associated with increased bronchial hyperreactivity, muscle fatigue, and poor response to β2-agonists [7]. These findings provide a biological rationale for the use of intravenous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) as adjunctive therapy in AECOPD management.This systematic review and meta-analysis seeks to comprehensively assess the latest findings from both randomized controlled trials and observational studies regarding the effectiveness and safety of intravenous magnesium sulfate when used as an adjunct treatment for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Through this review, we aim to offer a comprehensive synthesis of evidence that may contribute to the optimization of AECOPD management strategies. Ultimately, our goal is to provide clinicians and healthcare policymakers with robust, evidence-based insights that can support more informed decision-making and improve the clinical outcomes and quality of life for patients experiencing acute COPD exacerbations.2. MethodsThis meta-analysis adhered to the guidelines set forth by Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), a widely recognized standard for promoting transparency, consistency, and methodological integrity in systematic reviews and meta-analyses [8]. The PRISMA framework provided a structured approach to the identification, screening, eligibility assessment, and inclusion of relevant studies, thereby enhancing the reproducibility and reliability of our findings. To further uphold transparency and reduce the risk of reporting bias, the study protocol was prospectively registered with PROSPERO under the registration ID CRD420251059442. This registration details the review objectives, inclusion criteria, data synthesis methods, and planned subgroup analyses, ensuring a predefined and accountable research methodology. As this study was entirely based on a secondary analysis of data from previously published randomized controlled trials and observational studies, no new data were collected from human participants by the authors. Consequently, formal ethical approval was not required, as the research did not involve any direct interaction with patients or access to personally identifiable information. This meta-analysis adheres to the ethical standards for research using publicly available data and complies with all relevant regulations regarding data usage and reporting.2.1. Data Sources and SearchesAn extensive literature review was performed to identify studies assessing the effectiveness and safety of intravenous MgSO4 in treating AECOPDs. The search strategy was implemented across several major electronic databases, including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, and Embase, covering all records from database inception up to April 2025. In addition to database searches, ongoing and registered clinical trials were also screened through clinical trial registries to ensure the inclusion of unpublished or ongoing studies that met the eligibility criteria. To develop a robust and sensitive search strategy, a combination of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and free-text keywords was employed. The terms used included but were not limited to the following: “Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease”, “COPD”, “acute exacerbation of COPD”, “AECOPD”, “magnesium sulfate”, “MgSO4”, “randomized controlled trial”, and “RCT”. Boolean operators such as AND and OR were applied to refine the search and combine related terms logically. Moreover, the search strategy was supplemented by manually reviewing the reference lists of all relevant articles and previously published systematic reviews or meta-analyses to identify any additional eligible studies that may not have been captured through database searches alone. The complete search strategy, including all keywords, Boolean operators, and filters applied, is detailed in Table 1. No language restrictions were imposed during the search process to ensure the inclusivity of all potentially relevant data.2.2. Eligibility CriteriaEligibility for inclusion in this systematic review and meta-analysis was determined using a clearly defined set of inclusion and exclusion criteria, established a priori to uphold methodological integrity and ensure alignment with the study’s objectives. To qualify for inclusion, studies were required to meet the following criteria: (i) Study design: randomized controlled trials or observational studies were included. (ii) Population: Eligible studies enrolled adult patients (aged 18 years or older) presenting with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, regardless of sex or geographic location. (iii) Intervention and comparator: The intervention of interest was intravenous magnesium sulfate administered in conjunction with standard bronchodilator therapy. Comparator groups received standard therapy alone without the addition of MgSO4. (iv) Outcomes: Studies were included if they reported at least one relevant clinical outcome, such as peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), hospital admission rates from the emergency department, length of hospital stay, or adverse events. Exclusion criteria were applied to ensure the internal validity of the findings. Studies were excluded if they met any of the following conditions: (1) quasi-randomized trials, case series, or case reports, which lack the methodological robustness required for meta-analytic synthesis; (2) preclinical studies, including those conducted in animal models, as the objective of this meta-analysis was to assess clinical outcomes in human subjects. This stringent selection process ensured the inclusion of high-quality evidence to evaluate the role of IV magnesium sulfate as adjunctive therapy in the management of AECOPD. Two reviewers independently assessed each study for eligibility, and any disagreements were addressed through consultation with a third reviewer.2.3. Selection ProcessWe utilized Rayyan, a web-based systematic review tool, to manage and streamline the screening process of the studies identified through our comprehensive database search. Initially, all retrieved citations were imported into Rayyan, which facilitated the automated detection and removal of duplicate records. Following this deduplication process, the remaining studies underwent an initial screening based on their titles and abstracts. This step was performed independently by two authors, each blinded to the other’s decisions, to reduce the risk of bias and ensure a consistent application of the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Subsequently, studies that appeared to meet the eligibility criteria or those that lacked sufficient information for exclusion during the abstract screening phase were subjected to a more detailed full-text review. During this phase, the authors assessed the studies for relevance, methodological quality, and compliance with the predefined eligibility criteria. In instances where discrepancies or disagreements arose regarding the inclusion or exclusion of specific studies, a third author served as an adjudicator. This structured, multi-reviewer approach ensured a transparent and methodologically robust study selection process.2.4. Data ExtractionData extraction was performed systematically and independently by two reviewers using a standardized, pre-piloted Excel spreadsheet to ensure consistency and accuracy. Key characteristics extracted from each included study comprised the first author’s name, year of publication, study design, country of origin, setting, and sample size. Additional variables included participant demographics such as mean or median age, gender distribution, baseline characteristics, and the specific dosing regimen of intravenous MgSO4, including total dosage, rate of infusion, and duration of administration. Details regarding the comparator or standard treatment arm were also documented. The primary outcomes of interest were peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), and the proportion of participants requiring hospital admission from the emergency department. Secondary outcomes included adverse events and length of hospital stay. Disagreements between the two primary reviewers during the data extraction phase were resolved through adjudication by a third reviewer, ensuring consensus and preserving the objectivity of the selection process.2.5. Risk of Bias AssessmentA thorough quality appraisal was carried out for all included studies to ensure methodological soundness and reduce the likelihood of bias. For randomized controlled trials (RCTs), the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool version 2.0 (RoB 2.0) was utilized. In the case of non-randomized cohort studies, the Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool was employed. Risk of bias results were visually represented using RoBvis tool for clarity. Disagreements between the two primary reviewers during the bias assessment were resolved through adjudication by a third reviewer, ensuring consensus and preserving the objectivity of the selection process.2.6. Data AnalysisData synthesis and analysis were conducted using RevMan (The Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen, Denmark). A random-effects model was applied to account for potential variability both within and between the included studies, acknowledging that clinical and methodological diversity may influence the observed effects. To evaluate statistical heterogeneity across the included trials, the I2 statistic was employed. This metric quantifies the proportion of variability in effect estimates that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance. An I2 value exceeding 50% was interpreted as indicative of substantial heterogeneity. When notable heterogeneity was observed, its potential sources were explored through sensitivity analyses. Given the small number of included studies—fewer than ten—it was not statistically appropriate to perform formal assessments of publication bias, such as funnel plots or Egger’s regression test. According to established methodological standards, these tools are unreliable with limited data and may produce misleading results under such conditions. To further investigate the robustness of the findings and identify any study that may disproportionately influence the overall results, a leave-one-out sensitivity analysis was conducted. This approach involves iteratively removing one study at a time and recalculating the pooled estimates, thereby allowing for the identification of outlier studies contributing to heterogeneity or skewing the overall effect size.3. Results3.1. Study SelectionThe initial comprehensive literature search across electronic databases yielded a total of 169 potentially relevant articles. Following the removal of 28 duplicate records, 141 unique studies were identified and screened based on their titles and abstracts. During this initial screening phase, 129 records were excluded for not meeting the predefined eligibility criteria—such as having the wrong study design or target populations, interventions not involving intravenous magnesium sulfate, or outcomes not pertinent to acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Consequently, 12 articles were retained for full-text evaluation to determine their suitability for inclusion in the systematic review and meta-analysis. After a thorough assessment of study design, population characteristics, interventions, and reported outcomes, three studies were excluded due to wrong comparator (2) or ineligible study design (1). Ultimately, nine studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis, forming the basis for the quantitative and qualitative synthesis of findings (Figure 1).3.2. Study CharacteristicsThe included studies were RCTs and observational studies investigating the use of intravenous MgSO4 in emergency [9,10,11,12,13,14,15] and inpatient settings [16,17]. Six studies were RCTs conducted in emergency departments involving patients with AECOPD. Two observational studies, conducted in inpatient settings, assessed the effects of MgSO4 in a non-randomized fashion. Dosing of MgSO4 ranged from 1.2 g to 2.5 g, typically diluted in 100 mL of normal saline and administered over 15–30 min. One study included aerosolized MgSO4 (150 mg) in addition to an IV bolus [11]. The mean age of participants ranged from 58.3 to 74.3 years. Detailed study characteristics are presented in Table 2. Most of the trials were judged to have a low risk of bias across all domains. Two trials [10,11] had some concerns due to issues in randomization (Figure S1) and deviations from intended interventions. Among the observational studies, only Aishwarya 2022 [16] had a moderate overall risk of bias due to moderate concerns in confounding and selection of participants (Figure S2).3.3. Primary Outcomes3.3.1. Peak Expiratory Flow at 45 minFour studies reported on peak expiratory flow (PEF) at 45 min. The pooled analysis demonstrated that patients who received adjunct IV MgSO4 had a greater PEF at 45 min compared to placebo (MD = 18.50, 95% CI = 6.36 to 30.65; p = 0.03, I2 = 0%) (Figure 2A).3.3.2. Proportion of People with Hospital Admissions from Emergency RoomThree studies reported about the proportion of people with hospital admissions from the emergency room. Pooled analysis showed that patients receiving IV MgSO4 had significantly lower odds of hospital admission compared to those receiving placebo (OR = 0.45, 95% CI = 0.23 to 0.88; p = 0.02, I2 = 0%) (Figure 2B).3.4. Secondary Outcomes3.4.1. Length of Hospital StayLength of hospital stay was reported by three studies. The pooled analysis showed no statistically significant difference between the two groups (MD = −0.83, 95% CI = −2.99 to 1.33; p = 0.45, I2 = 87%) (Figure 3A). By excluding the study by Nouira et al., sensitivity analysis reduced the I2 to 0% and made the finding significant (Figure S3).3.4.2. Adverse EventsFour studies reported the incidence of adverse events, which included nausea, weakness, dizziness, increased secretions, skin reactions, headache, cardiovascular effects, and tremors. The pooled analysis demonstrated no significant difference between the two groups (OR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.20 to 3.13; p = 0.73, I2 = 25%) (Figure 3B).4. DiscussionIn this meta-analysis, the addition of intravenous MgSO4 to standard bronchodilator therapy was associated with a reduction in inpatient admissions from the emergency department and a notable improvement in peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) at 45 min compared to standard treatment. These findings reinforce the potential role of MgSO4 as an adjunctive treatment in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, highlighting both efficacy and a favorable safety profile. Notably, the length of hospital stay and incidence of adverse events were comparable between groups, suggesting that the addition of MgSO4 does not compromise patient safety.Emerging evidence suggests a potential link between hypomagnesemia and increased susceptibility to AECOPD, highlighting the role of magnesium in respiratory physiology and its therapeutic implications [7]. Magnesium is a vital intracellular cation involved in numerous physiological processes, including enzymatic reactions, neuromuscular conduction, and regulation of smooth muscle tone [18]. These properties underscore its potential utility in managing bronchospastic conditions, such as asthma and COPD.Magnesium sulfate has been extensively studied as an adjunctive treatment in AECOPD and severe asthma. Its efficacy is supported by prior clinical trials demonstrating that MgSO4 enhances bronchodilation, reduces hospitalization rates, and improves lung function when combined with standard therapy [19,20]. The mechanism of action of magnesium sulfate involves antagonizing calcium-mediated smooth muscle contraction, leading to bronchial smooth muscle relaxation [19,21]. Furthermore, MgSO4 may enhance β2-adrenergic receptor affinity, enhancing the effectiveness and prolonging their duration of action [22]. This is reflected in our findings as the patients who received IV MgSO4 had a higher PEFR as compared to those who received standard care only.Furthermore, our results showed that IV MgSO4 therapy also led to a statistically significant reduction in inpatient admission rates. This reduction has important implications for healthcare systems, particularly in low-resource settings or during peak periods when emergency departments and inpatient units are under strain [23]. A treatment that reduces the need for inpatient care while maintaining or improving patient outcomes is of substantial value, both in terms of resource allocation and patient quality of care. The simplicity of administration and low cost of MgSO4 further enhance its feasibility as an adjunct therapy in emergency settings. Interventions like MgSO4 that optimize acute care outcomes have the potential to significantly reduce the strain on healthcare systems, particularly when they are cost-effective and easily implementable in emergency settings [24]. Current international guidelines, including GOLD [25] and NICE guidelines [26], do not recommend intravenous magnesium sulfate as a routine adjunctive therapy for acute exacerbations of AECOPD. However, in severe or refractory cases, IV MgSO4 (typically 1.2–2 g infused over 20–30 min) may be cautiously considered due to its bronchodilatory effects, although supporting evidence remains limited.The safety profile was reassuring as common adverse effects like nausea, weakness, dizziness, increased secretions, skin reactions, headache, cardiovascular effects, and tremors were comparable between both groups. Notably, the therapeutic window for magnesium is relatively wide, and side effects typically arise only with excessive dosing or in patients with compromised renal function. Sensitivity analysis further elucidated the impact of individual studies on the overall findings. Specifically, excluding the study by Nouira et al. reduced heterogeneity to zero and revealed a statistically significant reduction in hospital stay for patients receiving intravenous MgSO4. This suggests that variations in study design, particularly dosing strategies and patient populations, may have influenced the pooled results. Nouira et al.’s study used a different dosing regimen compared to other included studies, which might explain its outlier effect [11]. Understanding such nuances is crucial when interpreting meta-analytic data, as methodological heterogeneity can obscure true treatment effects.Lastly, the current review has certain limitations. The analysis was based on study-level data rather than individual patient data (IPD), which limits our ability to conduct more detailed subgroup analyses. For instance, we could not assess whether the efficacy of magnesium sulfate varies according to baseline COPD severity, presence of comorbid conditions such as cardiovascular disease or diabetes, or prior history of exacerbations. Such analyses are essential for personalizing treatment and identifying patient groups most likely to benefit from adjunctive magnesium therapy. Furthermore, the included studies varied in several key aspects, including dosing protocols, duration of therapy, criteria for hospital admission, and definitions of outcomes. Such clinical heterogeneity introduces potential confounding factors that may influence the observed treatment effects. While the use of a random-effects model helps account for between-study variability, it does not eliminate the underlying differences in study design. Standardization of future trials in terms of dosing regimens, outcome measures, and follow-up periods would enhance the comparability of results and strengthen the evidence base. The studies varied in their treatment protocols and dosing strategies, which may have influenced the observed outcomes. A formal assessment of publication bias was not possible due to the inclusion of fewer than 10 studies.Lastly, the long-term impact of adjunctive magnesium therapy on COPD outcomes warrants investigation. While acute improvements in lung function and hospitalization rates are important, understanding whether these translate into better long-term disease control, fewer subsequent exacerbations, and improved quality of life is critical. Incorporating patient-reported outcomes and cost-effectiveness analyses into future trials would also provide a more comprehensive assessment of magnesium’s role in COPD management.5. ConclusionsIn patients with acute exacerbation of COPD, adjunctive intravenous magnesium sulfate was associated with a statistically significant improvement in peak expiratory flow at 45 min and a significant reduction in hospital admission rates from the emergency department, with a favorable safety profile. These findings suggest that intravenous MgSO4 may serve as an effective adjunct therapy in AECOPD, particularly in settings where rapid symptom resolution and hospital avoidance are critical. However, to establish the definitive clinical benefits of adjunct IV MgSO4 in COPD management, well-designed, large-scale, multicenter randomized controlled trials are warranted. These studies should aim to standardize treatment protocols, explore optimal dosing strategies, and assess long-term outcomes, including quality of life and cost-effectiveness."}

While several mortality risk factors have been described, a comprehensive synthesis is lacking. We conducted a meta-analysis of studies investigating mortality risk factors in Pertussis infections and validated those factors in a large cohort.MethodsObservational studies published in English were systematically searched in PubMed, EMBASE, and LiSSa databases from 01/2000 to 06/2024. The search yielded 816 unique citations. The primary outcome was mortality before discharge from the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU). Two independent reviewers assessed the risk of bias and extracted data. A REML-random effect model was used to calculate pooled prevalence and conduct the analysis. The identified risk factors were subsequently evaluated in a monocentric cohort of patients admitted to a tertiary hospital’s PICU for severe pertussis between January 1996 and December 2020. Data analysis was conducted between June and August 2024.ResultsSeventeen studies, including 2,725 patients, met the inclusion criteria. The pooled prevalence of mechanical ventilation, continuous renal replacement therapy, and Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation support were 55% (95% CI: 40–70; I2 = 98), 15% (95% CI: 3–27; I2 = 95), and 8% (95% CI: 3–12; I2 = 93), respectively. The pooled mortality incidence was 19% (95% CI:12–26; I2 = 96). Identified mortality risk factors included elevated heart rate, presence of pulmonary hypertension, presence of seizures, and elevated white blood cell (WBC) count. Validation in an 83-patient cohort (median age: 45 days, IQR: 30–55) revealed a mortality rate of 12%. Risk factors identified in the meta-analysis were significantly associated with non-survival in the cohort. A mortality prediction score was developed incorporating age < 30 days, heart rate > 200/min, and WBC > 30 G/l, achieving an area under the curve of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.86–0.99).ConclusionThis meta-analysis identified a simple yet effective score to assess the severity of pertussis infection in infants admitted to PICU. Accurate risk stratification may enable timely treatment of critically ill patients, potentially improving outcomes.Trial registration: The study protocol was registered on PROSPERO: CRD42024582057.Graphic abstract\n\nSupplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13054-025-05300-2.", "body": "BackgroundBordetella pertussis, a Gram-negative bacterium, causes whooping cough, a highly contagious respiratory infection [1]. Despite the availability of effective immunization, pertussis continues to circulate, leading to outbreaks and potentially fatal cases among vulnerable populations [2, 3]. Pertussis remains a significant cause of infant mortality, affecting both high-income and low-to-middle-income countries [3–5]. Additionally, several European countries have reported a resurgence of pertussis cases in recent years [6].Numerous studies have identified risk factors associated with mortality in severe pertussis infections, highlighting hyperleukocytosis as a critical marker of disease severity and mortality [7]. Other significant risk factors include younger age at presentation and pulmonary hypertension, observations initially reported in the description of “malignant” pertussis nearly 60 years ago [8–10]. However, a comprehensive synthesis of these risk factors is lacking. Studies vary in their definitions of age-related risk thresholds for leukocyte counts and often involve a limited number of patients. Additionally, outcome measures differ, ranging from hospitalization to mortality. A unified, synthesized mortality predictor for pertussis is needed to identify high-risk patients promptly. Such tools would support decisions regarding early PICU admission and intervention, such as leukoreduction therapy, which has been suggested to improve patient outcomes [11, 12]. A clinical score reflecting mortality risk could aid physicians in determining which patients require escalation of care, including advanced medical support.In this study, we aimed to identify mortality risk factors associated with severe pertussis infections in children through a meta-analysis. Subsequently, we evaluated these risk factors in a single-center cohort to create a bedside mortality prediction model, providing a practical tool for clinical use.MethodsMeta-analysis: search strategiesThe clinical research question addressed was: What are the clinical criteria associated with mortality in critically ill infants with pertussis infection? Pubmed, LiSSa, and EMBASE databases were systematically searched between June and July 2024 for relevant peer-reviewed articles published in English from January 2000 to June 2024, following PRISMA guidelines [13]. A combination of MeSH terms, including “Bordetella pertussis,” “critical care,” and “mortality,” was employed (details provided in Supplementary materials and methods). References of selected publications were also screened to identify additional relevant articles potentially missed in the initial search.Two reviewers (VLC and CC) independently screened titles and abstracts to determine eligibility. The inclusion criteria were studies reporting mortality risk factors for Bordetella pertussis infection in children. Reviews and case reports were excluded if the case series included fewer than five patients. Studies focusing solely on risk factors for severe infection without addressing mortality were also excluded. Mortality risk factors reported in at least two studies were included in the meta-analysis. The study was registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42024582057).Meta-analysis: risk factors selection and statisticsData extraction was conducted independently by two authors (VLC and CC). Baseline data extracted included year of publications, number of patients included, age of the population, and mortality rate. Population severity was assessed by reporting mechanical ventilation, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and blood exchange therapy. Pulmonary hypertension (PAH) presence was also recorded. Duration of mechanical ventilation and PICU stay were also noted when available. Mortality-related factors reported in more than two studies were extracted for consistent reporting. Crude descriptive statistics from reviewed articles were included in the pooled analysis. For studies reporting medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) instead of means and standard deviations (SD), the algorithm published by Wan et al. was used to estimate the mean and SD [14].Statistical analysis was performed using Stata v18 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). The meta-analysis software pack was used to calculate pooled prevalence and perform the analyses using the REML random effect model. Forest plots were generated for data visualization. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistics, with I2 values higher than 50% indicating high heterogeneity.Cohort study: patient populationA single-center retrospective study was conducted in the PICU of the Bicêtre Hospital (Bicêtre Hospital AP-HP, Paris-Saclay University, Le Kremlin-Bicêtre, France) from January 1996 to December 2020. Patients under 90 days of age admitted for a severe pertussis infection were screened, and PICU reports were reviewed. The study was approved by the ethical committee from the French Society of Intensive Care (CE SRLF 23–074). The study has been registered at the “Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés” corresponding to the reference methodology (MR-004). Data processing adhered to European legislation, and families were informed via a welcome booklet about the potential use of clinical data for research and their right to opt-out.Cohort study: data collectionBaseline demographic data at admission were collected from the individual medical records alongside clinical, biochemical, and hematological parameters during the PICU stay. The use of vasopressor drugs, mechanical ventilation, CRRT, ECMO, and exchange transfusion were recorded. Cardiac failure was defined by a low cardiac index (< 2.2 l/min/m2) or the use of dobutamine or adrenaline after echocardiographic evaluation. Pulmonary hypertension was assessed by trained echocardiographists using tricuspid and/or pulmonary regurgitation velocity. The highest leucocyte count (G/L) during the PICU stay was documented.Cohort study: statisticsCategorical variables were expressed as percentages (%), and continuous variables as the medians with IQR. When appropriate, categorical variables were analyzed using a chi-square or Fisher’s exact tests, while continuous variables were analyzed using Wilcoxon tests.The primary outcome was mortality in the PICU. Bivariate analysis was used to test the association between demographic, clinical, laboratory, and management characteristics and mortality. Univariate logistic regression provided odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for mortality predictors.A bedside clinical score for severe pertussis, developed via the meta-analysis, was validated using forward multivariate logistic regression in the cohort. Model fit was assessed with the Hosmer–Lemeshow test (p-value > 0.05 indicating good fit), and the Receiver Operating Curve (ROC) was used to evaluate predictive accuracy. Variables retained for the mortality score were weighted based on their relative β parameters. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses were conducted using STATA v18 software (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).ResultsReview and populationUsing the outlined inclusion and exclusion criteria, 816 articles were identified. After screening, 17 studies were included (Fig. 1), with bias assessment detailed in supplementary Table 1 [5, 11, 15–28]. These studies involved 2,725 patients; their main characteristics are presented in Table 1. Of these, 12 studies focused exclusively on PICU-admitted patients [11, 15–19, 22–27], while five included all patients admitted with pertussis infections [5, 20, 21, 28, 29]. Two studies employed a case–control design [20, 28].Fig. 1Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis flow diagramTable 1Description of included studies in the meta-analysisStudy IDHospCountryNumberAge in daysImmunizationMVCRRTECMOMV durPICU LOSPatients(mean (SD) [range])(%)(%)(%)(%)(mean (SD)(mean (SD)Smith et al.

A Mechanical ventilation pooled prevalence. 16/17 studies reported mechanical ventilation. B Continuous renal replacement therapy (CCRT) pooled prevalence. 5/17 studies reported CRRT. C Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) pooled prevalence and 11/17 studies reported ECMO. D Mortality pooled prevalence, 15/17 reported mortality. CI, confidence intervalReview of mortality risk factorsMortality risk factors were classified into clinical and biological variables. Reporting of these factors varied, with some studies presenting age and WBC as continuous or categorical.Clinical variables associated with mortality included tachycardia (mean difference 18.2 bpm; 95% CI: 7.2–29; p < 0.001; I2 = 81) (5/17 studies), seizures (OR 4.06; 95% CI: 1.7–9.3; p < 0.001; I2 = 48) (9/17 studies) and pulmonary hypertension (OR 43.1; 95% CI: 13.5–137.8; p < 0.001; I2 = 74) (10/17 studies). In contrast, apnea was not associated with mortality (OR 0.97; 95% CI: 0.3–3.5; p = 0.66; I2 = 70) (8/17 studies) (Fig. 3 A–D). Age was not associated with mortality as a continuous variable (mean difference -3.5 days; 95% CI: -11.7–4.5; p = 0.39; I2 = 0) (9/17 studies) (Supplementary Fig. 2 A–D). Dichotomic age cut-offs of 2 months (6/17 studies) and 3 months (5/17 studies) were also not associated with mortality.Fig. 3Forrest plot of included studies reporting clinical risk factors for non-survival.

C Pooled odds ratio of the presence of seizure, favoring non-survival. 9/17 studies included. D Pooled odds ratio of the presence of apnea. 8/17 studies included. CI, confidence intervalFor biological variables, WBC counts were consistently reported. Elevated WBCs at admission (32.5 G/L; 95% CI: 20.7–44.3; p < 0.001; I2 = 72) (8/17 studies) and peak WBC counts (43.4 G/L; 95% CI: 30–56.8; p < 0.001; I2 = 84) (8/17 studies) were strongly associated with mortality (Fig. 4). Similar associations were observed for higher admission lymphocyte levels (7/17 studies), neutrophil counts (4/17 studies), and peak lymphocyte counts (6/17 studies) (Supplementary Fig. 3 A–C). Studies reporting WBCs as categorical variables with thresholds of 30 G/l (5/17 studies) or 50 G/l (5/17 studies) confirmed a strong association with mortality (Supplementary Fig. 3 D and E).Fig. 4Forrest plot of included studies reporting biological risk factors for non-survival.

CI, confidence intervalValidation cohort characteristicsThe validation cohort comprised 83 patients with a median age at admission of 45 days (IQR: 30–55 days). The diagnosis was confirmed with PCR in 73 patients, serology in 2 patients, and clinical criteria in 8 patients. Pulmonary hypertension was diagnosed in 12/83 (14,5%) patients. Mechanical ventilation was required in 27/83 (32,5%) patients, with a median ventilator support duration of 6 days (IQR: 3–11). CRRT was used in 5/83 (5%) patients and ECMO in 4/83 (2/4 surviving). Complete demographic and organ failure data are provided in Supplementary Table 2. Median PICU stay was 8 days (IQR: 4–12), and cohort mortality was 12% (10/83).Factors associated with mortalityVariables identified in the meta-analysis and the cohort were tested in a bivariate analysis (Table 2). Three factors—admission WBC > 30 G/l, age < 30 days, and tachycardia > 200/min—were incorporated into a multivariate model. Optimal cut-off values were selected to maximize the predictive accuracy.Table 2Univariate and multivariate analysis of factors associated with in-PICU survivalVariablesOR (95% CI)p valueMissing dataUnivariate analysisAge (days)0.95 (95% CI 0.9–0.99)0.0480PRISM 2 score1.15 (95% CI 1.04–1.27)0.00713PELOD score1.12 (95% CI 1.01–1.25)0.02213Leucocytes (G/l) on admission1.08 (95% CI 1.04–1.1) < 0.0014Peak leucocytes (G/l)1.06 (95% CI 1.03–1.1) < 0.0015Heart rate (/min) on admission1.06 (95% CI 1.01–1.1)0.0042Pulmonary hypertension210 (95% CI 19.6–2240.2) < 0.0010Mechanical ventilationNA predict perfectlyNA0CRRT48 (95% CI 4,6–500,4)0.0010Blood exchange31.7 (95% CI 6,2–161,8) < 0.0010Multivariate modelAdmission WBC > 30 G/l10.8 (95% CI 1.5–77.9)0.018Age < 30 days23 (95% CI 2.2–236.7)0.008Heart rate > 200/min44.8 (95% CI 2.1–964.6)0.015Forward multivariate model Hosmer–Lemeshow test p-value = 0.56, R2 0.44NA, none applicable; OR, odds ratio (95% confidence intervals); PRISM, paediatric risk of mortality score; PELOD, paediatric logistic organ dysfunction; CRRT, Continuous renal replacement therapy; WBC, white blood cellsThe resulting model demonstrated a substantial predictive value (AUC 0.92; 95% CI: 0.85–0.99) with an R2 of 0.44 (Table 2).

Through meta-analysis and cohort validation, we identified three critical mortality risk factors: tachycardia > 200 /min, young age (< 30 days), and leucocytes > 30 G/l. These factors delineate cases with very high mortality risk.The recent resurgence of pertussis infection in Europe underscores the importance of ongoing prevention efforts and early identification of severe infections [6, 30–32]. Despite advancements in organ support within PICUs and robust public vaccination strategies, PICU admission and mortality rates have remained stable over the past two decades [29, 33, 34]. While not fully understood, this stability highlights the need for further progress in managing pertussis infections, as emphasized by the PERISCOPE consortium [10]. Enhancing maternal immunization, vaccinating caregivers and close family members, and increasing public awareness are pivotal strategies to reduce pertussis-related mortality [2, 29, 35–37]. Early testing and diagnosis of pertussis, especially in high-risk populations during epidemic periods, are crucial. Prompt detection facilitates timely treatment initiation and referral to PICU when necessary, potentially improving outcomes [1, 11, 38].This meta-analysis highlighted the severity of pertussis infection in infants admitted to the PICU, where many patients require organ support [39–41]. While less frequently employed, ECMO remains a topic of debate due to its low survival rates compared to other conditions, such as meconium aspiration syndrome or respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia [42]. However, ECMO support may still have a role in selected cases, particularly when combined with leukoreduction therapy, as suggested by Domenico et al. [43].Besides antibiotics treatment and organ failure support, leukoreduction therapies, including leukapheresis or whole blood exchange, remain the cornerstone for managing severe pertussis infections associated with hyperleukocytosis [44]. Hyperleukocytosis has been repeatedly linked to organ failure and mortality, making it a critical therapeutic target [12, 45, 46]. Manual blood exchange, readily available in most centers, was the most reported leukoreductive therapy, with a pooled prevalence in the meta-analysis of 12%. Early leukoreduction has been associated with improved outcomes, as suggested by Rowlands et al. and corroborated by Coquaz-Garoudet et al. [11, 12].Early recognition of severe pertussis infection is vital to enable timely PICU referral, organ support initiation, and leukoreduction, all of which can improve patient outcomes [11, 12]. Herein, we propose a simple bedside mortality risk score incorporating WBC > 30 G/L, age < 30 days, and tachycardia > 200/min. These variables reflect critical aspects of pertussis pathophysiology. Elevated WBC may contribute to hyperviscosity and microvascular occlusion or significantly increase bacterial toxin load [1, 7, 9].Tachycardia, referred to as “tachycardia sine materia”, is indicative of systemic inflammation and potential cardio-pulmonary failure and is a hallmark of severe pertussis infection [8]. Pulmonary hypertension, a well-documented feature of severe pertussis, may result from hyperleukocytosis as well as a direct effect of pertussis toxin on the endothelium but is less practical to access in resource-limited settings, making heart rate a more accessible proxy [1, 7]. Finally, an age of less than 30 days, although not identified in the meta-analysis, was a decisive risk factor in our cohort and other studies [34, 40, 47–49]. It likely reflects the vulnerability of unvaccinated infants with potentially immature immune systems that may lead to a higher Bordetella inoculum, as suggested by Nakamura et al. [2, 50, 51].Our study has several limitations. Despite a comprehensive literature review, some relevant studies may have been missed. Restricting the review to English-language articles may have introduced a bias, though evidence suggests this limitation has minimal impact on systematic review conclusions [52]. Data transformation from original articles and the heterogeneity in the study settings, spanning 24 years and multiple countries, may affect the generalizability of pooled findings. Additionally, our cohort study was monocentric and retrospective, warranting caution in extrapolating results to broader populations. Nonetheless, the robust methodological approach and alignment with clinical understanding of severe pertussis infection strengthen the validity of our findings.ConclusionThis meta-analysis and cohort study highlight the severity of severe pertussis infection in infants and identify key risk factors for mortality. We propose a simple bedside-based mortality risk score based on WBC > 30 G/L, age < 30 days, and tachycardia > 200/min. While promising, this score requires further external validation and real-world testing.Supplementary Information\nSupplementary file 1."}
