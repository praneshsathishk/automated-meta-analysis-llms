Antiplatelet drugs are widely used for the secondary prevention of stroke because antiplatelet therapy has been proven to have larger benefits than risk. [ 1 – 4 ] However, the effects of antiplatelet in primary prevention for cardiovascular events and mortality after stroke have been controversial. [ 5 – 7 ] Results have been varied according to the subjects who were enrolled in the studies, and the recommendation of aspirin was different considering the risk factors for cerebrovascular disease and demographic factors such as sex and age. [ 8 , 9 ]
The effects of prior antiplatelet therapy on functional outcomes and other complications have been studied. [ 10 – 13 ] Some previous researches concluded that antiplatelet therapy was not associated with mortality after ischemic stroke regardless of the timing of morality and all-cause mortality. [ 10 , 11 ] A recent study about the association with stroke severity and prior antithrombotic therapy showed that antiplatelet t"

[ 10 , 11 ] A recent study about the association with stroke severity and prior antithrombotic therapy showed that antiplatelet therapy could decrease initial stroke severity [ 12 ] and infarction volume. [ 14 ]
The primary prevention of aspirin can be expected to be effective in the high-risk groups because the secondary prevention of aspirin has proven its effectiveness. [ 1 – 4 ] However, in the recent primary prevention studies targeting the high-risk groups, the incidence of cardiovascular events was much lower than expected. [ 15 – 19 ] On the other hand, if national-wide retrospective data is used, large-scale data can be used, but it may be vulnerable to immortal or selection biases. [ 20 ] In this study, to avoid these biases, we pooled patients with first-ever hemorrhagic/ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction (MI) with nation-wide data and reconsidered the use of aspirin for the primary prevention by s"

In hemorrhagic stroke, there was no difference when all neurologic disabilities were included (HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.97–1.30; P = .12). However, when only severe neurologic disabilities were assessed, more disabilities were registered in the aspirin group (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.02–1.42; P = .02). When"

However, when only severe neurologic disabilities were assessed, more disabilities were registered in the aspirin group (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.02–1.42; P = .02). When cerebral infarction and cerebral hemorrhage were pooled, the registration of neurologic disability did not show any difference when including all disabilities (HR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.92–1.07; P = .92) and severe neurologic disabilities (HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.95–1.15; P = .40).

The risk of 90-day mortality after hemorrhagic stroke was highly affected by age: if compared with the risks of the age of fewer than 60 years, 60s (HR 2.21, 95% CI 1.50–3.25; P < .001), 70s (HR 3.63, 95% CI 2.48–5.30; P < .001), those in their 80s (HR 6.69, 95% CI 4.54–9.65; P < .001), and those in their 90s or older (11.28, 95% CI 6.46–19.70; P < .001) significantly increased the risk of the 90-day death (Fig. 2 ). The old age was also a strong risk factor for 90-day mortality after ischemic stroke and MI (data not shown).

4. Discussion
We examined 8770 patients with prior aspirin therapy and matched comparison subjects from a nation-wide cohort database of 3,080,639 Korean populations who were older than 55. By pooling hemorrhagic/ischemic stroke and MI, we could estimate the overall effects of aspirin at the population level. Our results demonstrate that prior aspirin therapy significantly increased severe neurologic disability in hemorrhagic stroke and 90-day and long-term mortality rates in all 3 cardiovascular events. For the 90-day mortality of hemorrhagic stroke, which can be regarded as a direct consequence of hemorrhagic stroke, the old age is the most critical factor.

In this retrospective large-scale cohort study using NHIS data, aspirin therapy had no benefit in the prognosis of cardiovascular events. Antiplatelet drugs showed a beneficial effect on secondary prevention for cardiovascular events but had complications, including bleeding risk. [ 1 – 4 ] Thus, antiplatelets should be prescribed considering the risk and benefit for each individual. A meta-analysis by Antithrombotic Trialists’ Collaboration presented that the primary prevention effect of aspirin on ischemic stroke was insignificant. [ 1 ] Another meta-analysis of randomized trials in 2019 showed that aspirin did not significantly reduce ischemic stroke occurrence in patients without previous cardiovascular event, and aspirin also did not show any beneficial effect on the primary prevention of stroke in patients with diabetes mellitus on previous studies. [ 7 , 10 , "
PMC10289750,PMC10289750_chunk_20,"ients without previous cardiovascular event, and aspirin also did not show any beneficial effect on the primary prevention of stroke in patients with diabetes mellitus on previous studies. [ 7 , 10 , 22 , 23 ] On the other hand, there has been a report of the beneficial primary prevention effect for stroke in women. [ 9 ] Previous studies of the primary prevention effect for ischemic stroke showed conflicting results, and the effects might differ according to subjects’ characteristics such as sex and comorbidities and various study design. It has also been suggested that there might be an ethnic difference in the effect of antiplatelet agents, considering habitual status, including eating, and higher intracerebral bleeding risk in Asian populations. Recently conducted studies in Japan showed no beneficial effect of aspirin for the primary prevention of stroke and death in elderly patients with atherosclerotic risk factors. [ 5 , 24 ]

Our study has several limitations. We used NHIS cohort data with a retrospective study design. Although we matched 2 groups regarding the medical status and socioeconomic factors, there might be more confounding factors. For example, we do not divide stroke type in our analysis, and there might be a difference in the primary prevention effect according to stroke subtype. [ 25 ] In addition, based on our results, although the aspirin group showed an increased risk for mortality, initial stroke severity could be higher compared with the control group considering the mortality rate.
In conclusion, prior aspirin use was no benefit for neurologic disability and short/long-term mortality after cardiovascular events. In 90-day mortality after cardiovascular events, the old age is a critical factor. So far, no benefit has been demonstrated for aspi"

So far, no benefit has been demonstrated for aspirin over placebo in the elderly over 70 years of age, and aspirin increased the risk of bleeding, according to recent randomized clinical trials. [ 15 – 17 ] Since bleeding is much fatal in the elderly, aspirin prescription for primary prevention should be more careful in the elderly.

The trend toward universal health coverage in Mongolia seems to have stagnated. Service coverage related to cardiovascular health (CVH) risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and smoking is also below the global average; there was no improvement between 2000 and 2019 [ 1 ]. Of the 4 noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) most common among Mongolian adults aged 30-70 years, cardiovascular disease (CVD) accounted for the largest proportion (17.3%) of deaths [ 2 ]. In a cross-sectional study that examined a nationally representative sample of 70,380 people aged 35-75 years in Inner Mongolia, 25% of the study participants were at high-risk for CVD, with more than 10% at risk of developing CVD after 10 years [ 3 ]. However, Mongolian adults’ low rates of hypertension control treatment, along with high rates of smoking, sodium intake, and obesity, indicate that CVH is not adequately managed in Mongolian adults [ 4 - 7 ].

There is substantial evidence for the effectiveness of individual lifestyle changes to reduce CVH risk [ 8 - 10 ]; nevertheless, it is necessary to examine situations such as the structural social determinants of health (SDH) in Mongolia, where essential service coverage is not guaranteed. SDH, such as education and health insurance coverage, can be more important than lifestyle choices in influencing population health and health equity because of their connection to CVD pathogenesis. Chronic psychosocial stress can be induced among individuals who are susceptible to SDH, and this stress can lead to chronic inflammation by activating the sympathetic nervous system linked to altered stress hormone. For example, glucocorticoid receptor resistance due to chronic activation of the sympathetic nervous system blunts the anti-inflammatory response; it co"

For example, glucocorticoid receptor resistance due to chronic activation of the sympathetic nervous system blunts the anti-inflammatory response; it could contribute to enabling CVD development and progression. [ 11 ]. Further, the Denmark study showed that a low education level was independently associated with a higher risk of CVD among 1.6 million Danish employees [ 12 ]. In Colombia, people with lower education levels have a higher risk of dying prematurely from CVD, and these education inequalities affect female individuals more than male individuals [ 13 ]. A prospective cohort study that examined 390,881 Chinese adults aged 18-64 years with a mean follow-up of 10.4 years revealed that having private health insurance coverage was associated with a 21% lower risk of CVD mortality compared to being uninsured [ 14 ].
However, there are insufficient studies showing the influence of SDH on CVH among Mongolian adults. Thus, the identific"

However, there are insufficient studies showing the influence of SDH on CVH among Mongolian adults. Thus, the identification of SDH should be the foundation for developing strategies that promote CVH and reduce long-term health inequality [ 15 ]. Research on this topic can provide critical information that can be used for evidence-based planning and decision-making based on priorities regarding CVH equity. As prevalence of CVD risk differed according to sex and age among Mongolian adults [ 3 , 4 ], the population group characteristics should be considered when confirming the influence of SDH on CVH. Thus, this study aimed to explore the sex and age differences in the independent associations between SDH (educational level and health insurance) and CVH among Mongolian adults.

Methods
Data were obtained from the 2019 Mongolia STEPwise approach to noncommunicable disease risk-factor surveillance (STEPS). The World Health Organization (WHO) initiated STEPS in various countries, recognizing a need for standardized worldwide risk-factor data on NCD risk factors for surveillance systems [ 16 , 17 ]. STEPS was conducted in Mongolia to assess the impact and effect of the integrated national program on “NCD Prevention and Control” [ 5 ]. STEPS is a repeated household survey that is population based and cross-sectional. It uses multistage cluster sampling to extract and investigate a nationally representative sample [ 18 ]. The fourth Mongolia STEPS survey was carried out using 377 sampling clusters selected from 21 provinces and 9 districts of Ulaanbaatar in 2019 [ 5 ]. Of the 6654 people who participated in the 2019 Mongolia STEPS, participants aged younger than 18 years (n=173, 2.6%) and those who "

Of the 6654 people who participated in the 2019 Mongolia STEPS, participants aged younger than 18 years (n=173, 2.6%) and those who had missing data on key variables (n=790, 11.9%) were excluded and 5691 (85.5%) participants were finally included in this secondary data analysis.
All participants provided written informed consent prior to participating in the 2019 Mongolia STEPS. This study was granted an exemption by the institutional review board (4-2021-1341) of Severance Hospital at Yonsei University College of Medicine, Republic of Korea, which allows secondary analyses without additional consent.
Information about education level, possessing health insurance, and average household earnings in the past year were assessed through face-to-face interviews [ 16 ].

Current health insurance was assessed using the question “Do you currently have any kind of health insurance or health care coverage?” [ 16 ]. The average monthly household income was calculated by dividing the average household income in the previous year by 12. Equivalized household income was defined as the average monthly household income divided by the square root of the number of household members [ 19 ]. The study participants were divided into 4 groups according to the quartiles of equivalized household income.
We used the modified Life’s Simple 7 by the American Heart Association to measure CVH.

Data and Study Participants
Data were obtained from the 2019 Mongolia STEPwise approach to noncommunicable disease risk-factor surveillance (STEPS). The World Health Organization (WHO) initiated STEPS in various countries, recognizing a need for standardized worldwide risk-factor data on NCD risk factors for surveillance systems [ 16 , 17 ]. STEPS was conducted in Mongolia to assess the impact and effect of the integrated national program on “NCD Prevention and Control” [ 5 ].

SDH Factor
Information about education level, possessing health insurance, and average household earnings in the past year were assessed through face-to-face interviews [ 16 ]. Educational attainment was categorized into 2 groups: <12 years of education and ≥12 years of education (reference group). Current health insurance was assessed using the question “Do you currently have any kind of health insurance or health care coverage?” [ 16 ]. The average monthly household income was calculated by dividing the average household income in the previous year by 12. Equivalized household income was defined as the average monthly household income divided by the square root of the number of household members [ 19 ]. The study participants were divided into 4 groups according to the quartiles of equivalized household income.

The mean CVH score of study participants was 8.80 (SD 2.46). The weighted mean age of study participants was 37.5 (SE 0.26) years, and more than two-thirds (2888/5691, 69.3%) were aged 18-44 years. Approximately half (n=3075, 49.6%) of the participants had less than 12 years of education, and one-fifth (n=888, 19.5%) had no health insurance. In male participants, 41.1% (n=1036), 50.2% (n=1265), and 8.7% (n=220) showed poor, intermediate, and ideal CVH, respectively. The mean age, the proportion of employees, self-employment, and use of aspirin were likely to be higher in participants with poor CVH (all P <.001). In female participants, 20.5% (n=649), 61.3% (n=1943), and 18.2% (n=578) showed poor, intermediate, and ideal CVH, respectively.

The mean age and the proportion of aspirin and of statin use were likely to be higher in those with poor CVH (all P <.001). Those with less than 12 years of education were more likely to have poorer CVH ( P =.001).
Table 1 shows the results of multinomial logistic regression regarding the association between education, health insurance, and CVH categories. Of the total participants, using ideal CVH as a reference, those with less than 12 years of education were not associated with intermediate and poor CVH after adjusting for potential covariates (intermediate CVH: OR 1.12, 95% CI 0.91-1.40; poor CVH: OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.78-1.29). Similarly, of the total participants, those without health insurance were not associated with intermediate and poor CVH, respectively (intermediate CVH: OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.73-1.28; poor CVH: OR 1.19, 95% CI 0.85-1.67).

For both male and female participants, low education level and absence of health insurance were not associated with intermediate and poor CVH.
However, as a result of stratification according to quartiles of monthly household income, participants with less than 12 years of education in the Q1 (lowest household income) and Q2 groups were associated with a 2.42 (95% CI 1.30-4.51) and 1.90 (95% CI 1.08-3.33) times higher likelihood of poor CVH, respectively ( Figure 1 and Table S2 in Multimedia Appendix 1 ). These associations were consistently found when defining low education level as less than 11 years (data not shown).

Discussion
For all participants, having less education or no health insurance was not associated with CVH; however, stratified analyses by monthly household income quartiles showed that having less education or no health insurance was associated with poor CVH in the lowest household income groups. These CVH disparities were more pronounced among female individuals and young adults. This study contributes to establishing policies implementation that reduces the disparity of CVH, the most notable cause of disease burden, by presenting the basis for prioritizing a vulnerable population.

For example, health service delivery guidelines should include consideration of the link between SDH and CVD, and training for health care providers should emphasize this. Low levels of education may be associated with low levels of health literacy for CVD prevention and management practices [ 24 , 25 ]. Therefore, health care providers should assess the health literacy levels of their target population and provide interventions that take this into account.
There was a gap in the prevalence of CVD risk factors according to the WHO region or income level; Mongolia is a country with a high prevalence of CVD risk factors [ 26 ] . For example, nonelevated blood pressure, one of the tracer indicators for calculating the universal health coverage service coverage index, was 29, indicating the low coverage of blood pressure management in Mongolia [ 26 ] .

Further, the linear trends in cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking, obesity, and elevated blood pressure among Mongolian adults are all projected to be significantly higher than the global target by 2025 [ 27 ] . Thus, there is a need for the adoption and dissemination of cardiovascular risk-factor management guidelines. The WHO-initiated STEPS in 2002 is practical and helpful in monitoring the status of CVH and can identify the achievement rate for each cardiovascular risk factor, thereby aiding the formulation of effective health policies for managing risk factors at a country level [ 16 ] .

The association between education level and CVH is inconsistent in previous studies. A cross-sectional study of 7771 nationally representative participants aged ≥25 years in the United States reported that participants with at least a college degree were 4.12 times more likely to have ideal CVH status than participants with less than a high school education [ 28 ] . However, a recent cross-sectional study of 1634 Asian American adults aged ≥20 years in the United States revealed that low educational attainment was associated with a low likelihood of having ideal CVH compared to high educational attainment after adjusting for age and sex; however, this association became nonsignificant after additionally adjusting for income category and nativity status [ 26 ] .

Further studies are needed to comprehensively understand the relationship between educational attainment and CVH in the contexts of including other SDH, such as income and race, for health equity in populations that are vulnerable to CVH problems.
Mongolia implemented a social health insurance system in 1994 to maintain equity in access to health care. Consequently, 95.6% of the population has been covered by social health insurance since 2017 [ 29 , 30 ] . Despite this high health insurance coverage rate, health expenses are significantly related to poverty in Mongolia, with pronounced consequences in households with patients with NCD [ 31 ] . Our study also showed that the population without health insurance had a higher risk of poor CVH status in the lowest income group than in the higher income groups, which is consistent with the previous study [ 32 ] .
In this study, the"
PMC10724809,PMC10724809_chunk_32,"ation without health insurance had a higher risk of poor CVH status in the lowest income group than in the higher income groups, which is consistent with the previous study [ 32 ] .
In this study, the CVH disparities according to SDH were predominant in female individuals and young adults. Mongolia is ranked 69th out of 156 countries in the global gender gap index, and the score of estimated earned income among the subitems measuring this index was 0.67 (0.00=imparity, 1.00=parity) [ 33 ] . Numerous previous studies support the sex differences in cardiovascular risk factors and diseases [ 34 - 36 ] . Our study revealed that low education level or lack of health insurance contributed more to poor CVH, especially among low-income female individuals. Furthermore, a history of CVD in Mongolians currently appears in relatively young population groups; an increase in CVD at a young age is a remarkable health issue [ 5 ] . Therefore, efforts to promote CVH that consider sex and age, such as i"
PMC10724809,PMC10724809_chunk_33,"s currently appears in relatively young population groups; an increase in CVD at a young age is a remarkable health issue [ 5 ] . Therefore, efforts to promote CVH that consider sex and age, such as interventions for modifying CVH for young adults or creating strategies that target gender equality, might be needed to achieve health equity in Mongolia. In countries with limited universal health coverage such as Mongolia, a strategy of using text messages to target younger populations may be useful in managing hypertension to prevent CVD, as identified in a previous research review [ 37 ].
The strength of this study was that, to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to identify the sex and age differences in the association between SDH and CVH according to income among Mongolian adults. Further, we used nationally representative Mongolian data to minimize external validity threats.

This study has some limitations. First, it is possible that participants who had less than 12 years of education but completed all public education courses were grouped together with those who did not complete public education courses. This can be attributed to the gradual change of public education in Mongolia from 10 years in 2004 to 12 years in 2013. Thus, we performed the sensitivity analysis by dividing the education level based on 11 years and confirmed that the results were similar to our primary results. Second, we measured salt consumption as the diet component of CVH, which is not a guideline in Life’s Simple 7. Third, there is a possibility of misclassification of self-reported variables.

The STEPS Mongolia cross-sectional survey began in 2005 and has been conducted 4 times every 4 to 6 years. Further research is needed to identify trends in CVH following structural SDH in order to prioritize risk factors that have not been improved over time. Fifth, the STEPS data did not provide information on individual residence, limiting our ability to determine the impact of residence on health. Although we found that living in a rural area was associated with lower CVH compared with urban area, we suggest including variables related to residence because even within the same rural area, there may be differences in the environment in which people live (Table S5 in Multimedia Appendix 1 ). Lastly, although we adjusted potential cofounders, there might still be a chance of residual confounding we did not control for.

In conclusion, we confirmed that in Mongolia, where universal health coverage is low, the population group that has low structural socioeconomic levels and health care coverage is more vulnerable to CVH problems. As in other low-income countries, female individuals are more vulnerable to poor CVH than male individuals, suggesting that this vulnerability can only be improved when fundamental problems such as structural health determinants are addressed. Strategies and interventions aimed at reducing the CVH disparity in the Mongolian population should be prioritized for female individuals and young adults (aged 18-44 years) with low socioeconomic status and without health insurance.

The WHO-initiated STEPS in 2002 is practical and helpful in monitoring the status of CVH and can identify the achievement rate for each cardiovascular risk factor, thereby aiding the formulation of effective health policies for managing risk factors at a country level [ 16 ] . Establishing a high-vulnerability priority population in population health is essential for ensuring universal health in which no one is excluded.
The association between education level and CVH is inconsistent in previous studies.

However, a recent cross-sectional study of 1634 Asian American adults aged ≥20 years in the United States revealed that low educational attainment was associated with a low likelihood of having ideal CVH compared to high educational attainment after adjusting for age and sex; however, this association became nonsignificant after additionally adjusting for income category and nativity status [ 26 ] . Further studies are needed to comprehensively understand the relationship between educational attainment and CVH in the contexts of including other SDH, such as income and race, for health equity in populations that are vulnerable to CVH problems.

Mongolia implemented a social health insurance system in 1994 to maintain equity in access to health care. Consequently, 95.6% of the population has been covered by social health insurance since 2017 [ 29 , 30 ] . Despite this high health insurance coverage rate, health expenses are significantly related to poverty in Mongolia, with pronounced consequences in households with patients with NCD [ 31 ] . Our study also showed that the population without health insurance had a higher risk of poor CVH status in the lowest income group than in the higher income groups, which is consistent with the previous study [ 32 ] .
In this study, the CVH disparities according to SDH were predominant in female individuals and young adults. Mongolia is ranked 69th out of 156 countries in the global gender gap index, and the score of estimated earned income among the subitems measuring this index was 0.67 (0.00=impa"

Mongolia is ranked 69th out of 156 countries in the global gender gap index, and the score of estimated earned income among the subitems measuring this index was 0.67 (0.00=imparity, 1.00=parity) [ 33 ] . Numerous previous studies support the sex differences in cardiovascular risk factors and diseases [ 34 - 36 ] . Our study revealed that low education level or lack of health insurance contributed more to poor CVH, especially among low-income female individuals. Furthermore, a history of CVD in Mongolians currently appears in relatively young population groups; an increase in CVD at a young age is a remarkable health issue [ 5 ] . Therefore, efforts to promote CVH that consider sex and age, such as interventions for modifying CVH for young adults or creating strategies that target gender equality, might be needed to achieve health equity in Mongolia. In countries with limited universal health coverage such as Mongolia, a strategy of using text messages to target "
PMC10724809,PMC10724809_chunk_43,"es that target gender equality, might be needed to achieve health equity in Mongolia. In countries with limited universal health coverage such as Mongolia, a strategy of using text messages to target younger populations may be useful in managing hypertension to prevent CVD, as identified in a previous research review [ 37 ].
The strength of this study was that, to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to identify the sex and age differences in the association between SDH and CVH according to income among Mongolian adults. Further, we used nationally representative Mongolian data to minimize external validity threats.
Limitations
This study has some limitations. First, it is possible that participants who had less than 12 years of education but completed all public education courses were grouped together with those who did not complete public education courses. This can be attributed to the gradual change of public education in Mongolia from 10 years in 2004 to 12 years in "
PMC10724809,PMC10724809_chunk_44,"urses were grouped together with those who did not complete public education courses. This can be attributed to the gradual change of public education in Mongolia from 10 years in 2004 to 12 years in 2013. Thus, we performed the sensitivity analysis by dividing the education level based on 11 years and confirmed that the results were similar to our primary results. Second, we measured salt consumption as the diet component of CVH, which is not a guideline in Life’s Simple 7. Third, there is a possibility of misclassification of self-reported variables. Fourth, we used the most recent fourth survey to determine the latest findings on the association between SDH and CVH. The STEPS Mongolia cross-sectional survey began in 2005 and has been conducted 4 times every 4 to 6 years.

Fifth, the STEPS data did not provide information on individual residence, limiting our ability to determine the impact of residence on health. Although we found that living in a rural area was associated with lower CVH compared with urban area, we suggest including variables related to residence because even within the same rural area, there may be differences in the environment in which people live (Table S5 in Multimedia Appendix 1 ). Lastly, although we adjusted potential cofounders, there might still be a chance of residual confounding we did not control for.

As in other low-income countries, female individuals are more vulnerable to poor CVH than male individuals, suggesting that this vulnerability can only be improved when fundamental problems such as structural health determinants are addressed. Strategies and interventions aimed at reducing the CVH disparity in the Mongolian population should be prioritized for female individuals and young adults (aged 18-44 years) with low socioeconomic status and without health insurance."

Advances in cardiovascular prevention have led to a decrease in hospitalizations for acute myocardial infarction (MI) in the US over the past few decades. 1 , 2 However, recent data suggest that hospitalizations for acute MI in younger adults have not seen the same decline and may be increasing. 3 , 4 , 5 One reason for this may be the earlier development of obesity and its associated cardiovascular risk factors. Multiple studies have demonstrated the increasing prevalence of obesity in adolescents and younger adults, 6 , 7 which is strongly associated with continued obesity in adulthood. 8 This leads to earlier development of cardiometabolic risk factors including hyperlipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hypertension, and elevated blood glucose. 9 Chronic exposure to these risk factors at earlier ages increases the risk of developing premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Younger individuals are less likely to undergo cardiovascular risk assessment and are"

Younger individuals are less likely to undergo cardiovascular risk assessment and are less likely to be eligible for preventative therapies when they do undergo assessment. 10 Ultimately, this allows the development of clinical ASCVD that may otherwise be attenuated. 11
ST‐elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is a unique subset of MI associated with a high risk for morbid cardiovascular complications and therefore warrants emergent treatment regardless of age. Prevention of STEMI remains of utmost importance to the maintenance of optimal cardiovascular health. To optimize the approach to prevention of STEMI in younger adults, a better understanding of the demographics and risk factors in this population is needed. In this analysis, we sought to determine the clinical characteristics of young STEMI patients (<50 years), their cardiovascular risk at the time of STEMI, and"

RESULTS
A total of 821 patients met inclusion criteria for this sample. Of these, 186 patients (23%) had a nonatherosclerotic etiology of their STEMI, leaving 635 patients with STEMI due to atherosclerotic disease available for analysis. The majority of the cohort were men (82.4%) and identified as white (89%) (Table 1 ). The median age was 46.0 [42.0–48.0] years, with a heavily left‐skewed distribution of 524 patients (83%) age 41–50 years, while only 8 (1.3%) were age 21–30 years.

We performed a retrospective analysis of a prospective cohort of 635 patients aged ≤50 years who presented with STEMI due atherosclerotic disease to examine the clinical characteristics, risk factors, medication use, and statin eligibility based on the most recent guidelines for this population. The most prevalent risk factor was smoking, followed by hyperlipidemia and hypertension. Diabetes and drug use were relatively uncommon. Median LDL was not significantly elevated in the cohort and approximately half of young individuals experiencing STEMI were not eligible for statin therapy before their event.
Prior cohorts have examined MI in younger adults. The Partners YOUNG‐MI registry retrospectively examined a cohort of 2097 patients aged ≤50 years who presented with MI. 17 While this cohort included patients with NSTEMI and patients with nonatherosclerotic coronary disease (spontaneous coronary artery dissection, MI with nonobstructive coronary arteries), many of its findings "

Only 19.8% of the cohort had diabetes at the time of their admission and rates of drug use (cocaine or marijuana) was also low at 10.9%. Lipid panels were remarkably similar as well. The mean total cholesterol was 192 mg/dL, with mildly depressed HDL‐C of 37 mg/dL, a mildly elevated LDL‐C of 119 mg/dL, and normal median triglyceride of 150 mg/dL.

While cardiovascular risk factors are prevalent throughout the cohort, examining them in light of the prevalence of risk factors in the general adult population in the United States yields additional insights. When compared to data in adults ≥20 years from the 2017–2020 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, the prevalence of hypertension was somewhat lower in this cohort (36.7% vs. 46.7%) while the prevalence of hyperlipidemia was somewhat higher (44.2% vs. 34.7%). 18 Diabetes was similarly prevalent in both groups (12.9% vs. 14.1%). Total cholesterol in this cohort was similar to that in adults ≥20 years (189.0 vs. 187.2 mg/dL), however, HDL‐C was lower (35.4 vs. 53.6 mg/dL) and triglycerides were higher (148 vs. 91.6 mg/dL).

Only 19.8% of the cohort had diabetes at the time of their admission and rates of drug use (cocaine or marijuana) was also low at 10.9%. Lipid panels were remarkably similar as well. The mean total cholesterol was 192 mg/dL, with mildly depressed HDL‐C of 37 mg/dL, a mildly elevated LDL‐C of 119 mg/dL, and normal median triglyceride of 150 mg/dL.

Additionally, several variables had high rates of missing data. Namely, over half of individuals had missing hemoglobin A1c% values.

Similarly, lipid profile, aspirin, and statin data were unavailable in roughly 15%–24% of individuals in this study. We were able to adjust for this via imputation in the statin eligibility analysis. A sensitivity analysis excluding imputed data did not reveal substantial differences in statin eligibility.
CONCLUSION
Younger adults with STEMI exhibit high rates of tobacco use and low rates diabetes and drug use. Preventative medication use was also low in this cohort, which may in part be due to the underascertainment of ASCVD risk in this population using conventional risk assessment methods. Developing risk stratification methods better calibrated for a younger population may help identify and treat younger adults at high risk for an ASCVD event.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a global health crisis 1 . SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded RNA virus with a high mutation rate 2 , 3 . Five SARS-CoV-2 variants (alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and omicron) have been identified by WHO as variants of concern. While approximately 80% of SARS-CoV-2 infections are mild to moderate, the clinical presentation and case fatality rate vary depending on the viral variant and comorbidities 4 , 5 . Thus, the infection fatality rates vary from 0.3 to 5%. The major causes of death are respiratory failure, sepsis/multi-organ failure, cardiac failure, hemorrhage, and renal failure 6 – 10 .

Post-mortem studies have demonstrated the presence of multi-organ thrombosis, even in asymptomatic patients and those on standard thromboprophylaxis 5 , 13 , 14 . While fibrin thrombi were observed in small arterial vessels in 87% of the samples analyzed, increased deposition of platelets and megakaryocytes with increased platelet-leukocyte aggregates has also been reported in pulmonary capillaries 15 – 18 . The incidence rate of thromboembolic events (e.g., venous thromboembolism, pulmonary embolism, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, bowel and limb ischemia) varies between studies. It is highest in critically ill and mechanically ventilated patients and worsens the prognosis 19 – 21 . The rate of arterial thromboembolism has been estimated at 2.8–8.4% 19 .

SARS-CoV-2 infection can promote thrombosis by several molecular and cellular mechanisms, including not only dysregulation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) and immune response but also platelet and endothelium function alterations 15 , 20 – 26 . Platelets play a major role in hemostasis, thrombosis, and inflammatory response 15 , 27 . COVID-19 is associated with platelet activation, increased tissue factor expression, and the formation of platelet-leukocyte aggregates. Activated platelets interact with dysfunctional endothelium and neutrophils, resulting in thrombogenesis 15 .
Nevertheless, the data on the use of antiplatelet (AP) therapy in COVID-19 patients are conflicting 28 – 30 . The meta-analysis by Wanting Su et al., which included 34 studies, showed that ASAmay reduce all-cause mortality in patients with COVID-19 by 15–20% 31 .

The complex relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and hemostatic dysfunction observed in COVID-19 patients is still not fully understood, and treatment outcomes remain unsatisfactory 32 . While antithrombotic treatment does not appear to protect against morbidity and mortality, there is a need for effective therapy to reduce the incidence of thromboembolic complications and improve outcomes 33 – 35 .
The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of AP treatment prior to COVID-19 infection on the clinical profile, in-hospital course, and short- and medium-term mortality of patients hospitalized with COVID-19. To compare the risk of death among patients with or without prior AP therapy, we conducted a propensity score matching (PSM).

The results of our study show that AP may have beneficial impact on the in-hospital course and medium-term mortality of patients hospitalized with COVID-19.

Importantly we have also found significantly lower inflammatory markers in the AP group, suggesting a potential mechanism in reducing the excessive inflammatory response, underlying the pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The study group consisted of COVID-19 patients hospitalized between 2020 and 2021. These patients faced more aggressive variants of the virus coupled with the absence of a vaccination program at that time. It should be emphasized, that the studied subgroups are characterized by a high number of comorbidities and risk factors, which probably largely determine a worse prognosis, when affected by COVID-19. Hence, AP in high cardiovascular risk groups could offer significant benefits and should be considered in COVID-19 even with more benign viral variants.

The more frequent coronary angiography and revascularization in the AP group may be linked to a higher incidence of pre-hospitalization coronary problems. Still, despite the greater number of comorbidities and vascular events during hospitalization, the overall prognosis was better in the AP group. A doubly robust estimation, with potential confounders, including medical treatment, also showed potential benefits of AP treatment.
Coronary artery disease (CAD) or PAD constitutes an indication for long-term AP therapy as secondary prevention. There were also patients with a history of MI in the non-AP group. The lack of AP treatment or its disconituation can be explained by the use of anticoagulation, according to the European guidelines, which recommend them as the only treatment usually after 12 months since MI 36 .

Anticoagulation has been shown to be more effective in preventing thromboembolic events in atrial fibrillation which may also explain the lower number of ischemic strokes and TIA in the non-AP group. Interestingly, a recent study reported that combination of therapeutic dose of heparin with AP did not improve outcome compared with therapeutic doses of heparin alone 29 .
Although AP treatment is a recognized risk factor for major bleeding, especially in long-term observation, in older patients, and without the routine proton-pump inhibitors (PPI) use 37 – 39 , we observed no significant differences in hemorrhagic complications between the groups. The use of PPI, given to one-third of AP-treated patients, may be a contributing factor.

Patients in the AP group were more frequently treated with ACEIs and β-blockers. The result of our study are consistent with large single-center registry in Poland, which found that treatment with ACEIs/ARBs, β-blockers, statins, or AP was associated with lower risk of in-hospital death in patients with COVID-19.

It was proven, that P2Y12 inhibitors (i.e. clopidgrel, ticagrelor, prasugrel) may reduce the platelet-related release of pro-inflammatory markers and the formation of platelet-leukocyte aggregates 15 – 18 , 43 . They can also increase endothelial nitric oxide bioavailability and reduce oxidative stress in patients with CAD 44 . ASA exerts not only anti-inflammatory effects but may have some antiviral activity on the level of viral ribonucleic acids 45 . In some studies, the pre-admission treatment with ASA was associated with better in-hospital outcomes and a reduced need for respiratory support 46 .

Therefore the AP effect could also be the effect of ongoing treatment not only before admission. There were no differences in the use of anticoagulation drugs during hospitalization.

PMC10921250,PMC10921250_chunk_1,"Introduction
The optimal duration and regimen of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) remain controversial. Current guidelines suggest that the optimal duration and regimen of DAPT depend on the clinical presentation and the device used for PCI. After drug-eluting stent implantation, DAPT is recommended for 6 months for patients with chronic coronary syndrome and for 12 months for patients with acute coronary syndrome. 1 , 2 , 3 Nevertheless, current guidelines suggest variations in the duration and regimen of DAPT according to the risk of bleeding or thrombosis in each patient. Therefore, in practice, the duration of DAPT after PCI is at the discretion of the physician. Current trends have shifted toward minimizing the risk of bleeding complications after PCI. 4 Various strategies to reduce the risk of bleeding by shortening the duration of DAPT have been evaluated. 5

According to recent randomized clinical trials, one of the leading strategies for more efficient management of the risk of bleeding and ischemia is to discontinue aspirin use after a brief period of DAPT and continue P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy. 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 The Short-Term Dual Antiplatelet Therapy After Deployment of Bioabsorbable Polymer Everolimus-Eluting Stent (SHARE) trial was performed to compare the results of 3-month DAPT followed by P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy with 12-month maintenance DAPT in all patients who underwent successful PCI with a drug-eluting stent.
Methods
This study was an investigator-initiated, multicenter, open-label, noninferiority randomized clinical trial conducted from December 15, 2017, through December 14, 2020, to demonstrate the noninferiority in the efficacy and safety of P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy following 3-month DAPT "

The trial was conducted at 20 hospitals in South Korea. The study protocol ( Supplement 1 ) was approved by the institutional review board of each participating center, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. An independent data and safety monitoring board reviewed the trial safety at regular intervals. The study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. 11 The study followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials ( CONSORT ) reporting guideline. 12 Patients with de novo coronary lesions who underwent successful PCI were eligible for enrollment for the study.

To minimize bias based on the stent type, only patients treated with the SYNERGY stent (Boston Scientific Corp) were included in this study. The SYNERGY stent is a bioabsorbable polymer everolimus-eluting stent designed to promote rapid reendothelialization by combining a thin-strut (74 μm to 81 μm) platinum-chromium platform with an abluminally coated ultrathin (4-μm), bioabsorbable polymer. 13 , 14 These features of the stent may allow shortened DAPT durations.
The major exclusion criteria for the study were hemodynamic instability or cardiogenic shock; increased risk of bleeding, anemia, or thrombocytopenia; need for oral anticoagulation therapy; noncardiac comorbid conditions with a life expectancy of less than 1 year; history of intracranial hemorrhage; and coronary stent implantation within 12 months before the index procedure.

Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy group (aspirin plus a P2Y12 inhibitor for 3 months followed by P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy) or the DAPT group (aspirin plus a P2Y12 inhibitor for 12 months) stratified by clinical presentation (chronic coronary syndrome or acute coronary syndrome) and enrollment sites. Enrollment and random assignment were performed within 3 months after the index procedure. A web-based response system was used for the randomization.
Clopidogrel was used as a P2Y12 inhibitor in patients with chronic coronary syndrome. For patients with acute coronary syndrome, ticagrelor was the recommended P2Y12 inhibitor; however, clopidogrel was also allowed at the physician’s discretion. "

For patients with acute coronary syndrome, ticagrelor was the recommended P2Y12 inhibitor; however, clopidogrel was also allowed at the physician’s discretion. Concomitant use of other antiplatelet agents or oral anticoagulants was not permitted. Optimal medical therapy, other than antiplatelet agents, was left to the physician’s discretion. Clinical follow-up was mandatory at 3, 6, and 12 months after index PCI. Telephonic interviews were permitted for patients who missed scheduled outpatient clinic visits.
The primary outcome was a net adverse clinical event (NACE), defined as a composite of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs) and major bleeding between 3 and 12 months after the index PCI. The MACCEs were defined as cardiac death, myocardial infarction (MI), stent thrombosis, stroke, or ischemia-driven target lesion revascularization.

Other secondary outcomes included cardiac death, MI, stent thrombosis, stroke, target lesion revascularization, target vessel revascularization, and all-cause death.
All deaths were assumed to be cardiac deaths unless a noncardiac cause could be identified. Myocardial infarction was defined as a creatine kinase–MB fraction or cardiac troponin elevation above the upper reference limit combined with ischemic symptoms, electrocardiographic changes, or a new regional wall motion abnormality.

All clinical events were adjudicated by an independent clinical event committee blinded to the treatment assignments.
At the time of the trial design, the annual event rate of the primary end point was expected to be approximately 5%, based on the results of several randomized clinical trials that compared short-term DAPT with 12-month DAPT after coronary PCI using drug-eluting stent implantation. 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 A noninferiority margin of 3.0% was chosen, considering that there was no clinical difference between the 2 groups in terms of the primary end point.

In the subgroup analysis, P values for interaction were estimated using the Cox proportional hazards regression model. All of the models were adjusted for clinical presentation and enrollment sites (stratification factors). As the same DAPT treatment was maintained in both groups until 3 months after the index procedure, only outcomes between 3 and 12 months after the index procedure were compared between the 2 groups. Owing to the lack of adjustment for multiple testing of subgroups, the results of the subgroup analyses should be considered exploratory. The findings of the analyses for secondary end points should also be interpreted as exploratory because of the possibility of type I error from multiple comparisons.

Results
From December 2017 to December 2020, a total of 1452 patients were enrolled, and 726 patients were randomly assigned to each group. Enrollment and random assignment may have been done within 3 months after the index PCI; however, most patients (>90%) were randomized within 3 days after the index PCI. There was no difference in the timing of randomization between the 2 groups. As we only considered events occurring between 3 and 12 months after the index procedure as primary end points, 65 patients were excluded from our analysis for various reasons before completion of the 3-month follow-up period. Therefore, a total of 1387 patients (mean [SD] age, 63.0 [10.7] years; 332 women [23.9%] and 1055 men [76.1%]) were assigned to P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy (n = 694) or DAPT (n = 693) ( Figure 1 ).

From December 2017 to December 2020, a total of 1452 patients were enrolled, and 726 patients were randomly assigned to each group. Enrollment and random assignment may have been done within 3 months after the index PCI; however, most patients (>90%) were randomized within 3 days after the index PCI. There was no difference in the timing of randomization between the 2 groups. As we only considered events occurring between 3 and 12 months after the index procedure as primary end points, 65 patients were excluded from our analysis for various reasons before completion of the 3-month follow-up period.

Discussion
In the SHARE randomized clinical trial, we demonstrated that P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy after 3-month DAPT was not inferior to 12-month DAPT in terms of the primary outcome of NACE in patients who underwent PCI. This study recruited patients with chronic coronary syndrome and acute coronary syndrome, including those with STEMI, who underwent suc"

This study recruited patients with chronic coronary syndrome and acute coronary syndrome, including those with STEMI, who underwent successful PCI. Our findings suggest that P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy after 3-month DAPT could be considered as a treatment option in a wide range of patients, including those with STEMI, who have undergone PCI using the latest generation of drug-eluting stents.
Among various strategies to reduce the risk of post-PCI bleeding, discontinuation of aspirin after short-term DAPT and switching to P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy have been the main focus of recent clinical trials. 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 These studies varied in terms of study population, type of P2Y12 inhibitor, and timing of transition or duration of P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy. Therefore, there are some discrepancies in their results regarding ischemic or bleeding risk reduction.

In the GLOBAL LEADERS trial, 10 ticagrelor monotherapy after 1 month of DAPT failed to demonstrate superiority in all-cause mortality or new Q-wave MI reduction compared with aspirin monotherapy after 12 months of DAPT. Moreover, it did not reduce the risk of major bleeding. In contrast, in the STOPDAPT-2 trial, 6 which used clopidogrel as a P2Y12 inhibitor and enrolled patients with relatively low ischemic risk, 1 month of DAPT followed by clopidogrel monotherapy reduced the bleeding end point and NACE compared with 12 months of DAPT. The SMART-CHOICE trial 7 demonstrated that P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy after 3-month DAPT was not inferior to 12-month DAPT for MACCEs. The bleeding rate was lower in the P2Y12 monotherapy group.
The TICO trial, 9 performed only in patients with acute coronary syndrome, showed that ticagrelor monotherapy after 3-mont"

The TICO trial, 9 performed only in patients with acute coronary syndrome, showed that ticagrelor monotherapy after 3-month DAPT, compared with 12-month DAPT, significantly reduced NACE at 1 year, mainly owing to the reduction in major bleeding. However, in the STOPDAPT-2 acute coronary syndrome trial, 21 clopidogrel monotherapy following 1 to 2 months of DAPT failed to prove noninferiority to 12-month DAPT for NACE despite a reduction in bleeding events in patients with acute coronary syndrome. Therefore, at least in patients with acute coronary syndrome, using a more potent P2Y12 inhibitor as monotherapy is expected to help reduce NACE; however, using DAPT for less than 3 months still needs to be sufficiently validated.

In our study’s subgroup analyses, there was a significant interaction between the antiplatelet strategy and sex for the occurrence of the primary outcome. Although several studies have demonstrated that women tend to have a higher risk of bleeding during DAPT compared with men, 22 , 23 , 24 it is difficult to draw conclusions from our study due to the low incidence of major bleeding.
In our study, only 1 type of drug-eluting stent, the SYNERGY stent, was used in the PCI to avoid difficulties in interpretation of the results from different stent types. Pathologically, third-generation drug-eluting stents have been reported to be superior to the second-generation ones in animal models and autopsy samples. 25 However, to our knowledge, no clinical data yet support the superiority of specific types of drug-eluting stents over others for early discontinuation of DAPT after PCI. 26

Current guidelines recommend shortening the DAPT duration after drug-eluting stent implantation in patients at high risk of bleeding. 1 , 2 , 3 Several drug-eluting stents, including the one used in our study, have been approved for use in these situations. 26 According to a meta-analysis of recent trials, early discontinuation of aspirin and maintenance of P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy did not increase the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events and reduced the risk of bleeding compared with standard, 12-month DAPT. 27 In light of recent clinical trials and our study, early discontinuation of aspirin and P2Y12 monotherapy after PCI with the latest drug-eluting stents may be applied to a broader patient population beyond that with a high risk of bleeding.

PMC10999870,PMC10999870_chunk_1,"Introduction
Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the main factor contributing to morbidity and mortality in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) worldwide ( Einarson et al., 2018 ). In a meta -analysis that included more than 4.5 million patients with T2DM representing Europe, the United States (US), and Western Pacific/China, the prevalence of CVD was estimated to be 32.2 % ( Einarson et al., 2018 ). Among those patients, 29.1 % had atherosclerosis, 21.2 % had coronary heart disease, and 14.9 % had heart failure (HF) ( Einarson et al., 2018 ). Moreover, CVD was the leading cause of death in 9.9 % of the included patients ( Einarson et al., 2018 ). In Saudi Arabia (SA), the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) report (from 2000 to 2045) shows that the estimated prevalence of coronary artery disease is at 7.3 %, cerebrovascular disease at 3.1 %, HF at 1.5 %, and nephropathy at 3.7 % in patients with diabetes ( International Diabetes Federation, 2022 ). Nevertheless, the pre"
PMC10999870,PMC10999870_chunk_2,"oronary artery disease is at 7.3 %, cerebrovascular disease at 3.1 %, HF at 1.5 %, and nephropathy at 3.7 % in patients with diabetes ( International Diabetes Federation, 2022 ). Nevertheless, the precise year when this prevalence was documented remains unclear. In the crude mortality rate in SA, diabetes mellitus ranks tenth among the top causes of death, with ischemic heart disease being the first and chronic kidney disease (CKD) being fourth ( The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2022 ). The Saudi Scientific Diabetes Society reports that more than 50 % of patients with T2DM die of CVD ( Robert and Al Dawish, 2021 ). However, the specific prevalence of CVD in patients with T2DM remains limited.
In 2008, the US Food and Drug Administration (U.S. FDA) mandated that manufacturers must evaluate all new antidiabetic drugs to assess their cardiovascular safety after several reports of the adverse cardiovascular effect of some of the commonly used antidiabetic agents ( Low "
PMC10999870,PMC10999870_chunk_3,"turers must evaluate all new antidiabetic drugs to assess their cardiovascular safety after several reports of the adverse cardiovascular effect of some of the commonly used antidiabetic agents ( Low Wang et al., 2019 ). This mandate has resulted in many cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) that demonstrated a reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), CKD, incidence of HF and HF-related hospitalization, and body weight. These benefits were heavily demonstrated in two new antidiabetic classes: sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA).

A meta -analysis that evaluated 8 CVOTs of SGLT2i demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in MACE by 10 % compared to a placebo group ( McGuire et al., 2021 ). This reduction was more evident in patients with ASCVD than without ASCVD (11 % reduction vs. 6 % reduction, respectively). On the other hand, a meta -analysis of 8 CVOTs of GLP-1 RA showed an overall reduction of MACE by 16 % in patients with a history of CVD compared to patients without a history of CVD (6 %) ( Giugliano et al., 2021 ). In the real world, a large report using US administrative claims data in 2015 for more than one million patients with T2DM showed that 45.2 % had established ASCVD with low overall use of SGLT2i or GLP-1 RA (<12 %), and this was"

Additionally, statin with lifestyle therapy and aspirin are recommended for individuals of all ages with T2DM and history of ASCVD secondary prevention of CVD. Furthermore, current guidelines recommend the addition of statin with lifestyle therapy for patients with T2DM and aged 40–75 years for primary prevention of CVD ( Davies et al., 2022 , de Boer et al., 2022 ).
The prevalence of CVD and renal diseases among patients with T2DM in SA is poorly reported ( Al Slail et al., 2016 ).

All patients who visited the outpatient endocrinology, cardiac, internal medicine, nephrology, family medicine, and obesity/bariatric clinics or were admitted to KAMC or KAAUH during the study period were assessed for inclusion in the study. Patients were eligible if they were at least 18 years old and had an established diagnosis of T2DM. Included patients were divided into two groups based on the presence or absence of ASCVD (i.e., coronary heart disease (CHD) manifested by myocardial infarction (MI), angina, cerebrovascular diseases such as transient ischemic attack (TIA), ischemic stroke, peripheral artery disease (PAD), revascularization including stent or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), or aortic atherosclerotic disease) as defined by the American College of Cardiology (ACC) ( The American College of Cardiology, 2022a ).

Results
Among the included 1,218 patients with T2DM, the mean age was 59.3 ± 13.1 years, with the majority being between 45 and 64 years old (53.0 %). The majority had no ASCVD (81.4 %, n = 991), while 18.6 % of these patients had established ASCVD (n = 227). The patients in the ASCVD group were older than patients in the non-ASCVD group (65.2 ± 11.7 vs. 58.0 ± 13.0 years). Female gender was more prevalent in our cohort at 57.0 %, with more females in the non-ASCVD group (59.8 % vs. 44.5 %). The mean body mass index (BMI) was 31.9 ± 6.5, with more patients being obese with a BMI ≥ 30.0 Kg/m 2 (58.3 %).

Discussion
This retrospective descriptive study aimed to assess the prevalence of ASCVD, HF, CKD, and obesity in individuals with T2DM in SA. The investigation was prompted by the limited available data on the prevalence of these significant complications associated with T2DM. Additionally, the study provided a detailed evaluation of the characteristics of the antidiabetic agents, statin, and aspirin therapies used in the cohort.
Within our cohort, we noted a lower prevalence of ASCVD at 18.6 %, in contrast to the 45.2 % reported in the United States ( Weng et al., 2019 ). However, it is essential to acknowledge the comparatively smaller sample size in our study. Comparing our findings to the IDF report on Saudi Arabia, we observed a higher prevalence of HF (1.5 % vs. 5.1 %) and CKD (3.7 % vs. 8.7 %) ( International Diabetes Federation, 2022 ). Generally,"

Comparing our findings to the IDF report on Saudi Arabia, we observed a higher prevalence of HF (1.5 % vs. 5.1 %) and CKD (3.7 % vs. 8.7 %) ( International Diabetes Federation, 2022 ). Generally, the prevalence of HF in individuals with T2DM has been estimated to range from 9 % to 22 %, which is four times higher than in the general population ( Nichols et al., 2004 , Dunlay et al., 2019 ). Additionally, a large meta -analysis in the Middle East, encompassing 59,395 patients, reported a higher prevalence of CKD in patients with T2DM at 28.96 % ( Naser et al., 2021 ). In our cohort, the prevalence of HF and CKD was higher in the ASCVD group, with rates of 17.2 % and 19.8 %, respectively, and more than half of these patients were obese (55.4 %).
Furthermore, within our cohort, 30.6 % of individuals in the non-ASCVD group exhibited a high risk for ASCVD. This subgroup of patients is recognized for their increased susceptibility to CVD and poorer clinical outcomes ( American Diabetes "
PMC10999870,PMC10999870_chunk_47," individuals in the non-ASCVD group exhibited a high risk for ASCVD. This subgroup of patients is recognized for their increased susceptibility to CVD and poorer clinical outcomes ( American Diabetes Association Professional Practice Committee, 2022 ). The prevalence of obesity in our cohort was notable, with 58.3 % of individuals affected, aligning with similar reports in SA where obesity rates in individuals with T2DM were documented as 62 % in Al-Khobar and 57.9 % in Bisha cities ( AlShahrani, 2021 , Jatoi et al., 2022 ).
Moreover, the prevalence of smoking in our study was 7.6 % overall, with a higher prevalence observed in the ASCVD group at 13.2 %. Comparatively, other cross-sectional studies in SA reported smoking rates in individuals with diabetes at 9.4 % in 2005 ( Saeed, 2012 ), and 13.2 % in 2021 ( Almubark et al., 2022 ). Additionally, a higher prevalence of smoking was noted at 25.7 % in patients with diabetes in the US ( Clair et al., 2013 ). It's important to note that s"

Additionally, a higher prevalence of smoking was noted at 25.7 % in patients with diabetes in the US ( Clair et al., 2013 ). It's important to note that smoking has been linked to an elevated risk of CVD in individuals with diabetes compared to those without diabetes (HR 1.45; 95 % CI: 1.17–1.78) ( Yang et al., 2022 ).
The usage of SGLT2i in our study was relatively low, standing at 10.8 %, and even lower in the ASCVD group compared to the non-ASCVD group (8.8 % vs. 11.2 %). This pattern mirrors findings from the study by Weng et al., where SGLT2i utilization was reported at 8.8 % in the ASCVD group compared to 11.8 % in the non-ASCVD group ( Weng et al., 2019 ). Similarly, the utilization of GLP-1 RA was modest at 9.4 %, with an even lower prevalence in the ASCVD group compared to the non-ASCVD group (7.0 % vs. 10 %), consistent with observations in the Weng et al. study (7.9 % vs. 9.2 %).

This low utilization of SGLT2i and GLP-1 RA in patients with established ASCVD who need them the most requires further investigation. The combined use of either SGLT2i or GLP-1 RA in our cohort was 18.4 %, which exceeds the overall usage reported in the Weng et al. study (<12 %). This difference could be attributed to the fact that the study by Weng et al. was based on older data from 2015. A broader study involving 95,569 patients with T2DM from Cleveland Clinic demonstrated lower rates of GLP-1 RA and SGLT2i utilization in patients with CVD (4.1 % vs. 2.5 %, respectively) ( Pantalone et al., 2018 ). However, it is noteworthy that this study was conducted in 2016, predating the current guidelines that emphasize the use of such therapies.

In a more recent evaluation based on data from the US Department of Veterans Affairs and among 537,980 patients with T2DM and established ASCVD, 11.2 % utilized SGLT2i and 8.0 % utilized GLP-1 RA underscoring the continuous low utilization of these new antidiabetic agents ( Mahtta et al., 2022 ).
All in all, the adoption of new guidelines-recommended therapies for patients with T2DM was notably low in this study. Several factors could contribute to this observation, including limited awareness among clinicians, medication availability, associated therapy costs, concerns about increased side effects, especially in elderly patients, the risk of hypoglycemia, and the presence of comorbidities that may contraindicate the use of these therapies ( Pantalone et al., 2018 , Khunti et al., 2022 ).

The assessment conducted in this study gains particular significance in light of the recent updates to joint guidelines by major professional organizations. These updates emphasize the utilization of SGLT2i and GLP-1 RA as first-line therapy for patients at high risk or with established ASCVD, HF, CKD, and obesity ( Davies et al., 2022 , de Boer et al., 2022 ).
The profile of other antidiabetic agents used in this study revealed that the majority of patients were undergoing metformin therapy (83.6 %), and a considerable proportion were on two or more OADs (44.3 %). Notably, patients with established ASCVD had lower usage of metformin than patients without ASCVD which could be attributed to the higher rate of CKD in patients with established ASCVD limiting the usage of metformin in this population. The overall high prevalence of metformin use aligns with adherence to previous guidelines th"

The overall high prevalence of metformin use aligns with adherence to previous guidelines that underscored the initiation of metformin as the first-line therapy for T2DM ( Davies et al., 2018 , American Diabetes Association, 2021 ). Anticipating a notable shift in these practices in the years to come, we expect increased adoption of SGLT2i and GLP-1 RA as first-line therapies. This shift is supported by accumulating evidence demonstrating their benefits beyond glucose-lowering activity. However, implementing this paradigm change in the management of T2DM will necessitate extensive efforts in continuous medical education for healthcare providers. Additionally, the involvement of stakeholders in facilitating access to these therapies, along with the expansion of prescribing privileges to healthcare providers, will be crucial components of this evolving landscape.

Moreover, cardioprotective agents such as statin therapy and aspirin were employed in 79.7 % and 35.2 % of the study participants, respectively. Within the non-ASCVD group, 77.3 % received statin therapy for primary prevention in alignment with guideline recommendations ( American Diabetes Association Professional Practice Committee, 2022 ). However, it is noteworthy that 14.8 % of non-ASCVD patients were under the age of 45, and guidelines typically do not recommend initiating statin therapy for primary prevention in patients < 40 years old. This indicates an estimated missed opportunity in roughly 7.9 % of these patients. Conversely, in the ASCVD group, the utilization of statin therapy for secondary prevention was high at 90.3 %, with underutilization observed in 9.7 % of the patients. A comparable but h"

Conversely, in the ASCVD group, the utilization of statin therapy for secondary prevention was high at 90.3 %, with underutilization observed in 9.7 % of the patients. A comparable but higher proportion of statin nonusers (18.9 %) was reported in patients with T2DM in Malaysia ( Hammad et al., 2019 ).. Among the ASCVD group in this study, only 70.1 % were on aspirin therapy, underscoring the underutilization of aspirin in 29.9 % of these high-risk patients. Similarly, in a large cross-sectional analysis from 2011 to 2018 in the US, aspirin was utilized in only 70.3 % of patients with T2DM and a history of CVD ( Liu et al., 2021 ). However, the presence of contraindications and side effects (such as myopathies and a history of bleeding) may have contributed to the lower reported rates of statin and aspirin utilization in the literature. The challenge lies in the poor documentation of these contraindications and side effects. Therefore, it is crucial to evaluate strategies "

Therefore, it is crucial to evaluate strategies aimed at reducing undesirable cardiovascular outcomes, aligning with guidelines and recommendations, to enhance overall clinical outcomes ( American Diabetes Association Professional Practice Committee, 2022 ).
This cross-sectional analysis is subject to certain limitations that warrant consideration. Firstly, the study is constrained by the small sample size, focusing exclusively on patients with T2DM from two healthcare centers located in the central region of SA. The limited geographic scope may impact the generalizability of the findings to a broader population. Furthermore, the absence of an evaluation of clinical outcomes constitutes a notable limitation. Without such assessments, the complete understanding of the impact of these epidemiological findings, as well as the variation in "

Without such assessments, the complete understanding of the impact of these epidemiological findings, as well as the variation in the prescription patterns of cardiorenal protective antidiabetic agents, remains incomplete. A comprehensive analysis of clinical outcomes would have provided valuable insights into the effectiveness of different therapeutic approaches and their implications for patient health. Therefore, while the study sheds light on certain aspects of T2DM management, it is essential to interpret the findings with caution, considering the constraints imposed by the small sample size and the absence of clinical outcomes’ evaluation. Future research endeavors with larger and more diverse cohorts, along with a comprehensive assessment of clinical outcomes, would contribute to a more robust understanding of the implications of prescribing patterns in this context.

Conclusions
ASCVD, HF, CKD, and obesity are prevalent complications in patients with T2DM in SA. It is imperative that collaborative efforts be undertaken by both governmental and nongovernmental entities to address these diseases and enhance overall clinical outcomes. Recent consensus guidelines recommend the use of SGLT2i and GLP-1 RA (depending on specific patient’s characteristics, availability of medication, and failure of initial management strategies such as lifestyle modifications) as first-line therapies in T2DM. Thus, there is a need for concerted efforts to implement and monitor adherence to these recommendations among healthcare professionals. Additionally, attention should be focused on cardioprotective therapies, such as statins and aspirin, during outpatient clinic visits for patients with T2DM. These therapies shoul"

Additionally, attention should be focused on cardioprotective therapies, such as statins and aspirin, during outpatient clinic visits for patients with T2DM. These therapies should be employed whenever feasible, particularly in the absence of contraindications or side effects. By addressing these aspects comprehensively and collaboratively, there is an opportunity to improve the management of T2DM and reduce the burden of associated complications, ultimately leading to better clinical outcomes for patients in SA.

ADAPTABLE was an open‐label, multicenter, patient‐centered, and pragmatic randomized trial comparing daily doses of aspirin of 81 mg versus 325 mg in patients with established ASCVD ( NCT02697916 ). The methods and results have been published separately previously. 4 , 25 In brief, 15 076 patients from 40 centers and 1 health plan from the National Patient‐Centered Clinical Research Network were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either dose of aspirin. Patients were required to have established ASCVD and to have at least 1 enrichment factor (including age ≥65 years) that would further increase their estimated risk of an incident ASCVD event. Baseline demographic characteristics were patient self‐reported, and baseline medical history and comorbidities were ascertained from electronic health records queries.

The primary effectiveness end point was time to death from any cause, hospitalization for myocardial infarction (MI), or hospitalization for stroke. Prespecified secondary effectiveness end points were the individual components of the primary composite end point and coronary revascularization (either PCI or coronary artery bypass graft).

The association between age and the end points was analyzed using Cox proportional hazard models. The secondary effectiveness end points were compared with the use of the Fine and Gray method to take into account the competing risk of death from any cause. The proportional‐hazards assumption was checked with the use of weighted Schoenfeld residuals. Event counts and cumulative incidence rates estimated at median follow‐up in each treatment group using the Kalbfleisch–Prentice nonparametric estimator of the cumulative incidence function are presented, as well as unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs estimated from the models.

Because the association between age and risk of end points was not linear, age was parameterized as a linear spline with an inflection point at 65 years for all end points except for hospitalizations for stroke and coronary revascularization. This parameterization allows for 2 terms for age, to account for the fact that the association between age and end points did not follow the same pattern in these 2 age groups.

The association between age and the end points was analyzed using Cox proportional hazard models. The secondary effectiveness end points were compared with the use of the Fine and Gray method to take into account the competing risk of death from any cause. The proportional‐hazards assumption was checked with the use of weighted Schoenfeld residuals. Event counts and cumulative incidence rates estimated at median follow‐up in each treatment group using the Kalbfleisch–Prentice nonparametric estimator of the cumulative incidence function are presented, as well as unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs estimated from the models. Because the association between age and risk of end points was not linear, age was parameterized as a linear spline with an inflection point at 65 years for all end points except for hospitalizations for stroke and coronary revascularization.

A total of 15 076 participants were randomized to aspirin 81 mg (n=7540) or 325 mg (n=7536) daily between April 2016 and June 2019. Median follow‐up was 26.2 months (interquartile range: 19.0–34.9 months) and was similar among participants <65 years (n=9235 [61.3%]) and ≥65 years (n=9235 [61.3%]; P =0.1651). Randomization to both aspirin doses was also similar between patients <65 and ≥65 years ( P =0.6815). At baseline, patients aged ≥65 years had more peripheral artery disease, atrial fibrillation or flutter, coronary artery disease, hyperlipemia, or chronic kidney disease than patients aged <65 years, but a lower proportion had diabetes and congestive heart failure (Table 1 ). Patients aged ≥65 years less frequently had a history of bleeding (7.8% versus 9.9%; P <0.0001) and significant gastrointestinal bleeding (5.9% versus 7.5%; P =0.0001).

Gray's test statistic is reported at 26.2 months from randomization (the median follow‐up time for all‐cause mortality in ADAPTABLE).
When analyzing the association between age and clinical outcomes (regardless of aspirin dose), a primary effectiveness end point occurred in 1159 (7.7%) participants (417 in participants aged <65 years, and 742 in participants aged ≥65 years). Before the age of 65, the risk of a primary effectiveness end point did not significantly increase with age after adjusting for covariates (unadjusted HR for 5‐year age increase, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.87–0.97]; adjusted HR, 0.94 for 5‐year age increase [95% CI, 0.89–1.00]).

At age 65, the risk of a primary effectiveness end point began to increase significantly with age, with and without covariate adjustment (unadjusted HR, 1.23 [95% CI, 1.16–1.29]; adjusted HR, 1.21 [95% CI, 1.14–1.27]).

Discussion
In this secondary analysis of the pragmatic, multicenter ADAPTABLE randomized trial, the main findings are that, in patients with established ASCVD: (1) there is no interaction between age and daily aspirin doses of 81 mg or 325 mg in terms of effectiveness and safety; and (2) adherence t"
PMC11010083,PMC11010083_chunk_25,"main findings are that, in patients with established ASCVD: (1) there is no interaction between age and daily aspirin doses of 81 mg or 325 mg in terms of effectiveness and safety; and (2) adherence to the randomized dose of aspirin was similar in both age groups. As a secondary analysis of a trial that did not show a difference in safety and efficacy outcomes between both doses of aspirin, these findings need to be interpreted as hypothesis generating and exploratory.
Strategies to minimize bleeding risk while maintaining appropriate antithrombotic protection is critical, particularly in elderly individuals, a population at higher risk of bleeding and ischemic events. 26 Until recently, there remained a clinical equipoise in the United States regarding the favored aspirin dose at discharge after an MI, with doses of 81 mg and 325 mg used in 35.6% and 60.9% of patients, respectively. 27 The main analysis of the ADAPTABLE trial demonstrated that there were no significant differences in "
PMC11010083,PMC11010083_chunk_26,"e after an MI, with doses of 81 mg and 325 mg used in 35.6% and 60.9% of patients, respectively. 27 The main analysis of the ADAPTABLE trial demonstrated that there were no significant differences in the risk of cardiovascular events or of hospitalizations for bleeding requiring transfusions between patients randomized to 81 mg and those randomized to 325 mg of aspirin daily, and our secondary analysis confirms that these results are consistent regardless of the age of the patient. 4 These findings have important implications given that older patients generally tend to have higher risks of both bleeding and ischemic events compared with younger patients while on antiplatelet therapy, 5 , 7 , 9 , 28 making antithrombotic decisions more challenging in this vulnerable subset. More specifically, gastrointestinal toxicity of aspirin increases with age, 8 , 29 , 30 which translates into more bleeding, as suggested by subgroup analysis of a large‐scale primary prevention trial in which the ri"
PMC11010083,PMC11010083_chunk_27,"y, gastrointestinal toxicity of aspirin increases with age, 8 , 29 , 30 which translates into more bleeding, as suggested by subgroup analysis of a large‐scale primary prevention trial in which the risk of major bleeding with aspirin increased with age. 31 We thus confirmed that aspirin doses of 81 mg or 325 mg both represent an appropriate choice in secondary prevention of ASCVD across the age spectrum.
In this analysis, the association between age and the primary effectiveness end point was nonlinear, with age being a risk factor only among those ≥65 years (regardless of aspirin dose). In the latter subgroup, all‐cause mortality was significantly and independently associated with increasing age but not the other components of the primary effectiveness end point. Although we previously demonstrated that the positive predictive value of the method for end point ascertainment used in ADAPTABLE (queries National Patient‐Centered Clinical Research Network's common data model) was accurate"

In the ADAPTABLE trial, the incidence of the primary bleeding end point was low (<1% incidence) and similar between study arms ( P =0.41). 4 This association was not modified by age in this secondary analysis ( P value for interaction=0.413 in patients <65 years, and 0.942 in patients ≥65 years).

Other types of clinically relevant bleeding events that were not associated with blood product transfusions might have occurred in an imbalanced fashion across aspirin assignment groups (81 mg versus 325 mg daily), but, by design, these data were not available in this study. The bleeding definition used in ADAPTABLE may have been insensitive, and a more liberal capture of moderate bleeds could have theoretically yielded larger differences in HRs. The 325 mg dose of aspirin does not induce additional COX‐1 inhibition compared with the 81 mg dose, yet its selectivity shifts to COX‐2 inhibition. 33 How this shift in COX selectivity with different aspirin doses translates into differences into clinically "

Because of this limitation, no definitive conclusion can be drawn from our data regarding safety of the 2 aspirin doses according to age.
Emerging antithrombotic strategies in patients with established ASCVD have recently been investigated and incorporated into clinical practice guidelines. 34 , 35 In the COMPASS (Rivaroxaban for the Prevention of Major Cardiovascular Events in Coronary or Peripheral Artery Disease) trial, the combination of rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily and aspirin 100 mg once daily was associated with a lower rate of the composite of cardiovascular death, stroke, or MI compared with aspirin alone in patients with stable ASCVD, at the expense of a "

Novel aspirin‐free antithrombotic strategies have also been studied in patients using a P2Y12 inhibitor after PCI. 36 , 37 , 38 In the TWILIGHT (Ticagrelor With Aspirin or Alone in High‐Risk Patients After Coronary Intervention) trial, age was not an effect modifier on bleeding and ischemic events in the comparison between"

Conclusions
In conclusion, in patients with established ASCVD, there are no age‐related significant differences in cardiovascular events or in hospitalizations for bleeding requiring blood product transfusions between daily doses of aspirin of 81 mg or 325 mg. The optimal antithrombotic regimen in older patients with stable ASCVD according to age remains to be studied in properly powered randomized trials.

Takotsubo syndrome (TS) is a form of heart failure characterized by transitory left ventricular dysfunction and often resembles myocardial infarction (MI) in the acute phase. 1 , 2 Several pathophysiological mechanisms, including excessive sympathetic stimulation and myocardial perfusion dysfunction, have been proposed to explain TS. 1 , 3 This syndrome often affects postmenopausal women and poses a differential diagnostic dilemma because it resembles MI. The diagnosis is based mainly on transient akinesia in apical segments detected by ventriculography or cardiac ultrasound without explanatory coronary angiography findings. 1 , 3
Although the medical community first described TS in 1990, 4 its importance has significantly increased worldwide in the past decade. As the cause of TS is still unknown, medical professionals have yet to establish the optimal treatment approach.

Extrapolating pharmacological treatments for acute MI and acute heart failure to TS can be dangerous and may result in severe consequences, including fatalities. 5 , 6 The optimal medical therapy for TS is still unknown, as no randomized controlled clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate the effects of pharmacological interventions.
Due to the transient nature of the disorder, it will be prudent to concentrate on supportive treatment. 1 , 7 However, pharmacological therapeutic approaches, such as beta‐blockers, antiplatelets, statins, and angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE‐Is), are frequently used. 8 , 9 Medical professionals may assume that treatments used for other conditions, such as MI and acute heart failure, will yield similar outcomes in TS. 10 However, the efficacy and safety of pharmacological treatments such as inotropes, beta‐blockers, antiplatelets, statins,"

We sought to evaluate the effect of pharmacological treatment received during hospitalization and after discharge on short‐ and long‐term survival in a large cohort of TS patients using comprehensive national Swedish registry data.
Methods
We included all hospitalized patients with TS who were reported to the Swedish Coronary Angiography and Angioplasty Registry (SCAAR) between June 2009 and March 2016. TS was defined according to the position statement document from the TS task force of the European Society of Cardiology Heart Failure Association. 1 All patients were included in the SCAAR and the Swedish Register of Information and Knowledge about Swedish Heart Intensive Care Admissions (RIKS‐HIA), which are part of the Swedish Web System for Enhancement "

Categorization into the groups stable angina, unstable angina/non‐ST‐elevation myocardial infarction (UA/NSTEMI), ST‐elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), and other is based on the initial indication for coronary angiography. Initial indications for angiography are guided by early clinical signs, laboratory markers of cell necrosis, and electrocardiogram findings.
In half (49.4%) of the 1724 patients, the indication for coronary angiography was non‐ST‐elevation acute coronary syndrome, which includes unstable angina and non‐ST‐elevation MI. The remainder were reported as ST‐elevation MI (25.9%), stable angina (4.3%), and other diagnoses (20.4%), including cardiac arrest, heart failure, valve disease, chest pain, and arrhythmias.

A total of 5.9% of patients had a history of MI, 2.9% had percutaneous coronary intervention, and 1.6% had undergone coronary artery bypass graft treatment. Coronary angiography revealed that most patients (79.1%) had normal coronaries or non‐obstructive disease, while 11.7% had a single‐vessel disease and 9.9% had a multivessel disease.
Before hospitalization, a considerable number of patients were already using beta‐blockers (27.8%), ACE‐Is (19.1%), and calcium antagonists (10.4%). Additionally, 16.1% of patients were using diuretics, 24.5% were taking aspirin, and 4.4% were taking oral anticoagulants.

All patients received at least one pharmaceutical intervention during hospitalization ( Table 2 ). Most were given beta‐blockers (77.8% orally and 8.3% intravenously) and antiplatelet medications [aspirin (66.7%) and P2Y 12 inhibitors (43.6%)]. Other medications included unfractionated and low‐molecular‐weight heparins (UH/LMWH) (65.3%), oral anticoagulants (11.3%), ACE‐Is (55.5%), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) (15.3%), statins (55.1%), diuretics (19.5% orally and 17.2% intravenously), inotropes (3.8%), and digoxin (1.3%).

The Kaplan–Meier curve illustrates the 30 day (A) and long‐term mortality (B) rates among patients diagnosed with Takotsubo syndrome. The median follow‐up duration of patients was 877 days (interquartile range: 383–1544), and the crude all‐cause mortality rates were found to be 3.9% and 16.7% at 30 day and long‐term follow‐up, respectively. Notably, the Kaplan–Meier curve demonstrated that the short‐ and long‐term mortality rates for patients with Takotsubo syndrome are comparable with those observed among patients with myocardial infarction.
The median follow‐up time was 877 days (interquartile range: 383–1544). According to the Kaplan–Meier estimator, the probability of all‐cause mortality was 2.5% after 30 days and 16.6% after 6 years.

Pharmacological interventions associated with increased mortality in TS included intravenous use of inotropes and diuretics and orally administered digoxin ( Figure 3 A ). Treatment with statins and UH/LMWH was associated with lower 30 day mortality, while statins and ACE‐Is were associated with lower long‐term mortality ( Figure 3 B ).

The time‐varying Cox regression model showed good predictive accuracy, with Harrell's C ‐index of 0.888, indicating the model's good discrimination ability. We detected collinearity between the variables sex and age, with a VIF of 26 (a VIF > 5 indicating collinearity), and thus, we excluded sex from the model. There was no evidence of collinearity among the other predictor variables. The sensitivity analysis results are displayed in Table 3 , indicating that the use of inotropes has the strongest association with mortality. To lose its statistical significance as an independent predictor of death at 30 days, an unmeasured confounder must have a risk ratio above 10. This is based on a prevalence of 70% in the inotrope‐exposed group and 10% in the inotrope‐unexposed group.

Discussion
Using data from the SWEDEHEART registry, we analysed the effect of pharmacological therapy on mortality in a large cohort of 1724 individuals with TS. Inotropes, diuretics, anticoagulants, ACE‐Is, and statins were significantly associated with short‐ and long‐term mortality among TS patients. ACE‐Is, statins, and UH/LMWH were associated with lower mortality in TS, whereas the opposite was noted for inotropes, diuretics, and digoxin. Aspirin, beta‐blockers, ARBs, P2Y 12 antagonists, and oral anticoagulants were neutral.
Previous studies 20 , 21 , 22 have indicated that the mortality rates in patients with TS are comparable with those observed in patients with MI. However, there appears to be a significant disparity in mortality rates between different countries and even within the same country across different regions. 22 It is reasonable to hypothesize that "

Researchers have evaluated multiple therapies in various study designs, including retrospective cohorts, case series, and meta‐analyses. Beta‐blockers, ACE‐Is/ARBs, and antiplatelets are the most frequently evaluated drugs. Except for some reports showing the possible therapeutic effect of levosimendan 23 and ACE‐I/ARB, 24 , 25 the evidence for effective treatment of TS is scarce. Given the pathophysiological role of catecholamines in TS, treatment with beta‐blockers may seem logical. However, only limited evidence supports using beta‐blockers 26 in these patients.

One of the most important findings of our study is that inotropes are strongly associated with increased mortality in TS. It is reasonable to think that inotropes were mainly used in TS patients with haemodynamic instability. However, it is crucial to keep in mind that inotropes may aggravate heart failure in patients with TS. This is consistent with the prevailing theory concerning the pathophysiology of TS, where catecholamines play an essential role in forming typical akinesia in apical segments. There is solid evidence that administering catecholamines to humans 27 and animals 28 causes the TS phenotype. Some data support the idea that levosimendan, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor with both inotropic and vasodilatory effects, might benefit the recovery of TS. 29 However, caution should be taken with all interventions reducing afterload in TS because ~25% of these patients may have left ventricular ou"

An increased risk of death was associated with the use of diuretics. In patients with acute heart failure, high‐dose diuretics or aggressive diuresis may exacerbate renal function, electrolyte abnormalities, and central haemodynamics. 33 Diuretic‐induced hypovolaemia may be more harmful in TS patients with left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.

Many patients with TS also have decreased peripheral vascular resistance, 34 and diuretic therapy may aggravate volume depletion and haemodynamic instability. Diuretics can also activate the sympathetic nervous system, which may be deleterious in TS as an overactivated sympathetic system and high catecholamine levels are regarded as central to TS pathophysiology. 35
Antiplatelet therapy was assessed in a recently published meta‐analysis, 36 with evidence suggesting its association with adverse outcomes; however, one study seemed to have influenced the conclusion. Aspirin and P2Y 12 inhibitors did not significantly associate with mortality. On the other hand, we discovered that anticoagulant therapy with UH/LMWH was associated with lower mortality.

The relatively common thrombo‐embolism observed in these individuals may be explained by a condition of blood hyperviscosity documented in the acute phase of TS. 37 , 38 More research is required to fully understand the potential preventive benefits of anticoagulation during the acute phase of TS.
In our study, ACE‐Is were associated with decreased long‐term mortality, while ARBs were not. A lack of power to show a statistically significant association may explain this discrepancy, as relatively few patients received ARBs. However, although commonly grouped because of their analogous inhibitory mechanism on the renin‐angiotensin system, ACE‐Is and ARBs have different sites of action. ACE‐Is block the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II by inhibiting the ACE, while ARBs block the binding of angiotensin II to the angiotensin II type 1 receptor.

While both medications effectively reduce the activation of the renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system, ACE‐Is may also affect the breakdown of other substances, such as bradykinin, which can lead to an increase in vasodilation and may have additional cardioprotective effects, such as inhibition of the central sympathetic system. ARBs, conversely, are more selective in their target receptor and may have less effect on other pathways. Another explanation is related to differences in dosing and individual patient characteristics. ACE‐Is and ARBs may be prescribed at different doses depending on the patients' characteristics, such as age, sex, comorbidities, and overall health status.

This observation is at least indirectly supported by a meta‐analysis in heart failure patients in which ACE‐Is, but not ARBs, reduced all‐cause mortality and cardiovascular deaths. 39
Despite being favourable in our assessment of TS, statins have not been well explored so far. To the best of our knowledge, no other investigation has reported a favourable connection with mortality in TS. Statins have anti‐inflammatory properties, and TS is thought to be associated with the complex interplay of inflammatory processes. By reducing inflammation, statins may help moderate some of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms involved in TS, improving outcomes. Second, statins are commonly prescribed for their cholesterol‐lowering effects, but they may also have additional benefits for the cardiovascular system, such as improving endothelial "

Second, statins are commonly prescribed for their cholesterol‐lowering effects, but they may also have additional benefits for the cardiovascular system, such as improving endothelial function and reducing oxidative stress. These effects may help to improve overall cardiovascular health and reduce the risk of complications in patients with TS. Hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidaemia are common comorbidities associated with TS. Statins are frequently prescribed for managing these comorbidities; therefore, patients with TS who are already taking statins may have better control of their underlying conditions, which may improve survival.

However, several limitations of the registry need to be addressed. Because of the registry's observational and non‐experimental nature, no definitive causal relationship between pharmacological interventions and mortality can be made. The lack of detailed information on the route of administration, daily doses, and length of treatment makes interpretations of any association between a drug class and outcome challenging. To increase the level of evidence and establish a causal relationship between the pharmacological interventions and mortality in TS, more research should be conducted, ideally with patients randomly assigned to a pre‐specified intervention in a randomized controlled trial.

The ongoing BROKEN SWEDEHEART study 40 with a 2 × 2 factorial design will evaluate whether adenosine/dipyridamole and apixaban improve contractile recovery and decrease major adverse cardiovascular events at 30 days.
Even though TS is self‐healing in most cases, it can manifest as life‐threatening heart failure in the worst‐case scenario. Some of the results of our analysis are consistent with previously reported observations, supporting the hypothesis that specific pharmacological treatments may be beneficial while others may be harmful. To clarify this matter, it is necessary to conduct high‐quality randomized controlled trials and observational studies. In the meantime, it is advisable to exercise caution when implementing pharmacological interventions, adhering to the fundamental principle of ‘primum nil nocere’ (first, do no harm).

Cardiovascular diseases remain the most frequent cause of death in adults living in middle- and high-income countries and are associated with a reduction in disability-adjusted life years [ 1 ]. A systematic review from Cochrane suggests that health checks have little or no effect on ischemic heart disease, stroke, and mortality [ 2 ]. The use of imaging to quantify coronary artery calcification (CAC) score is emerging as a new way of identifying patients with increased risk as the images reflect the presence of early disease [ 3 ]. The Danish cardiovascular screening (DANCAVAS) trial is, to our knowledge, the first population-based randomised clinical trial including CAC score in risk stratification. Men aged 65 to 74 years were invited to a comprehensive, advanced cardiovascular screening examination, or usual care. The screening did not result in a decrease in all-cause mortality, although a clinically important benefit could not be ruled out [ 4 ].

In primary prevention, it may no longer be sufficient to focus only on all-cause mortality, as morbidity and treatment costs are increasing. In addition, it is noteworthy that preferences to avoid death compared to avoid nonfatal events appears to be highly age dependent. Individuals below 65 years of age weigh avoiding death highest, while individuals above 65 years of age prioritise avoiding myocardial infarction or stroke higher than death [ 5 ]. Thus, patient preferences are critical important for well-informed shared decision-making.
In the DANCAVAS trial, the primary outcome, all-cause mortality, was defined without involvement from the target group. In this study, we aimed to assess the community interest in cardiovascular screening, user preferred outcomes for such screening, and the effects of screen"

This is a post hoc analysis of the DANCAVAS trial. Here, we evaluate the outcome as defined by the target group. DANCAVAS is a multicentre, parallel-group, unmasked randomised controlled cardiovascular screening trial involving all men 65 to 74 years of age who were living in 15 selected municipalities in the southern and central regions of Denmark [ 6 ]. Written, informed consent was obtained from all participants who attended the screening program. The trial was conducted with the approval by the Southern Denmark Region Committee on Biomedical Research Ethics (ID S-20140028) and the Danish Data Protection Agency.

All men—without exceptions—65 to 74 years of age who were living in 15 selected municipalities in the southern and central regions of Denmark were identified in the Danish Registries and included in DANCAVAS. From September 2014 through September 2017, a computer-based algorithm randomised these men 1:2 to invitation-to-screening (16,736 men, of which 10,471 underwent screening) or usual-care (29,790 men) ( Fig 1 ).

Immediately after the randomisation, participants in the invited-to-screening group were invited to the screening examination by a digital mail in e-Boks, an online mailbox used by Denmark’s municipalities and state authorities. By definition, participants in the invitation-to-screening group became aware of the trial-group assignments, while participants in the usual-care group, including their physicians, were not notified about the trial and thus were unaware of the assignment. Treatment in the usual-care group relies on the individual person, but risk assessment, including measurement of blood pressure, lipids, and HgbA1c, at the primary physician is a free and common service.

The screening examinations were performed at 4 Danish centres from September 2014 through February 2018. The attendance rate to the screening examination was 62.6% (10,471 of 16,736 men participated). The screening program included a non-contrast cardiac-CT scan to detect CAC, aortic and iliac aneurysms and atrial fibrillation; ankle–brachial blood-pressure measurements to detect peripheral artery disease and hypertension; and a blood sample to detect diabetes mellitus and hypercholesterolemia. The screening method and findings has been described previously [ 7 ].
Participants with a CAC score above the median score for sex and age [ 8 ], aneurisms or peripheral artery disease were recommended atorvastatin 40 mg and aspirin 75 mg per day. Additionally, participants with aneurisms were, depe"

The user-defined outcome was determined through a survey to the target group (Fig A in S1 Supplementary Material (Danish) and Fig 2 (English)). Target group included men between 65 and 74 years of age. We identified approx. 10,000 of these men (aiming for 1,000 in each age-group by birth year).

The outcomes were compared for the 2 randomisation groups using Cox hazard regression for analyses of unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) (95% confidence intervals (CIs)).

Randomisation, screening program, and intervention in the DANCAVAS trial
All men—without exceptions—65 to 74 years of age who were living in 15 selected municipalities in the southern and central regions of Denmark were identified in the Danish Registries and included in DANCAVAS. From September 2014 through September 2017, a computer-based"

From September 2014 through September 2017, a computer-based algorithm randomised these men 1:2 to invitation-to-screening (16,736 men, of which 10,471 underwent screening) or usual-care (29,790 men) ( Fig 1 ). The randomisation procedure was stratified according to geographic area. Immediately after the randomisation, participants in the invited-to-screening group were invited to the screening examination by a digital mail in e-Boks, an online mailbox used by Denmark’s municipalities and state authorities. By definition, participants in the invitation-to-screening group became aware of the trial-group assignments, while participants in the usual-care group, including their physicians, were not notified about the trial and thus were unaware of the assignment.

Participants with a CAC score above the median score for sex and age [ 8 ], aneurisms or peripheral artery disease were recommended atorvastatin 40 mg and aspirin 75 mg per day. Additionally, participants with aneurisms were, depending on diameter, referred for surveillance or surgery. Participants with atrial fibrillation were referred for cardiac evaluation; while patients with hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia were referred to the primary physicians.
Survey to the target group
The user-defined outcome was determined through a survey to the target group (Fig A in S1 Supplementary Material (Danish) and Fig 2 (English)). Target group included men between 65 and 74 years of age. We identified approx. 10,000 of these men (aiming "

We identified approx. 10,000 of these men (aiming for 1,000 in each age-group by birth year). The men were randomly selected and not aware of the DANCAVAS trial. The questions were developed together with 8 representatives from the target group. The survey was sent by digital mail (E-boks, see above) in January 2023.
The recipients were asked about their interest in a cardiovascular screening examination. If they reported interest in having a screening examination they were asked, in lay terms, to choose a main reason for their willingness to participate: to prevent stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, aortic rupture/dissection, limb amputation, death due to cardiovascular disease, and/or death due to any cause.

With these answers, the outcome was prespecified in the statistical analysis plan (ISRCTN12157806) before the survey was completed and defined as a composite of reasons chosen by more than 50% of the population. Additionally, if they were not interested in such screening, they were asked why they deselected the screening option.
Outcome
Respondents in the survey defined the user-defined primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were defined by the investigators. In both cases, the outcome was registry-based (Table A in S1 Supplementary Material ). Secondary outcomes were:
Composite outcome of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) (stroke (including ischemic and haemorrhagic), acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and death due to cardiovascular disease),

Composite outcome of major adverse limb events (MALE) (aortic dissection and rupture, revascularisation due to critical limb ischemia, major amputation due to peripheral arterial disease, and death due to cardiovascular disease),
Individual components of the composite secondary outcomes.
Exploratory outcomes were attendance rate, initiation, and adherence to preventive medications and elective aortic aneurysm repair after randomisation.
Safety outcomes were prespecified by the investigators and included potential harms by aspirin (intracranial bleeding and gastrointestinal bleeding leading to hospitalisation) and incident cancer (due to radiation from the cardiac-CT scan) from 6 months after randomisation.

Both relative and absolute risk estimates were reported, as well as the number needed to invite (NNI) in order to prevent one primary outcome after 6 years of follow-up, estimated using Newcombe’s method [ 9 ].
Preventive medications were reported as counts separately for each group and compared between groups by HR (95% CI). Individuals who had received a relevant prescription within 1 year before randomisation were excluded from the analyses.

Thus, based on participation versus non-participation in the invitation-to-screening group, we calculated the probability of participation. This calculation was based on our knowledge of the baseline characteristics of each person in the invitation-to-screening group. Taking selection bias into account, we used the inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) method [ 10 ].

Discussion
We evaluated if the comprehensive cardiovascular screening trial, DANCAVAS, would reduce an outcome defined by the users. The user-defined outcome was established based on patient preferences, determined through a survey to the target group. The intervention led to a reduction in the user-defined composite outcome, stroke, and myocardial infarction.
As DANCAVAS investigators, we defined the primary outcome to be all-cause mortality. However, recognising that the target group may have differing preferences, we conducted a survey to ascertain their preferences. The response rate was 68.0%, with the vast majority expressing a keen interest in the screening examination. Notably, the actual participation rate in the DANCAVAS trial was 62.6%. Therefore, we believe that the interest of the respondents and the underlying reasons are both reliable and relevant. The majority of the target group prioriti"

The majority of the target group prioritised prevention of stroke and myocardial infarction, while a smaller proportion prioritising the prevention of heart failure, aortic dissection/rupture, amputation due to peripheral artery disease, and cardiovascular death. As older patients assign importance to avoiding myocardial infarction or stroke over mortality, these preferences were not unexpected [ 5 ]. Nevertheless, these results emphasise the need of patient (or user) involvement when defining outcomes in clinical trials. While the survey achieved a high response rate, it should be noted that it did not include arguments for and against cardiovascular screening examination. Thus, the answers may differ if potential benefits and harms were described.

The user-defined primary outcome, stroke and myocardial infarction, was reduced with 7% in the intention-to-screen analysis. As we offered a complex intervention, we do not know the effects of the individual interventions. However, in the invited-to-screening group use of antiplatelet and lipid-lowering agents were increased and elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repair were more common, while there was no difference in prescription of anticoagulants, antihypertensive, and antidiabetics. Notably, there were no more revascularisations in the invited-to-screening group. The curves separates after 3 years, thus the effect might be due to increased use of lipid-lowering agents in the invited-to-screening group, as the effect of antiplatelet treatment is not presumed to be delayed.

While the risk of the composite outcome was reduced, we found an increased risk of intracranial bleedings. Opposed to this, there was no differences in severe gastrointestinal bleedings.
These findings are in agreement with recent randomised trials. Prescribing aspirin to middle-aged or elderly persons did not reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, but entailed a higher risk of major haemorrhage among the elderly [ 12 , 13 ]. However, according to US guideline from 2019, aspirin may be considered for primary prevention in patients 40 to 70 years that are at higher risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [ 14 ], while the European guideline from 2021, state that aspirin may be considered in patients with definitive evidence of coronary artery disease on imaging [ 15 ].

Modelling studies from Dallas Heart and Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) suggest that participants with CAC≥100 Hounsfield Units (HU) have favourable risk/benefit ratios for aspirin use [ 16 , 17 ]. The Nice guidelines from 2023 discuss these findings, but due to lack of randomised trials, aspirin is not recommended despite CAC>100 [ 18 ]. In the DANCAVAS trial, we recommended aspirin, if the CAC score was above the median score for sex and age. As the median CAC score in Danish men aged 65 to 74 years is 161 HU, the vast majority of those recommended aspirin had scores above 100 HU [ 7 ]. According to the findings in our trial, treatment with aspirin, in agreement with the Nice guidelines, may not be indicated solely based on presence of CAC.

The main analyses were intention-to-screen; however, non-attendance to screening was more than one out of 3 invited, and this may have attenuated the effect. Due to high likelihood of healthy user selection bias, unadjusted comparison of outcomes among those who actually attended the screening and those randomised to usual-care would be highly inappropriate. Instead, we used the IPTW method. With this method, we balanced all available baseline characteristics (including socioeconomic status) in the invited-to-screening and usual-care groups. As expected, the benefits of the screening examination were amplified. However, this attempted per-protocol analysis should be interpreted with caution, as the model to predict attendance evaluated by ROC curve analysis was poor.

To our knowledge, this is the first population-based, randomised, cardiovascular screening and intervention trial including CAC score in risk stratification. However, there are several limitations. First, when we planned the DANCAVAS trial in 2013, we were unaware of the importance of user involvement. Consequently, the survey, including the user-defined outcome, was not prespecified. It is crucial to note that, by definition, we as investigators did not define the outcome. Additionally, the statistical analysis plan was completed before data collection. Second, a significant limitation is the exclusive inclusion of men in the trial. Nonetheless, we conducted a pilot study involving 1,044 men and 1,016 women aged 65 to 74 years [ "

Nonetheless, we conducted a pilot study involving 1,044 men and 1,016 women aged 65 to 74 years [ 19 ]. Notably, in this pilot study, significant screening findings such as a severely increased CAC score and aortic aneurysms were much lower among women. Consequently, we decided to focus on men, as the purpose was to identify those with severe imaging-based cardiovascular conditions likely to benefit from preventive treatments. Third, we only included men aged 65 to 74 years, and they were mainly Caucasian. Thus, restricting external validity and generalisability. Fourth, the participation rate was relatively poor, and this may have deteriorated the intention-to-screen analyses.

Also, inclusion of men with prior cardiovascular diseases may have impaired the intention-to-screen analyses. Fifth, since the screening and intervention were multifaceted, we are unable to determine which components were beneficial and which were harmful. Sixth, information about outcomes were retrieved from administrative registries, but we consider it unlikely that misclassification of outcomes was dependent on randomisation status.
Based on these results, it seems possible that this comprehensive cardiovascular screening and intervention program would reduce the user-defined outcome, stroke and myocardial infarction, but with an increased risk of intracranial bleedings. Thus, this screening and intervention program is not yet matured to implement to prevent cardiovascular diseases. Future cardiovascular screening programs should encomp"

Discussion
Our study, from a large, prospective, multicenter stroke registry collected over >14 years, demonstrates a marked increase in the recent use of DAPT‐AC beginning in 2013 among >32 000 stroke patients who were non‐eligible for recent DAPT clinical trials. This increase coincided with the "

This increase coincided with the publication of the CHANCE trial, though early arriving, minor stroke patients differed from those in this study. Furthermore, we observed a slight decrease in the annual risk of 3‐month early vascular outcomes, relative risk reduction 2% per year, both in patients treated with DAPT‐AC and patients treated with mono‐ or other dual antiplatelet regimens. The observations that DAPT‐AC is used in ≈70% to 75% of cases in all ischemic stroke subtypes, late‐presenting stroke, or nonminor stroke in actual clinical practice may indicate a significant evidence‐clinical practice gap and highlight the necessity of conducting clinical trials of DAPT‐AC for early secondary prevention in nonminor (NIHSS >4) and nonacute (beyond 24 hours of onset) ischemic stroke patients who were ineligible for recent DA"

As no randomized trials of short‐term DAPT‐AC versus other antiplatelet regimens in ischemic stroke patients with nonminor presenting deficits (NIHSS >4) or late presentation (beyond 24 hours of onset) exist, it remains unclear whether DAPT‐AC is a preferred treatment in this population. Indeed, observational studies from the Korean multicenter stroke registry have suggested that DAPT‐AC was not more effective than aspirin monotherapy in nonminor acute ischemic stroke. 9 , 16 Nonetheless, our study identified a substantial increase in the use of DAPT‐AC, from ≈30% in 2008 to >70% in 2022, among stroke patients who did not meet the eligibility of recent DAPT clinical trials. This rise was temporally driven by the reporting of the CHANCE trial in 2013 and continued, th"

This rise was temporally driven by the reporting of the CHANCE trial in 2013 and continued, though did not accelerate, with the reporting of the POINT trial in 2018.
This study's results in the Korean nationwide stroke registry contrast in several ways with related findings from the US Get With The Guidelines (GWTG)‐Stroke nationwide stroke registry. 8 The GWTG‐Stroke investigation analyzed only data from 2019 to 2020 so it was not able to evaluate trends over time in DAPT‐AC use. Notably, in the comparable 2019 to 2020 time period, the rate of DAPT‐AC use in nonminor ischemic stroke patients was substantially higher in the Korean than in the US registry, 66% to 72% versus 44%. Moreover, the DAPT‐AC use rate in Korea in nonminor stroke patients was also substantially higher than the use rate in the United States in minor ischemic stroke patients (47%). These findings may reflect th"
PMC11179811,PMC11179811_chunk_50,"r, the DAPT‐AC use rate in Korea in nonminor stroke patients was also substantially higher than the use rate in the United States in minor ischemic stroke patients (47%). These findings may reflect that the CHANCE trial, conducted in Asian patients, had a greater impact upon clinicians in Korea, while US physicians awaited the results of the later POINT trial in a Western population and an increase in DAPT‐AC was only just beginning in the 2019 to 2020 timeframe.
The high rate of DAPT‐AC use in patients ineligible for recent trials likely reflects several factors. In the specific conditions of carotid artery stenting or intracranial large artery atherosclerosis, moderately strong indirect evidence supports DAPT‐AC though randomized trials within these populations are lacking. This likely explains the lower rate of DAPT‐AC use in nonstenosis compared with any stenosis patients during the first years of the study period. Also, in the setting of breakthrough strokes despite aspirin monoth"
PMC11179811,PMC11179811_chunk_51,"xplains the lower rate of DAPT‐AC use in nonstenosis compared with any stenosis patients during the first years of the study period. Also, in the setting of breakthrough strokes despite aspirin monotherapy, indirect evidence supports intensifying antithrombotic therapy from aspirin to DAPT‐AC. 17 , 18 These circumstances reflect decision‐making by clinicians based on physiologic reasoning and available data when definitive randomized trial evidence is lacking. 19 These considerations likely also explain the higher DAPT‐AC use rate among patients with higher baseline risk for recurrent stroke, in whom clinicians may perceive more intensive preventive therapy is needed.
Our study also found a yearly 2% relative risk reduction in 3‐month composite vascular outcomes and recurrent stroke, although not statistically significant in the Cox regression analysis. These improvements were observed in both DAPT‐AC treated and other mono‐ or dual antiplatelet treated–patients, suggesting advances in"
PMC11179811,PMC11179811_chunk_52,"ugh not statistically significant in the Cox regression analysis. These improvements were observed in both DAPT‐AC treated and other mono‐ or dual antiplatelet treated–patients, suggesting advances in risk factor management over the study period rather than exclusive reliance on DAPT‐AC. Our results also indicated an increase in annual rates for risk factor control, such as statin and diabetes medication use. Trends in secondary stroke prevention within this population likely involve factors beyond the comparison of DAPT‐AC versus other mono or dual antiplatelet therapy. But the paradoxical ""Will Rogers effect"" may also be contributing and masking an added benefit of DAPT‐AC over other antiplatelet regimens. 20 Migration of higher risk patients from the other antiplatelet regimen group to the DAPT‐AC group would cause the event rate to drop in the other antiplatelet as only lower risk patients remain.
Despite this, in the UD subtype, a significant reduction in 3‐month composite events "
PMC11179811,PMC11179811_chunk_53,"the DAPT‐AC group would cause the event rate to drop in the other antiplatelet as only lower risk patients remain.
Despite this, in the UD subtype, a significant reduction in 3‐month composite events with DAPT‐AC was observed, suggesting a potential benefit of using DAPT‐AC in the noneligibility subgroup, particularly in the UD subgroup, though further study would be warranted. This indicates that the UD subgroup might be a potential target population for future randomized clinical trials for DAPT‐AC.
There were several limitations of the study. First, we lacked information on the duration of DAPT‐AC use and on the use of other medications and risk factor control. However, we considered that the most important results would stem from the short‐term use of poststroke DAPT‐AC in these patients as similar to the POINT/CHANCE population. Thus, we considered the primary outcome of the annual changes of outcome observation as a composite of events within 3 months. Second, despite conducting "
PMC11179811,PMC11179811_chunk_54,"ts as similar to the POINT/CHANCE population. Thus, we considered the primary outcome of the annual changes of outcome observation as a composite of events within 3 months. Second, despite conducting detailed multivariate modeling to evaluate differences in vascular outcomes between DAPT‐AC and other antiplatelet regimens, the retrospective nature of the study made it challenging to avoid unmeasured confounders. Consequently, our findings suggest a potential 15% higher risk of events in the DAPT‐AC group compared with the mono‐ or dual‐antiplatelet group. Third, patients who underwent reperfusion therapy were excluded from the study, even though there might be a potential benefit from using DAPT‐AC after 24 hours of postreperfusion care. However, some of these patients might not use DAPT‐AC due to hemorrhagic transformation or bleeding, which could introduce bias, so they were excluded from this study.

Moreover, our study, focused on DAPT‐AC, has a limitation because we did not collect safety outcomes related to bleeding. Although we collected and analyzed data on hemorrhagic strokes, not analyzing the annual trend of major bleeding constitutes a limitation. Fourth, this study has inherent limitations because it is a registry‐based retrospective study. Additionally, it is limited to the Korean population, and other countries may exhibit different patterns, thus restricting generalization. Moreover, several hospitals have been added to the CRCS‐K registry since 2011, and the impact of these additions cannot be excluded. Although we analyzed the secular trend of outcomes from 2011 onwards by prospectively collecting data, the relatively stable nature of DAPT‐AC between 2008 and 2011 may not have significantly influenced the analysis of the secular trend in outcomes.

Instead, it is noteworthy that this study is the first to analyze time trends and outcomes in large stroke populations not included in recent antiplatelet clinical trials, making the results deserving of attention.
In conclusion, our study, based on a large stroke population from a multicenter stroke registry, demonstrated a marked increase in the use of DAPT‐AC among stroke patients who are ineligible for DAPT clinical trials, coinciding at the time of publication of the CHANCE trial in 2013 and continuing to the present.

PMC11196263,PMC11196263_chunk_1,"Introduction
Platelets play a crucial role in acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and several studies have consistently shown that an enhanced platelet count in patients undergoing an acute coronary event increases the relative risk of death and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), both in the short and in the long term 1 – 3 . Much less clear is the prognostic impact of a reduced platelet count in ACS patients. Thrombocytopenia is conventionally considered a risk factor for bleeding in patients presenting with an ACS treated with antithrombotic therapies 4 , 5 .
Thrombocytopenia develops during hospital stay in a significant fraction of ACS patients, either as a side effect of antithrombotic treatments or due to comorbidities, and its prognostic significance has been assessed in previous studies 6 – 8 . In a subanalysis of the PURSUIT trial, evaluating eptifibatide vs placebo in 10,948 patients with non-ST elevation ACS, thrombocytopenia developed in 70% of enrolled patients and the"

In a subanalysis of the PURSUIT trial, evaluating eptifibatide vs placebo in 10,948 patients with non-ST elevation ACS, thrombocytopenia developed in 70% of enrolled patients and they were more than twice as likely to experience moderate/severe bleeding than patients not developing thrombocytopenia 6 . In a cumulative analysis of 1001 patients enrolled in the TAMI and the Urokinase Trials, thrombocytopenia developed during the hospital stay in 16.4% of patients and these had significantly more hemorrhages than patients without thrombocytopenia 7 . In a post hoc analysis of the OASIS-2 Study, a trial which randomized 10,141 NSTE-ACS patients to i.v. unfractionated heparin or hirudin, patients who developed thrombocytopenia during drug infusion had a more than eight-fold increased incidence of major bleeding 8 .

On the other hand, several large epidemiological studies in the general population have shown that a reduced platelet count is independently associated with increased mortality, including cardiovascular mortality, suggesting that a low platelet count may represent a negative prognostic index among adult subjects 9 – 11 .
However, few studies have assessed the impact of a reduced platelet count at hospital admission in ACS patients on outcomes at follow-up and on antithrombotic treatment decisions.
The aim of our study was to evaluate whether a reduced platelet count at hospital admission has an impact on major adverse outcomes and antithrombotic treatment approach in patients with ACS in a current real-life setting in Italy.

Baseline characteristics
Overall, 1894 patients were enrolled, 1707 (90.1%) had a normal platelet count (> 150 k/µl), 157 (8.3%) a platelet count < 150 > 100 k/µl, 18.4% of whom were females, and 30 (1.6%) < 100 k/µl, 16.7% of whom were females (Table 1 ). Patients with very low platelet count (i.e. < 50 k/µl) were 6 (0.3%) of the total population, 2 (33%) were females. Table 1 Baseline clinical characteristics of the three ACS patient subpopulations.

Discussion
Our data, derived from a real-life registry of patients hospitalized for an ACS in Italy, show that the presence of a reduced platelet count at admission is associated with a worse outcome, with a higher incidence of MACE and NACE, an effect apparently correlated with the degree of thrombocytopenia.
In our ACS population, a mild thrombocytopenia at admission was found in 8.3% of the patients and a moderate thrombocytopenia in 1.6%. Previous studies exploring the impact of the platelet count at admission on outcomes in patients with ACS reported a prevalence of thrombocytopenia ranging from 5.7 to 21.3% 2 , 20 – 24 , in line with our data, showing that thrombocytop"

While emphasis on the risks associated with thrombocytopenia in ACS patients was previously placed on hemorrhagic complications 3 – 6 , our study shows that the main adverse outcome associated with thrombocytopenia is MACE.
Low platelet count identifies a group of ACS patients with increased cardiovascular risk 2 , 25 , and mild degree of thrombocytopenia at hospital admission has been associated with in-hospital cardiovascular complications and with short- and long-term mortality 21 , in particular in patients undergoing PCI 20 .

In a subanalysis of the HORIZONS-AMI Study, baseline thrombocytopenia was found in 4.2% of patients and was associated with a significantly increased MACE at 30 days, with 9.6% of patients experiencing a cardiac event vs 5.2% in those without thrombocytopenia (p < 0.05) 25 . In a retrospective study on 9531 patients admitted to the West China Hospital for a PCI, 9.8% with thrombocytopenia at admission had a significantly higher incidence of primary outcome and target vessel revascularization 26 . In an analysis of patients discharged from Mayo Clinic Arizona, out of 536 patients, 72 (13%) had thrombocytopenia and over a follow-up of 1.1 years they had higher all-cause mortality but not major bleeding events 27 . A metanalysis, including 8 studies and almost 40,000 ACS patients, showed an U-shaped curve for the association of platelet count at admission with MACE, with both reduced and increased platelet counts associating with enhanced MACE 1 .

Thrombocytopenic patients in our cohort had a relatively higher cardiovascular risk profile compared with patients with a normal count. Thrombocytopenic ACS patients, both mild and moderate, were older, more frequently hypertensive and with NVAF or PAD, and had more often suffered a previous MI than ACS patients with a normal platelet count. They also had lower hemoglobin, hematocrit and impaired GFR. The higher risk profile of our cohort of thrombocytopenic patients with ACS led to a worse prognosis, despite clinical presentation was similar to that of patients with a normal platelet count. Moreover, MACE incidence in thrombocytopenic patients (i.e. platelet count < 150 k/µl) was inversely correlated with the platelet count. Indeed, cardiovascular mortality was higher in thrombocytopenic patients (79% and 80% vs 40.2%, p"

Indeed, cardiovascular mortality was higher in thrombocytopenic patients (79% and 80% vs 40.2%, p = 0.025) and MACE-free survival time was significantly shorter in both mild and moderate thrombocytopenic patients, and age at enrollment, previous ischemic stroke, and low GFR predicted MACE at multiple regression analysis in both groups of thrombocytopenic patients. Moreover, in mild but not in moderate thrombocytopenic patients, MACE were also independently associated with a lower ejection fraction and with NVAF, but the difference found between mild and moderate thrombocytopenia can be due to the low number of moderate thrombocytopenic patients in our cohort.

In these HBR patients the 2023 ESC Guidelines for the management of ACS 29 consider the possibility of shortening dual antiplatelet therapy or de-escalating from potent P2Y 12 inhibitors (prasugrel or ticagrelor) to clopidogrel. Evidence from our study points out that patients with a low platelet count have increased MACE risk especially in the first 3–6 months after ACS thus, our data suggest that a default strategy of shortening DAPT or de-escalating from potent P2Y 12 inhibitors to clopidogrel in thrombocytopenic patients should be carefully weighted with the thrombotic risk, especially in those patients with complex PCI (eg. left main bifurcation stenting), while mono-therapy with ticagrelor after 1–3 months of DAPT could be an option in patients wi"

Conclusions
In conclusion, low platelet count identifies a subgroup of ACS patients at significantly increased risk of adverse outcomes. Patients admitted to CCU for ACS with a low platelet count should be treated with special care to prevent excess adverse outcomes. Older patients with ACS and low platelet count are currently treated in a more conservative manner, with less frequent revascularization and lower intensity antiplatelet regimen 29 . Our results suggest however that these patients have a high CV-risk profile (previous AMI in 40% in low platelet count vs 18% normal count) and a higher incidence of MACE. Therefore, in this complex patient population a careful assessment of the individual bleeding and thrombotic risk is highly warranted. It might"

Therefore, in this complex patient population a careful assessment of the individual bleeding and thrombotic risk is highly warranted. It might be suggested that in this specific subset of patients a shorter DAPT duration together with a closer follow-up could also be considered. A strategy of DAPT with Aspirin and Ticagrelor for only one month withholding aspirin subsequently, as used in the Global Leader trial 32 and suggested by ESC 2023 Guidelines 29 , might be envisaged.
Moreover, a stricter glycemic control, lipid-lowering treatment to attain goal LDL-C levels and use of proton pump inhibitors should be adopted 31 .

PMC11268649,PMC11268649_chunk_1,"Introduction
Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of mortality and a major contributor to disability worldwide [ 1 ]. Cardiovascular drugs, including antihypertensive drugs, lipid-lowering drugs, and antithrombotic drugs are the cornerstone for the prevention and treatment of CVD with an established effectiveness in reducing the risk of CVD events and mortality [ 2 – 4 ]. Recent National Prescription Analysis (NPA) in England showed that cardiovascular drugs were the most frequently dispensed medication class, accounting for 29% of all items dispensed in 2022–2023 [ 5 ].
Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) represent a significant barrier in cardiovascular treatment, as they can lead to treatment discontinuation, non-adherence, or the need for additional medications to manage the symptoms [ 6 – 9 ]. Patients on cardiovascular drugs are particularly vulnerable to ADRs as these patients may have an altered metabolism, advanced age, comorbidities, and concomitant medications [ 10 "
PMC11268649,PMC11268649_chunk_2,"ymptoms [ 6 – 9 ]. Patients on cardiovascular drugs are particularly vulnerable to ADRs as these patients may have an altered metabolism, advanced age, comorbidities, and concomitant medications [ 10 ]. Cardiovascular drugs were among the most implicated drugs causing ADRs-related hospital admissions, e.g., major bleeding related with antithrombotic drugs and electrolyte imbalance due to antihypertensive drugs [ 11 – 13 ]. ADRs-related to cardiovascular drugs constituted 18.1%-42.9% of all ADRs reported among hospital inpatients [ 14 – 16 ].
In contrast, there is less information on the burden of cardiovascular drug-related ADRs in primary care. Primary care providers act as a gatekeeper and plays a crucial role in early recognition of ADRs to prevent further iatrogenic complications [ 17 ]. A previous study by Tsang et al showed that ADRs consultations occurred in 1.26 per 1000 general practice (GP) consultations in the UK, with cardiovascular drugs were the most drug classes implicat"

A previous study by Tsang et al showed that ADRs consultations occurred in 1.26 per 1000 general practice (GP) consultations in the UK, with cardiovascular drugs were the most drug classes implicated in the ADRs [ 18 ]. However, this study only captured one year data in 2007. A single practice-based study in Scotland showed that ADRs consultations constituted 1.7% of total GP consultations, with antihypertensive drugs were among the most frequently implicated medication [ 19 ]. There is a need to improve understanding on the burden of cardiovascular drugs-related ADRs consultations in the primary care setting as routine patient monitoring for CVD-related condition, such as hypertension and dyslipidaemia are largely conducted in this setting [ 20 ]. This understanding would help in prioritising therapeutic areas requiring intervention and may provide the basis for further investigation on the burden of ADRs for patients and the health system.

Data analysis
Patient characteristics were presented as numbers (percentage) for categorical variables and as means (±SD) for continuous variables. Overall crude prevalence was calculated by dividing the number of individuals with a cardiovascular drug-related ADR consultation by the number of patients with a prescription of the cardiovascular drug.

Overall and annual age-standardized prevalence was calculated using direct standardisation method using mid-year UK population estimate for 2019 [ 26 , 27 ]. For annual prevalence, the number of patients with a prescription of cardiovascular drug until 1 July each year was used as a denominator. The prevalence was expressed per 1000 patients. Risk factors of ADRs-related consultations were estimated using logistic regression model, stratified by therapeutic areas, i.e., antihypertensive, lipid-lowering, and antithrombotic drugs. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval were presented. P-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Analyses were performed using SAS 9.4.

Discussion
This study found that the prevalence of consultations related to cardiovascular drugs ADRs in primary care was 10.60 (95% CI. 10.46, 10.75) per 1000 patients. Statins, beta-blockers, ACEIs/ARBs, and aspirin were the most frequently associated drug classes in ADRs. In addition, this study identified several risk factors for ADRs consultations related to different therapeutic classes.
The findings from this study resonate the results from previous studies using similar method [ 17 , 18 , 28 – 32 ]. A previous study in Spain primary care showed that the prevalence of consultations related to cardiovascular drugs ADRs was 10.01 per 1000 persons, relatively similar with our finding [ 30 ]. Eguale et al found that the cardiovascular drugs-related ADRs rate was 19.1 per 1000 person-years [ 29 ]. Focusing "

Eguale et al found that the cardiovascular drugs-related ADRs rate was 19.1 per 1000 person-years [ 29 ]. Focusing on the elderly population, Veehof et al found that the prevalence of antihypertensive-related ADRs in general practice consultations was 11.00 per 1000 persons [ 31 ]. Prompt recognition of ADRs in primary care are of importance to facilitate future treatment decisions and reduce the burden of ADRS for patients [ 17 , 33 , 34 ].
In this study, the trend of consultations related to cardiovascular drugs ADRs notably increased in 2004 (0.72%, 95% CI. 0.70, 0.74). Implementation of the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QoF) started this particular year, which partly explained the sharp increase in the ADRs consultations. Under this scheme, general practices in the UK have been incentivised for delivering quality care and monitoring, including for patients with cardiovascular medication use [ 35 "

Under this scheme, general practices in the UK have been incentivised for delivering quality care and monitoring, including for patients with cardiovascular medication use [ 35 , 36 ]. The increase in the recording of comorbidities and other clinical domains have also been observed in other therapeutic areas such as diabetes and psychiatric disorders [ 37 , 38 ]. However, the trend decreased in 2010. Previous review on general practitioner’s view on the impact of incentive scheme in improving quality care in the UK showed conflicting results, showing that such scheme may improve patient satisfaction and chronic disease management, but increased pressure for healthcare professionals may hinder its implementation over time [ 39 ].

Altered pharmacokinetics due to physiological changes, comorbidities, and concomitant medication use increase the risk of ADRs among this population [ 40 , 41 ]. However, this study found that patients aged ≥ 80 years had slightly lower occurrence of ADRs, indicating ‘depletion of susceptible phenomenon’, i.e., the modification ADRs risk in certain population due to several factors, including the past ADRs events and the use of low dose of medication due to age-related conditions [ 42 ].
In this study, statins, beta-blockers, ACEIs/ARBs, and aspirin were the most frequently implicated medication classes in the ADRs consultations, comparable with previous reports using UK general practice research databases [ 18 , 32 ]. Statins and ACEIs are among the most dispensed medications in England, indicating the high importance of monitoring the safety of these medications [ 5 ]. Altho"

Statins and ACEIs are among the most dispensed medications in England, indicating the high importance of monitoring the safety of these medications [ 5 ]. Although generally well tolerated, muscle symptoms may occur in a subset of statin users, particularly in those using high intensity regimen [ 43 , 44 ]. The comparative safety profile between lipophilic and hydrophilic statins has been frequently discussed [ 45 – 47 ]. Muscle symptoms have been reported with all statins, but hydrophilic statins, e.g., rosuvastatin, pravastatin, were considered to have a lower risk of myotoxicity due to reduced non-selective diffusion into extrahepatic tissues, such as muscle cells, while lipophilic statin, e.g., simvastatin, had a higher risk of muscle symptoms [ 48 ]. Nevertheless, it is important to consider dose-response relationship and lipid goal attainment when selecting alternate statin for those intolerance to a specific statin [ 49 ].

The second most involved drug in the ADRs consultations was beta-blockers. Beta-blockers are a vital component for the treatment of heart failure and myocardial infarction. Beta-blockers have no longer been the first-line choice for antihypertensive treatment due to inferior cardiovascular protection, particularly against stroke compared to RAAS inhibitors and CCBs [ 50 ]. Lack of efficacy of beta-blockers in uncomplicated hypertension is attributed to their poor tolerability resulting from various ADRs, such as respiratory symptoms, lethargy, erectile dysfunction, sleep disturbance, blurring of vision, and Raynaud’s phenomenon [ 51 ]. A previous trial showed that the number of patients who discontinued beta-blocker due to severe ADRs was double that of diuretic users [ 52 ]. Cardio-selective beta-blocker"

A previous trial showed that the number of patients who discontinued beta-blocker due to severe ADRs was double that of diuretic users [ 52 ]. Cardio-selective beta-blockers, e.g., bisoprolol and atenolol, are increasingly used due to lower risk of adverse respiratory effect than non-selective beta-blocker [ 53 ]. Given its benefit for several conditions, such as heart failure, cardiac arryhtmias; cardio-selective beta-blockers should not be withheld from patients with mild to moderate reactive airway disease [ 54 ]. Due to their permeability to cross blood brain barriers, beta-blockers may also causes psychiatric symptoms [ 55 , 56 ], thus this medication class should be used carefully in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders [ 57 ].

PMC11268649,PMC11268649_chunk_28,"EIs and ARBs, first line hypertension treatment, were the third most common implicated drug classes in the ADRs consultations in primary care. Persistent dry cough, gastrointestinal symptoms, hyperkalaemia, hypotension, and dizziness are common ADRs associated with ACEIs/ARBs [ 58 – 60 ]. A previous review showed that ARBs had better tolerability than ACEIs, with 28% lower risk of drug discontinuation due to ADRs [ 61 ]. Similar finding was observed in a recent multinational network cohort study which showed significantly lower risk of angioedema, cough, pancreatitis, and gastrointestinal bleeding among ARBs users, with comparable long-term cardiovascular protection with the former [ 62 ]. As generic medications for both classes are currently available, the cost may no longer pose a barrier for initial treatment selection [ 63 ].

Nevertheless, clinical guideline suggested that ARBs should be reserved for individuals who are intolerant to ACEIs, as the evidence supporting the effectiveness of ACEIs is more robust [ 22 ]. Benefit-risk analysis based on individual circumstances should be carefully performed to ensure that hypertension treatment goals can be achieved safely.
The previous history of an established CVD, advanced age, and comorbidities, e.g., diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, consistently appeared as the strongest risk factors for cardiovascular drug-related ADRs consultations. Clinical guidelines generally recommend increased dose/intensity regimen for CVD secondary prevention treatment, which may be associated with more safety events [ 64 , 65 ]. The presence of comorbidities was also associated with higher number of medications, potentially leading to more ADRs [ 66 ].

The use of drug safety alerts to assist healthcare providers during prescribing to prevent ADRs was shown to be effective in reducing ADRs in high-risk population [ 67 ]. Nevertheless, a previous review showed that alert fatigue, which refers to clinicians dismissing alerts due to an excessive number of warnings, was prevalent, with 46–96% of drug safety alerts were overridden [ 68 ]. Thus, further refinement may be needed, e.g., by re-evaluating clinically relevant alerts to reduce noise; and improving information content to reduce the burden of workflow disruption to effectively reduce the risk of ADRs for patients [ 68 , 69 ].

Cardiovascular deaths have long been the leading cause of death globally. in 2021, cardiovascular diseases were responsible for an estimated 19.91 million deaths globally. 1 Non-ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) is one of the leading causes of hospitalization in patients with ischemic heart disease and is associated with a high mortality rate. 2 Data from the Beijing region of China showed that the hospitalization rate for NSTEMI per 100,000 population almost tripled from 2007 to 2012 (from 8.1% to 33.5%), with in-hospital mortality rates decreasing from 6.4 to 5.3% for men and from 11.6 to 8.7% for women. 3 A recent study showed that the 30-day mortality rate for NSTEMI in China was reported to be 4.7%, with the highest proportion of in-hospital deaths. 4 Treatment of NSTEMI consists mainly of pharmacologic and invasive therapies. 5 Antiplatelet drug therapy is usually performed in all patients, and the main drugs include aspirin and clopidogrel.

Percutaneous coronary intervention is an effective treatment for NSTEMI in patients with ineffective pharmacologic therapy or at high risk for NSTEMI (eg, intractable angina, heart failure, ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, and new onset of ST-segment depression). 5
Improving the prognosis of patients with NSTEMI and especially reducing in-hospital mortality is a long-term challenge for emergency physicians and cardiologists. Adherence to risk stratification of the disease and individualization of treatment are key to addressing this issue.

Results
A total of 774 eligible patients were enrolled in this study, 734 of them survived to discharge and 40 died during their hospitalization. The baseline characteristics of the included participants are presented in Table 1 . NSTEMI patients who die in-hospital tend to be older, more likely to have comorbid CKD, have lower SBP and DBP, faster pulse rates, and lower LVEF than those who survive to discharge (all P < .05). In terms of laboratory tests, NSTEMI patients who died in-hospital had higher WBC counts, neutrophil counts, D-dimer, LDH, BUN, and creatinine, and lower lymphocyte counts, Hb, ALB, LDL-C, and TC (all P < .05).

Discussion
NSTEMI is a common cardiac emergency with a poor prognosis. However, previous studies on cardiovascular disease risk assessment and prognosis have focused mostly on ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), and NSTEMI has been relatively understudied. Recent epidemiological studies have shown a decreasing trend in the relative incidence of STEMI and a gradual increase in the incidence of NSTEMI. 3 , 12 Conducting relevant research on NSTEMI could help improve prognosis and reduce the economic burden.

Our aim of this study was to provide early risk stratification of the risk of death during hospitalization in patients with NSTEMI in the expectation of individualized therapeutic management to reduce in-hospital mortality.
In this study, the in-hospital mortality rate for non-diabetic patients with NSTEMI was 5.2% (40/774), which is similar to previously published studies (5.3-6.3%). 3 , 13 , 14 We developed a novel nomogram model based on 6 clinical parameters (age, BUN, ALB, TG, D-dimer and Aspirin) for assessing the risk of in-hospital mortality in patients with NSTEMI. The nomogram yielded satisfactory discrimination power, with AUC value of 0.89 (95% CI: 0.84-0.94). The GiViTI calibration plot demonstrated the good calibration of the nomogram and the DCA showed that the nomogram has good practical value.

It is well known that advanced age is both an important risk factor for heart disease and an influential factor in poor prognosis. In this study, we found that advanced age was an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality in patients with NSTEMI.
BUN is a protein metabolic product generated mainly in the liver and excreted through the kidney, and traditionally, the level of serum BUN is an indicator of renal function.
BUN has been shown to be independently associated with prognosis in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). A retrospective analysis of 2995 AMI patients by Horiuchi et al found that a high level of BUN was independently and positively associated with the risk of in-hospital mortality in patients. 15 Another study showed that elevated BUN on admission was an independent predictor of long-term mortality in patients wit"

Several previous studies have shown that low serum ALB is associated with poor in-hospital outcomes and long-term prognosis in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). 17 – 19 Similar results were obtained in the present study, where we found that for every 1 g/L decrease in serum ALB, there was a corresponding 7% increase in the risk of in-hospital death in patients with NSTEMI. This may be related to the fact that ALB is a negative acute phase reactant, whose synthesis decreases and catabolism increases in some cases of inflammation-related diseases such as AMI. 20

A study from China that included 5836 AMI patients identified D-dimer as a strong predictor of in-hospital death, 21 which is consistent with our findings. Interestingly, however, the analysis of another study that included 234 Turkish patients hospitalized with NSTEMI showed that D-dimer had no significant value in predicting the risk of death. 22 We hypothesize that this opposite finding may be due to the small relative sample size of the latter.
The results of existing studies on the effect of serum TG levels on cardiovascular prognosis are inconsistent. In a cohort study of 1836 Japanese patients with CAD undergoing complete revascularisation, Kasai et al found that elevated fasting TG level is associated with increased risk of cardiac death. 23 Similarly, we found that TG was strongly associated with in-hospital death, with a 41% increase in the risk o"

However, other studies have suggested that lower TG on admission is associated with a poorer short- and long-term prognosis in patients with CAD. 24 , 25 High TG level is generally recognized as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, yet it is associated with a poor cardiovascular prognosis, a phenomenon Xia et al refer to as a “TG paradox” and suggest that this may be because high TG levels indicate a better overall nutritional status, and thus a better prognosis for the patient. 26

As shown in Table 1 , in our study, a significantly lower proportion of NSTEMI patients who died in-hospital used aspirin compared to those who survived to discharge (70% vs 96.7%, P < .001). There was no indication in the original study as to why individual patients did not use aspirin, and we speculate that this may be related to the risk of bleeding. Our study showed that aspirin use significantly reduced in-hospital mortality.
In this study, we developed a nomogram model for predicting in-hospital mortality in patients with NSTEMI. The nomogram showed good predictive performance and clinical utility. The predictors in the nomogram are readily available, which greatly extends its applicability and allows physicians to use the model to quickly and accurately determine the risk of in-hospital death in patients with NSTEMI and provide timely treatment to reduce mortality.

Secondly, prospective studies and larger sample sizes are needed to validate the results. Finally, this was a retrospective and observational study and although we performed a multivariate analysis to eliminate confounding factors, there may still be bias due to unknown confounders.
Conclusions
In this study, we developed a nomogram model for predicting in-hospital mortality in patients with NSTEMI based on common clinical indicators. The prediction model was validated to have good discrimination, calibration and clinical utility. The model allows for rapid risk stratification of NSTEMI patients and provides a basis for individualized treatment.

Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is one of the most prevalent asymptomatic premalignant conditions associated with a risk of malignant transformation into multiple myeloma (MM) or other forms of lymphoproliferative disorders [ 1 ]. MGUS diagnosis requires the presence of <3 g/dL of serum M-protein and <10% bone marrow plasma cells, with no evidence of myeloma-related end-organ damage (hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, anemia, or bone lesions) [ 2 ]. MGUS is further classified into three subtypes that include (1) non-IgM MGUS (IgG, IgA, or IgD MGUS), the most common subtype with an increased propensity to progress to MM, solitary plasmacytoma, and AL amyloidosis; (2) IgM MGUS, which accounts for approximately 15% of cases, with an increased propensity to progress to Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, AL amyloidosis, and, rarely, IgM MM; and (3) light-chain MGUS, a subtype in which secreted M-proteins lack the heavy-chain component of immunoglobulin"

The incidence of MGUS increases with age, with a prevalence of 1–2% in adults older than 50 years of age and up to 5.3% in patients older than 70 years of age [ 5 ]. Although it is benign and premalignant, a growing body of evidence has confirmed the association between MGUS and a variety of diseases, including bone disease, renal impairment, autoimmune disorders, neuropathies, secondary immunodeficiencies, and infections [ 6 , 7 ].
Recently, there has been an emerging focus on cardiovascular (CV) outcomes in patients with MGUS, and a new term, “monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined cardiovascular significance”, has been proposed [ 8 ]. The CV mortality rates in MGUS patients are higher compared with other causes "

The CV mortality rates in MGUS patients are higher compared with other causes of mortality [ 9 , 10 ]. Moreover, venous thromboembolism (VTE) and arterial thrombosis have also been reported to be more frequent in MGUS patients [ 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 ]. However, our understanding of the CV risk factors and underlying pathogenesis in MGUS remains largely limited. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain these associations. For example, increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6) and tumor necrosis factor upregulate the transcription of von Willebrand factor and fibrinogen in MGUS patients, which may contribute to the increased risk of arterial thrombosis [ 17 ]. More recently, clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), which may coexist with MGUS, has been implicated in atherosclerotic arterial disease and the production "

More recently, clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), which may coexist with MGUS, has been implicated in atherosclerotic arterial disease and the production of pro-angiogenic cytokines [ 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 ]. Recently, a Danish study investigated the association of MGUS with a spectrum of CV outcomes. MGUS patients had an increased risk of developing a wide range of cardiovascular diseases, including heart failure, ischemic heart disease, valvular disease, conduction abnormalities, VTE, and peripheral arterial disease, even after adjusting for common comorbidities [ 22 ].
There is a paucity of data regarding the inpatient health outcomes of MGUS patients as they are more likely to present in an outpatient setting rather than a hospital, given MGUS’s typical asymptomatic presentation. Only about 0.1–14% of MGUS patients, globally, are admitted to a hospital [ 23 , 24 , 25 ]. Studies that reported on patient outcomes did not extensively evaluate "
PMC11352401,PMC11352401_chunk_5,"s typical asymptomatic presentation. Only about 0.1–14% of MGUS patients, globally, are admitted to a hospital [ 23 , 24 , 25 ]. Studies that reported on patient outcomes did not extensively evaluate cardiovascular outcomes and were primarily conducted to estimate the frequency of MGUS patients being admitted to a hospital. Our current study investigated the association of MGUS with cardiovascular outcomes in a hospital setting.

Patients aged less than 18 years or those with missing data were excluded. Additionally, 4,054,809 patients with concomitant multiple myeloma, smoldering multiple myeloma, B-cell lymphomas, non-Hodgkin lymphomas, amyloidosis, and Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia were excluded.
Comorbidities included hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), smoking, chronic kidney disease (CKD), dialysis dependence, obesity, dyslipidemia, metabolic syndrome, all-cause cancer, aspirin use, antiplatelet use, and oral anticoagulant use.

3. Results
Out of a total of 17,357,556 patients included in this study, 23,435 patients had MGUS (0.1%). MGUS patients were older, predominantly male, smokers, and Caucasian. Additionally, MGUS patients had more DM (39.2% vs. 27.9%), CKD (33.6% vs. 8.6%), dialysis dependence (13.3% vs. 4%), obesity (18% vs. 16.5%), dyslipidemia (39.1% vs. 23.3%), metabolic syndrome (18.9% vs. 10.4%), and cancer (12.9% vs. 8.1%) when compared with non-MGUS patients ( Table 1 ). The cancer subtypes in both cohorts are listed in Supplementary Table S1 and show a similar distribution, apart from prostate and hematologic cancers, which were more prevalent in MGUS patients. Aspirin, antiplatelet, and anticoagulant use were more prevalent in MGUS patients compared with non-MGUS patients. The most prevalent non-cardiovascular comorbidity was DM (39.2%).

We trended the cardiovascular comorbidities and outcomes from 2016 to 2018 ( Figure 1 ). In MGUS patients, there was an increase in the prevalence of heart failure, acute MI, aortic aneurysm, mitral stenosis, conduction disorder, and cor pulmonale rates from 2016 to 2018. There was a decrease in ischemic stroke/TIA, aortic regurgitation, mitral regurgitation, and PVD rates from 2016 to 2018.
After matching the two cohorts for age, gender, and race, our matched model corroborated several of our unmatched findings indicating that MGUS was associated with higher heart failure, atrial fibrillation, VTE, aortic stenosis, mitral regurgitation, conduction disorder, cor pulmonale, and PVD ( Table 3 ).

Finally, sensitivity analysis was performed, which excluded patients with DM, hypertension, prior MI, CKD (stages 3–5), dialysis dependence, obesity, metabolic syndrome, cancer (all-cause), smoking, dyslipidemia, and aspirin, antiplatelet, and oral anticoagulant use ( Table 3 ). In this sub-group population, MGUS was still associated with higher rates of heart failure, atrial fibrillation, VTE, aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, mitral regurgitation, cor pulmonale, and PVD. There were no significant differences in acute MI and ischemic stroke/TIA rates between both groups in this sub-group analysis.

For matched cohorts, MGUS was associated with increased heart failure, atrial fibrillation, VTE, aortic stenosis, mitral regurgitation, conduction disorders, cor pulmonale, and peripheral vascular disease relative to non-MGUS patients. In the analyses, however, MGUS was found to be less associated with acute MI. MGUS patients without significant non-cardiovascular comorbidities showed similar associations.
MGUS patients had a statistically significant increased risk of VTE. Multiple cohort studies have shown a significantly increased risk of VTE in MGUS patients [ 11 , 12 , 14 , 16 , 22 , 27 ]. One study did not show an increased risk of VTE, probably due to the small population size (166 patients) [ 15 ]. Interestingly, the risk of thrombosis varies within various types of MGUS depending on immunoglobulins. One study showed that pati"
PMC11352401,PMC11352401_chunk_17,"VTE, probably due to the small population size (166 patients) [ 15 ]. Interestingly, the risk of thrombosis varies within various types of MGUS depending on immunoglobulins. One study showed that patients with IgM MGUS did not have an increased risk of thrombosis, whereas patients with IgG/IgA MGUS had a four-fold increased risk of venous thrombosis [ 11 ]. On the contrary, in a different study, the risk of thrombosis was found to be lowest in IgG-type MGUS compared with IgM- or IgA-type MGUS [ 28 ]. The mechanism of VTE is, however, not fully understood, and data regarding prothrombotic coagulation abnormalities in plasma cell disorders other than multiple myeloma (MM) are still limited. One single-center study assessed coagulation abnormalities in various types of plasma cell disorders including MGUS. Factor VIII and von Willebrand factor levels were found to be increased among MGUS cases and the increase was similar to that in patients with MM [ 17 ]. Furthermore, there are data to "
PMC11352401,PMC11352401_chunk_18,"ncluding MGUS. Factor VIII and von Willebrand factor levels were found to be increased among MGUS cases and the increase was similar to that in patients with MM [ 17 ]. Furthermore, there are data to suggest an association between hypercoagulation and progressive neoplastic activity, suggesting that VTE could potentially be a marker of progression toward MM among patients with MGUS [ 29 , 30 , 31 ]. Future studies are needed to investigate these associations and the potential implications for VTE prophylaxis in the clinical setting.
Regarding structural heart disease and arrhythmias, our matched analyses demonstrated a statistically significant increase in the risk of heart failure, conduction disorders, atrial fibrillation, and aortic and mitral valvular disease, except mitral stenosis, in MGUS patients. There are limited data evaluating these outcomes in MGUS patients. The association between heart failure and MGUS is variable in the literature, with some studies reporting a correlat"

The association between heart failure and MGUS is variable in the literature, with some studies reporting a correlation, while others indicate none [ 22 , 23 , 32 ]. Some studies have reported cardiac involvement in MGUS secondary to non-amyloidotic monoclonal immunoglobulin light-chain deposits in the myocardium, which can be found in these patients [ 32 , 33 ]. At the cytokine level, proinflammatory cytokines such as osteoprotegerin (OPG) and receptor activator of NF-kB ligand (RANKL) may be involved in cardiac remodeling and the progression of chronic heart failure [ 34 , 35 , 36 ]. These biomarkers also reflect calcification and are strongly associated with valvular disease and atherosclerotic disease formation in general patient populations [ 37 ]. Several studies have reported increased serum levels of OPG and RANKL in MGUS patients too, suggesting that they might play a role in the pathophysiolog"
PMC11352401,PMC11352401_chunk_20,"ormation in general patient populations [ 37 ]. Several studies have reported increased serum levels of OPG and RANKL in MGUS patients too, suggesting that they might play a role in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease in this population [ 37 , 38 ]. A high free light-chain (FLC) ratio, which is also seen in MGUS patients, has been reported to correlate with secondary heart failure and severe cardiac involvement in cardiac amyloidosis patients [ 39 , 40 , 41 ]. In several case reports on a rare type of cardiomyopathy associated with MGUS, treatment with MGUS-directed chemotherapy, such as bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone, led to a recovery of systolic function in patients [ 42 , 43 ]. These findings may be clinically relevant and suggest that patients with heart failure or cor pulmonale should be screened for plasma cell dyscrasias, such as MGUS.

Similarly, they suggest that patients with MGUS should undergo cardiopulmonary testing during follow-up to screen for cardiac involvement using routine cardiac biomarkers, electrocardiograms, and echocardiograms.
Concerning atherosclerotic disease, our univariate analysis found there was a significant increase in PVD and acute MI in the MGUS cohort relative to the non-MGUS cohort in a hospital setting. After we matched our cohorts by age, gender, and race, the acute MI and ischemic stroke/TIA odds were negatively associated with MGUS. However, in the sensitivity analysis that excluded patients with comorbidities, this association lost significance. These findings suggest that in the matched analysis, other comorbidities had a strong positive effect on acute MI and stroke/TIA. This effect likely overshadowed the impact of MGUS, rendering it negatively associated with these outcomes when trying to reach th"

This effect likely overshadowed the impact of MGUS, rendering it negatively associated with these outcomes when trying to reach the linear regression line in the analysis. Previous studies in the literature have reported increased risks of myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke. A Danish study showed an increased risk of acute MI, ischemic stroke, PVD, aortic aneurysms, and aortic dissection [ 22 ]. Another large Swedish retrospective cohort study reported an increased risk of coronary artery disease and ischemic stroke [ 10 ]. The increased risk of atherosclerosis may be linked to clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), which is the presence of an expanded somatic blood cell clone in people who do not have any other hematologic abnormalities [ 18 , 19 ]. Moreover, as mentioned earlier, the upregulation of certain biomarkers like OPG, RANKL, and other inflammatory cytokines like IL-6, as well as im"

Moreover, as mentioned earlier, the upregulation of certain biomarkers like OPG, RANKL, and other inflammatory cytokines like IL-6, as well as immune complex deposition, in MGUS patients may contribute to the accelerated atherosclerosis seen in these patients [ 34 , 35 , 36 ]. Our findings help expand the literature regarding the cardiovascular outcomes of MGUS and highlight variable results in describing the association of MGUS with atherosclerotic outcomes. The exact cause of these contradictory results is not yet clear, and more research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms and pathophysiology.
Our study has several strengths that are worth mentioning.

Second, our analyses utilized a large diverse US population of MGUS patients of over 20,000, which is within a reasonable, accurate, and appropriate estimate of MGUS’s prevalence in the generalized and national population. Third, unlike other studies, which were conducted on more homogenous populations, ours included a wide range of different races in the population, which increases the generalizability of our findings. Finally, our study involved matching baseline characteristics and sensitivity analyses that excluded patients with comorbidities, which strengthens the reliability of our assessments of various cardiovascular outcomes. Our study substantially adds to the literature on cardiovascular comorbidities and outcomes among patients with MGUS by describing cardiovascular outcomes in a hospital setting.

There are several limitations of this study. This study was retrospective in nature, and our results may change over time as more data are collected. The NIS database also utilizes ICD codes for classifying many of our comorbidities, including MGUS, and so these data can be prone to coding errors or underreporting, such as an undiagnosed MGUS [ 44 ]. Undiagnosed rare comorbidities that were excluded, such as amyloidosis or Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia, can affect the results of this study. There is also a lack of detailed clinical data in the NIS database, including information on the subtypes of MGUS and risk stratification (low/intermediate/high risk), which could have affected the outcomes [ 11 , 28 ]. Another limitation is the lack of data regarding the diagnostic workup for patients with MGUS. By definition, MGUS is characterized by <10% bone"
PMC11352401,PMC11352401_chunk_26,"k), which could have affected the outcomes [ 11 , 28 ]. Another limitation is the lack of data regarding the diagnostic workup for patients with MGUS. By definition, MGUS is characterized by <10% bone marrow clonal plasma cells and the absence of lytic lesions in skeletal imaging. However, not all patients suspected of having MGUS undergo bone marrow aspiration and advanced imaging, such as PET/CT scans, as several studies have indicated that approximately 50% of patients diagnosed with MGUS are classified as low-risk, and this workup can be deferred [ 4 ]. This could lead to diagnostic bias, as some of these patients might actually have smoldering myeloma, multiple myeloma, or other lymphoproliferative disorders [ 45 ]. While our study was able to make independent associations between MGUS and cardiovascular outcomes, a causal association between MGUS and cardiovascular outcomes still remains undetermined [ 46 ]. Our study was also prone to selection bias as we focused on inpatient ca"
PMC11352401,PMC11352401_chunk_27,"S and cardiovascular outcomes, a causal association between MGUS and cardiovascular outcomes still remains undetermined [ 46 ]. Our study was also prone to selection bias as we focused on inpatient cardiovascular outcomes, whereas a majority of MGUS studies are conducted in an outpatient setting since MGUS presents asymptomatically and usually does not require hospital admission. However, MGUS in an inpatient setting should not be overlooked as diseases that are commonly managed in an outpatient setting may have improved outcomes after hospitalization [ 47 , 48 ]. Larger and long-term prospective studies with standardized MGUS screening tests, such as iStopMM, are needed in the future to determine whether these associations are real, which will help make formal recommendations about screening and primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in MGUS patients [ 49 ].

5. Conclusions
In conclusion, our study found that patients with MGUS are at an increased risk of a wide spectrum of cardiovascular diseases in a hospital setting. MGUS patients may benefit from cardiovascular screening tools like electrocardiograms and echocardiograms at the hospital as this disease is independently associated with cardiovascular outcomes. Additional studies are needed to corroborate these findings as this will have implications for the monitoring and screening of cardiovascular complications in MGUS patients."
PMC11546885,PMC11546885_chunk_1,"1. Introduction
Despite advancements in therapeutic strategies, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), which encompasses both ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), remains a significant contributor to global morbidity and mortality [ 1 ]. Central to the management of these conditions is percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), typically involving aspirin and an adenosine monophosphate (ADP) P2Y12 receptor antagonist. Although improved treatment strategies for myocardial infarction guided by advanced imaging techniques are enhancing the effectiveness of percutaneous coronary intervention, the inhibition of purinergic receptors on platelets represents a significant advancement in cardiology [ 2 ]. Dual antiplatelet therapy is essential for the long-term successful application of stent implantation during interventional cardiology procedures. The importance of this mechanism is part"
PMC11546885,PMC11546885_chunk_2,"ology [ 2 ]. Dual antiplatelet therapy is essential for the long-term successful application of stent implantation during interventional cardiology procedures. The importance of this mechanism is particularly pronounced in the context of interventions in the prothrombotic environment associated with acute coronary syndrome. However, the selection of P2Y12 inhibitors has been the subject of extensive research and debate [ 3 ]. The TRITON-TIMI 38 study, which evaluated prasugrel, a potent P2Y12 inhibitor, in a predominantly PCI-treated patient population, failed to demonstrate a significant mortality benefit when compared to clopidogrel [ 4 ]. Conversely, the PLATO trial found that ticagrelor significantly reduced mortality in an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) cohort, including those managed medically without PCI [ 5 ]. Adding to the complexity of choice in clinical practice, the ISAR-REACT 5 trial revealed the superiority of prasugrel over ticagrelor in a head-to-head comparison among pa"

Current guidelines reflecting these findings advocate for the use of more potent P2Y12 inhibitors—prasugrel or ticagrelor—especially in patients with high thrombotic risk, whereas clopidogrel is reserved for patients in whom these agents are contraindicated or not available. In addition, current recommendations are permissible for the administration of clopidogrel to patients with high age or bleeding risk (HBR). However, real-world adherence to these recommendations is influenced by multiple factors, including cost, availability, and concerns about increased bleeding risk associated with the use of more potent agents [ 1 , 7 , 8 ].
Clopidogrel remains a key component in DAPT regimens globally, despite a significant decline in its use in the United States in "

Clopidogrel remains a key component in DAPT regimens globally, despite a significant decline in its use in the United States in the last decade, where its use has decreased from 87.4% to 28.4%. In contrast, clopidogrel-based DAPT maintains a notable presence. Data from the SCAAR registry revealed that clopidogrel is used in 41% of STEMI cases. This indicates that although its usage patterns may vary, clopidogrel continues to be an integral part of DAPT in many regions globally [ 9 , 10 ].
Consequently, in Hungary, as in many other countries, the adoption of potent P2Y12 inhibitors has been gradual, partially because of these considerations. Considering these dynamics, this study examined the clinical outcomes associated with the use of potent P2Y12 inhibitors versus clopidogrel in a contemporary cohort of patients with AMI.

Baseline characteristics were summarized using descriptive statistics. Continuous variables are expressed as means with standard deviations (SD) or medians with interquartile ranges (IQR), depending on the normality of the data distribution, whereas categorical variables are presented as frequencies and percentages. Mortality and major adverse events were compared between patients treated with clopidogrel or potent P2Y12-based DAPT using Kaplan–Meier and Cox proportional risk model analyses.

Kaplan–Meier survival curves were generated to illustrate the time-to-event analysis stratified by DAPT type. The log-rank test was used to assess the difference in survival curves. To account for potential confounders and balance potential biases in observational data, propensity score (PS) analysis was performed. A logistic regression model was used to calculate the PS, i.e., the probability of receiving treatment (potent P2Y12 inhibitors), given the covariates listed in Table 1 . The covariates included demographic information, vital signs, clinical characteristics, past medical history, and procedures.
After calculating the PS, the inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was applied using these scores as balancing weights, ensuring that the distribution of observed baseline covariates was independent of treatment assignment. Weighted Cox proportional hazards models were"

Weighted Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the association between treatment and the endpoints. The absolute risk reduction at 1 year (ARR) was used to calculate the number required to prevent an extra adverse event (NNT).
Our study conducted a comprehensive subgroup analysis to assess the comparative effectiveness of potent P2Y12 inhibitors and clopidogrel. Patients were categorized into specific subgroups based on a range of clinical and demographic factors. These categories encompassed age, sex, diabetes, history of stroke, renal function (classified as severe, moderate, or absent chronic kidney disease), type of ACS (being either STEMI or NSTEMI), and HBR status. For HBR status, both major criteria (such as oral anticoagulant (OAC) use, severe chronic kidney disease, severe anemia) and minor criteria (age over"

For HBR status, both major criteria (such as oral anticoagulant (OAC) use, severe chronic kidney disease, severe anemia) and minor criteria (age over 75 years, moderate chronic kidney disease, moderate anemia, history of stroke) were identified from the database in line with the Academic Research Consortium (ARC) HBR criteria. Patients meeting at least one major or two minor criteria were classified under high bleeding risk. It is important to note that not all 20 criteria outlined in the ARC HBR definition were identifiable in our database [ 1 , 2 ]. Consequently, subgroup analyses were not conducted for patients not categorized as having an HBR. For each subgroup, Cox proportional hazards models were used to compute the hazard ratios (HRs) for 1-year mortality.

A decision curve analysis (DCA) was conducted to evaluate the clinical utility of potent antiplatelet therapy in reducing mortality and MACE. Cox proportional hazards models were fitted, and the predicted risks were calculated for each patient using these models. We also included age as a continuous variable and examined interaction terms between treatment and age to assess potential modifications in treatment effects. Predicted risks from these models were used to create data frames with binary outcomes and predicted risks.

4. Results
Upon filtering the database records, we identified 65,986 patients who underwent PCI and were administered DAPT in response to an ACS event (the record identification process is depicted in Figure 1 ).
Of these patients, 9014 received potent P2Y12 inhibitor-based dual antiplatelet therapy and 56,074 received clopidogrel-based DAPT. There were notable differences in patient characteristics between the two groups ( Table 1 ).

In the unadjusted analysis, the group receiving potent P2Y12 inhibitors exhibited a significantly lower risk of mortality within the first year after myocardial infarction, with an HR of 0.58 (95% CI: 0.54–0.63), compared to those on clopidogrel. ( Figure 3 ). The absolute risk reduction in the first year was 4.75%, indicating that 21 cases needed to be treated to avoid one death. Annual trends showed that the benefits of potent DAPT remained significant alongside the increasing rate of its use. ( Figure 2 B) This finding was consistent with the IPTW analysis, which also showed a lower risk of mortality with an HR of 0.68 (95% CI: 0.65–0.71) for the potent P2Y12 inhibitor group ( Table 2 ).

Similar trends were observed in the incidence of MACE, which is defined as the composite of cardiovascular mortality, MI, and stroke. In the unadjusted model, the potent P2Y12 inhibitor cohort had a lower risk of MACE, with an HR of 0.66 (95% CI: 0.62–0.7) ( Figure 3 ). The risk reduction at the end of the first year was calculated to be 5.57%, with an NNT of 18 to prevent one adverse event. This trend persisted in the IPTW analysis, with an HR of 0.73 (95% CI: 0.70–0.75) for the potent P2Y12 cohort ( Table 2 ).
Both the unadjusted and IPTW model analyses showed that the potent P2Y12 inhibitor group had a significantly lower risk of both myocardial infarction and stroke compared with the clopidogrel group.

Interestingly, the analysis showed an increased rate of repeat revascularization in the potent P2Y12 group. This reached the level of statistical significance in both analyses because of the increased rate of PCI, whereas the differences in CABG were not significant. The increasing trend of repeat revascularization compared with the lower risk of ischemic events in the potent DAPT group might be explained by the higher rate of procedures with revascularization completion.
Subgroup analyses revealed a generally favorable profile for potent P2Y12 inhibitors over clopidogrel in various patients undergoing PCI for AMI. Notable benefits were observed, particularly in patients with diabetes. The benefits of potent P2Y12 inhibitors varied across age groups.

The treatment effect was consistent between STEMI and NSTEMI patients, with HRs of 0.58 and 0.60, respectively ( Figure 4 ).

In both the unadjusted and IPTW-adjusted models, patients treated with potent P2Y12 inhibitors exhibited a significantly lower risk of myocardial infarction and stroke compared to those receiving clopidogrel.
Upon analyzing the yearly stratified data from 2014 to 2021, a noteworthy observation was the consistently higher survival probability for patients treated with potent P2Y12 inhibitors compared to those receiving clopidogrel. This trend persisted annually, indicating a potentially significant association between potent P2Y12 inhibitor therapy and decreased absolute mortality within the first year after ACS. From 2019 to 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic introduced potential confounding factors affecting healthcare access and patient adherence, and the observed survival benefit persisted [ 16 ].

PMC11546885,PMC11546885_chunk_28,"e COVID-19 pandemic introduced potential confounding factors affecting healthcare access and patient adherence, and the observed survival benefit persisted [ 16 ].
The subgroup analyses of our dataset provide nuanced insights pertinent to the 2023 ESC guidelines for ACS management. This is particularly relevant in the context of clopidogrel use among older patients with ACS and those with HBR. Our data indicate that for patients aged 75–79, the HR for mortality with potent P2Y12 inhibitors versus clopidogrel was 0.82 (95% CI: 0.69–0.96, p = 0.017), and for those aged >80 years, the HR was 0.79 (95% CI: 0.62–0.99, p = 0.044), suggesting significant reductions in mortality risk in both groups. It is noteworthy that the reduction in mortality remained significant even in the oldest age groups, despite the higher baseline mortality rate, which resulted in more avoidable events.

Combined with the DCA results showing that age contributes to risk prediction but does not significantly modify treatment effects, our findings support a uniform approach to antiplatelet therapy across all age groups. This challenges guideline recommendations that favor clopidogrel use in older patients, supporting the broad use of potent antiplatelets to optimize patient outcomes without age-specific adjustments [ 17 , 18 ].
For patients with HBR, the risk reduction implies that potent P2Y12 inhibitors may only provide a slight and statistically non-significant reduction in mortality compared with clopidogrel. This finding supports the guideline’s preference for clopidogrel in patients with HBR given the less clear benefit of potent inhibitors. Conversely, in patients with diabetes, we found that interaction p was highly significant for the diabet"

Conversely, in patients with diabetes, we found that interaction p was highly significant for the diabetes status. This finding in the context of that the HR for mortality with potent P2Y12 inhibitors was 0.45 (95% CI: 0.40–0.50, p < 0.0001), indicating a substantial reduction in mortality risk compared with clopidogrel [ 19 ]. Although the smoker’s paradox and its potential interaction with the P2Y12 inhibitor response in STEMI patients warrant further study [ 20 ], this analysis lacked sufficient data to examine this relationship.
Furthermore, our results showed that patients with a history of stroke had more than twice the mortality rate compared with those without a cerebrovascular accident history. Notably, stroke is a contraindication to prasugrel, and recent stroke within the past six months is a major criterion in the ARC HBR definition [ 21 ]. In patients with a history of stroke, t"

In patients with a history of stroke, the HR was 0.63 (95% CI: 0.47–0.85, p = 0.0020), suggesting that clopidogrel was associated with increased mortality. However, our database lacks complete information to fully implement all ARC HBR criteria, including characteristics other than age, renal function, anemia, and stroke history.
Notably, an increased rate of repeat revascularization was observed in the potent P2Y12 inhibitor group. This increase was primarily attributable to the higher frequency of repeat PCI procedures, whereas the differences in CABG rates did not reach statistical significance. This finding, despite the lower ischemic event rates, may reflect a strategy to ensure complete initial revascularization.

P2Y12 and P2Y1 platelet receptors play critical roles in platelet activation and aggregation, influencing the development of thrombosis and cardiovascular events. The TRITON-TIMI 38 and PLATO trials assessed the efficacy of potent P2Y12 inhibitors in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Additionally, the ISAR REACT-5 trial provided a direct comparison between ticagrelor and prasugrel in patients with ACS undergoing invasive evaluation. Collectively, these studies have demonstrated that potent P2Y12 inhibitors are linked to a reduction in adverse thrombotic outcomes, including cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke. However, it is crucial to note that although the PLATO trial reported a significant mortality benefit, this finding was not observed in patients with ACS treated with prasugrel. Significantly, the TRITON-TIMI 38 trials identified a ‘core population’ in which pra"

Significantly, the TRITON-TIMI 38 trials identified a ‘core population’ in which prasugrel demonstrated no benefit or potential harm. This population includes patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), as well as those aged >75 years or weighing less than 60 kg. Consequently, prasugrel’s labeling incorporates these findings, listing such cases as contraindications or recommending a lower dosage. This restriction may explain the more favorable outcomes observed with prasugrel in real-world applications than in trial settings. The on-label use of prasugrel, adhering to these specific guidelines, may also account for its superior performance in the ISAR-REACT-5 trial [ 22 ]. Notably, the incidence of stroke following coronary intervention was substantially reduced in patients administered potent DAPT, a trend that persisted and even intensified in "

Notably, the incidence of stroke following coronary intervention was substantially reduced in patients administered potent DAPT, a trend that persisted and even intensified in analyses using IPTW. This finding supports the notion that stronger inhibition of platelet aggregation may effectively prevent stroke [ 23 , 24 ].
The cost and reimbursement policies of potent P2Y12 inhibitors significantly influence treatment decision making. The increasing popularity of de-escalation strategies, which involve switching to clopidogrel or P2Y12 monotherapy, also reflects concerns about the cumulative bleeding risk associated with prolonged potent DAPT [ 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 ]. Annual data analysis indicates a rising trend in the use of potent P2Y12 inhibitors, accompanied by sustained improvement in mortality. Despite the demonstrated benefits of potent P2Y12 inhibitors in reducing thrombotic risks among patients with ACS, their uptake in clinical practice has "

Despite the demonstrated benefits of potent P2Y12 inhibitors in reducing thrombotic risks among patients with ACS, their uptake in clinical practice has been gradual. Concerns regarding increased bleeding risks associated with the use of potent P2Y12 inhibitors are at the forefront of clinical decision making, particularly concerning medication choices at the time of hospital discharge. These risks necessitate a careful balance between reducing thrombotic events and avoiding bleeding complications [ 10 ].

Although statistical techniques like propensity score matching and inverse probability weighting were used to adjust for observed baseline differences between groups, residual confounding from unmeasured or inadequately adjusted factors remains a significant concern. Furthermore, the incomplete capture of all ARC high bleeding risk (HBR) criteria within the dataset limits the robustness and generalizability of findings related to this specific high-risk subgroup.

The study period overlapped with the COVID-19 pandemic. Although efforts were made to account for its effects, potential confounding effects on healthcare access, resource allocation, treatment decisions, and patient outcomes cannot be fully excluded. In addition, the current study was limited by the lack of data regarding changes in P2Y12 therapy in-hospital or follow-up. Thus, we were not able to analyze potential treatment escalations (from clopidogrel to potent P2Y12 inhibitors) or de-escalations after the PCIduring hospitalization. This limitation may influence the interpretation of long-term outcomes.

We performed the numerous post-hoc subgroup analyses that raise the risk of spurious findings due to multiple comparisons. Therefore, the results should be interpreted with caution, and further research, ideally a large-scale randomized controlled trial, is needed to validate these findings and draw more definitive conclusions regarding the optimal choice of antiplatelet therapy in this patient population.
7. Conclusions
In summary, our analysis indicated an association between the administration of potent P2Y12 inhibitors and improved survival in the year following ACS treatment, which was consistent across a seven-year period. This trend persisted even during the COVID-19 pandemic, although the precise implications of the pandemic on these outcomes warrant further analyses [ 32 , 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 ].

These findings underscore the potential importance of potent P2Y12 inhibitors in the management of patients with ACS. These findings reflect the importance of personalized medicine and the necessity of considering individual patient characteristics and comorbidities when selecting antiplatelet therapy for ACS management. Notable advantages in patients with diabetes and older age groups support the use of potent P2Y12 inhibitor-based DAPT. However, the decision to employ these agents in patients with HBR should be cautiously made considering individual patient profiles and associated risks. These findings may contribute to the evolving landscape of antiplatelet therapy in ACS management, emphasizing personalized treatment strategies to optimize patient outcomes."

PMC11589165,PMC11589165_chunk_1,"Introduction
The World Health Organization reported that 9 million people died of cardiovascular disease worldwide in 2019, accounting for 16% of the total deaths [ 1 ]. Aside from patients with single‐vessel disease, approximately 40%–65% of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) are diagnosed with multivessel disease (MVD) [ 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ].
Compared to those with single‐vessel disease, patients with MVD have a more severe state of atherosclerosis in the vascular bed and tend to have worse clinical outcomes manifested as a higher cumulative incidence of recurrent atherothrombotic coronary events, revascularization, and adverse mortality [ 5 , 6 , 7 ]. With the increasingly widespread use of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in the treatment of CVD, culprit vessels in MVD patients were effectively treated [ 8 , 9 ].

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and an adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor blocker has been established as a standard therapy to prevent thrombotic arterial vessel occlusion after PCI [ 10 ]. Abundant evidence from clinical trials demonstrated a significant reduction in the risk of major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs) for 1 year with DAPT treatment relative to aspirin monotherapy following drug‐eluting stent (DES) implantation [ 11 , 12 , 13 ]. However, the duration of antithrombotic therapy for patients with MVD after PCI is still controversial.
The previous randomized controlled trial (RCT), PEGASUS‐TIMI 54, showed a dramatic reduction in the risk of MACCEs in patients with prior myocardial infarction (MI) and MVD treated with prolonged DAPT treatment (60 mg and 90 mg ticagrelor twice daily in patients treated with low dose aspirin) [ 14 ]. In consideration of the higher risk of bleeding due to the po"

In consideration of the higher risk of bleeding due to the potent antiplatelet effect of ticagrelor, clopidogrel, another P2Y12 receptor inhibitor, can reduce net adverse clinical and cerebral events (NACCEs) and bleeding events compared with ticagrelor in a real‐world study [ 14 , 15 , 16 ]. Therefore, clopidogrel‐based DAPT is theoretically more suitable for long‐term antiplatelet therapy among patients with MVD following DES implantation.
Given these, we designed the Dual Antiplatelet Therapy in Patients with Coronary Multi‐Vessel Disease (DAPT‐MVD) trial to evaluate whether extending DAPT with clopidogrel and aspirin for 12 months would improve the long‐term prognosis for MVD patients 12 months after DES implantation.

The DAPT‐MVD trial aims to provide novel insights and robust clinical evidence for managing targeted patients. Given the possibility of increased bleeding risk, it is vital to prudently evaluate the preferable effect of prolonged DAPT [ 17 , 18 ]. Hence, for MVD patients at 12 months after DES implantation, it is essential to weigh the beneficial effects of prolonged DAPT treatment against an increased bleeding risk.
Methods
The DAPT‐MVD study (ClinicalTrials. gov unique identifier NCT04624854 ) is a multicenter, open‐label, randomized, controlled trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of prolonged DAPT treatment in MVD patients beyond 12 months after DES implantation.

Moreover, a two‐sided test is set at the 5% significance level, and 80% power is designed to reject the null hypothesis. The enrollment duration is estimated to be 24 months, and the follow‐up time is at least 12 months (with an expected median follow‐up time of 24 months). The enrollment progress in both groups was consistent, and eligible patients will be randomized on a 1:1 basis according to the protocol. Considering a 5% dropout rate and an expected noncompliance (switching groups) rate in those groups will be 3%.

After randomization, participants will receive the assigned experimental drug treatment according to their group and have their treatment adherence and concomitant medication assessed at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of follow‐up. The experimental drug will be discontinued 12 months post‐enrollment. Participants may stop treatment at any time, and the experimental drug will also be discontinued if the researchers believe continued treatment poses potential risks. Then, after discontinuing the experimental drug 12 months post‐enrollment, subjects will continue to complete a 36‐month visit and the study close‐out visit (SVC) (12 months after the enrollment of the last patient). We will follow up on all participants’ potential endpoints and adverse events until death or the end of the follow‐up period.

Sample Size Calculation
Based on data extracted from the PEGASUS‐TIMI 54 study, the expected annual rate of MACCEs is estimated to be 5% in the control arm [ 19 ]. It is anticipated that prolonged DAPT treatment in patients with MVD will reduce the target relative risk by 20% (i.e., the hazard ratio [treatment/control] is equal to 0.8) and the per‐year event rate by approximately 4% for the primary endpoint in those populations [ 20 , 21 ]. Moreover, a two‐sided test is set at the 5% significance level, and 80% power is designed to reject the null hypothesis. The enrollment duration is estimated to be 24 months, and the follow‐up time is at least 12 months (with an expected median follow‐up time of 24 months). The enrollment progress in both groups was consistent, and eligible patients will be randomized on a 1:1 basis according to the protocol.

In the era of PCI with significant progress, the gap in clinical outcomes between PCI and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) has narrowed over time. Accordingly, it is reported that the number of PCIs performed for MVD increased by 56% per year between 2001 and 2006; moreover, the number of CABG surgeries declined by 24% and subsequently fell at an annual rate of 5% [ 23 ].

However, owing to the presence of high plaque load and extensive ischemia risk, a heightened risk of adverse events remains in MVD patients after administration of contemporary treatment therapies, with a 3.1% cumulative risk of all‐cause death, 1.9% cumulative risk of MI and 0.7% cumulative risk of stroke [ 20 ]. Moreover, whether prolonged DAPT based on 12 months of treatment after PCI is beneficial remains debatable. Despite the high prevalence and mortality of MVD, a paucity of evidence‐based medicine evidence exists regarding optimal DAPT management among particular patients.

The study showed that 1 month of dual antiplatelet therapy was non‐inferior to the continuation of treatment for at least two additional months with regard to the occurrence of net adverse clinical events and major adverse cardiac or cerebral events; abbreviated therapy also resulted in a lower incidence of major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding. This suggests that future research should focus on individualized antiplatelet therapy. Few prospective studies are concentrated on antiplatelet therapy after revascularization in MVD patients.

According to the 2020 ESC Guidelines for the Management of Acute Coronary Syndromes in Patients Presenting without Persistent ST‐segment Elevation , it is recommended for patients with non‐ST‐segment elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE‐ACS) to receive DAPT consisting of aspirin and a P2Y12 receptor inhibitor 12 months following PCI unless there are contraindications (I, A) [ 25 ].

The CHARISMA trial tested the effect of clopidogrel versus placebo on an aspirin background among patients with prior myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or symptomatic peripheral arterial disease. During the follow‐up for a median of 27.6 months, patients with clopidogrel plus aspirin benefited significantly from intensifying antiplatelet therapy compared with the controls. Clopidogrel significantly reduced the risk of MACCE (7.3% vs 8.8%, p = 0.01) and did not significantly increase the risk of severe bleeding (1.7% vs. 1.5%, p = 0.50) [ 26 ].

However, the extension of DAPT increased the risk of bleeding, making the clinical decision‐making process on the optimal duration of DAPT more challenging.

Hemophilia is an X-linked recessive disease due to factor VIII gene mutations. Advances in treatment technologies have reduced the risk of massive bleeding and improved the life expectancy of hemophilia patients. 1 Therefore, hemophilia patients develop atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) at similar rates to the general population. 2 However, the incidence of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and the rates of thrombotic cardiovascular mortality among patients with hemophilia are notably lower. This discrepancy is associated with reduced thrombin generation and intrinsic hypocoagulable condition of hemophilia patients. 3 4 ACS resulting from plaque rupture and thrombotic occlusion may rarely be triggered by an overdose of coagulation factor supplement. 5 6 Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for patients with hemophilia carries a higher risk of major bleeding. 1 Some experts suggest invasive coronary procedures in hemophiliacs with ACS, lacking established guide"

A 55-year-old male farmer came to our outpatient clinic presenting resting chest pain for several days. He was a current heavy smoker and a chronic alcoholic for 35 years. He was obese (body weight of 76.1 kg and body mass index of 29.0 kg/m 2 ) and had been taking antihypertensive medications for 5 years. After he was diagnosed with hemophilia A during his military service, he had been receiving subcutaneous injections of coagulation factor VIII (Greenmono™, GC Biopharma, Yongin, Korea).

He used to inject additional dose of coagulation factor when he felt arthralgia at both the destructed knees and ankles, as he believed the pain would be relieved by supplement. A chest X-ray and initial electrocardiogram (ECG) showed no specific abnormalities. An echocardiography revealed normal left ventricular function without regional wall motion abnormalities. The levels of cardiac enzyme and B-type natriuretic peptide were within the normal range. Low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol level was elevated at 133 mg/dL. The level of factor VIII was 16%.
Upon consultation with a hematologist, coronary CT angiography (CCTA) instead of invasive coronary angiography (CAG) was performed to rule out angina.

He was suspected to have intermediate spastic coronary artery disease or reflux esophagitis and was released after a 6-days stay, prescribed statin and pantoprazole, but without any antiplatelet agents. He had been advised against excessive use of the coagulation factor supplement.
Twenty days later, the patient was brought to our emergency room due to severe squeezing chest pain.

Due to the patient’s persistent chest pain despite medical management including nitroglycerin, heparin infusion (loading dose of 5000 IU with maintaining dose of 18 IU/hr) and dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) (aspirin 300 mg, clopidogrel 600 mg) were loaded. The minimally invasive CAG intending PCI was performed after a shared decision-making with the patient. Diagnostic CAG via the right radial artery with 4 French sheaths and Judkin catheters showed more than 80% luminal narrowing at the same segment of RCA seen on the prior CCTA. For revascularization, 5 French sheaths and Judkin right guiding catheters were used. Intravascular ultrasound confirmed 90% area stenosis with thrombotic occlusion ( Fig. 3A and B ).

The informed consent for the case report was received from the guardian and the institute review board approved it (No. 202311015-HE001).
DISCUSSION
With increased life expectancy among hemophilia patients, they exhibit multiple risk factors for ASCVD. 1 PCI with DAPT for hemophilia patients with ACS would increase the bleeding risk and presents a therapeutic dilemma due to the lack of experience and evidence. 8
Our patient presented several risk factors for ASCVD and received an overdose of coagulation factor supplement, resulting in ACS. BMS facilitated a shorter duration of DAPT, and no bleeding or thrombotic complications occurred under clopidogrel monotherapy for the rest of his life.
According to the major consens"

According to the major consensus, invasive interventions and medical therapy in hemophilia patients with ACS should not be deferred, as delayed reperfusion can lead to poor cardiovascular outcomes. 1 7 Although the peak level of clotting factor should be maintained above 80% before PCI, 1 confirming the levels cannot justify delaying interventions for ACS. 8
Following PCI, the proper maintenance of antiplatelet drugs holds significant importance due to stent thrombosis concern. 9 10 Since hemophilia does not involve any platelet abnormalities, DAPT would be utilized without definitive guidance. 8 One month of DAPT was suggested following the placement of BMS, as well as 12 months after implanting a drug-eluting stent (DES). 7 In the DES era, advances in technologies, including very thin-strut, mitigate the duration of "

In conclusion, ASCVD affects hemophilia patients just as it does the general population. It is possible to perform CAG, PCI, and post-procedural management with standards of care while maintaining the usual dose of coagulation factors. Further research to develop specific guidelines concerning PCI in hemophilia patients with ACS would be warranted."

Why carry out this study? Aspirin (ASA) is commonly used for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) prevention, but trends in its use across demographic groups and dosages remain insufficiently explored. What was learned from the study? ASA use significantly increased, with more low-dose use and less high-dose use, rising from 2.9 million to 6.6 million users, particularly among women and African Americans. Despite guidelines advising against ASA for primary prevention in older adults without ASCVD, many patients aged ≥ 70 years continue its use, highlighting the need for better education on guideline adherence. The study emphasizes the importance of ongoing monitoring and education on ASA use, particularly among older adults without ASCVD, to improve outcomes and minimize risks.

Introduction
Atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (ASCVDs) are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the USA, with an estimated 800,000 Americans suffering a myocardial infarction (MI) event annually [ 1 ]. The burden accounts for one in four deaths in the USA, incurring an annual burden of $200 billion on the healthcare system [ 1 , 2 ]. Poorly controlled atherosclerotic risk factors and suboptimal use of preventive therapies continue to be prevalent in those with and without atherosclerotic heart disease [ 3 , 4 ]. Historically, multiple societal guidelines have recommended aspirin (ASA) use for primary and secondary prevention of ASCVD [ 5 – 7 ]. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends low-dose ASA for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in adults aged 40 to 59 years with a 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk, while advising against its use for primary CVD prevention in adults aged 60 years or older [ 7 ].

However, recent studies have raised concerns about the risks of bleeding with ASA use in specific high-risk patient populations, which can outweigh the cardiovascular risk reduction [ 8 , 9 ]. The 2019 ACC/AHA (American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association) guidelines [ 10 ]. The ASPREE trial (Aspirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly) found that ASA use in healthy older adults did not prolong disability-free survival and was associated with a significant risk of major hemorrhage [ 9 ]. Similarly, the ARRIVE trial (Aspirin to Reduce Risk of Initial Vascular Events) showed that ASA did not significantly reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events in patients at moderate risk, but increased the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding [ 11 ]. The ASCEND trial (A Study of Cardiovascular Events in Diab"

The ASCEND trial (A Study of Cardiovascular Events in Diabetes) indicated that while ASA reduced the risk of serious vascular events in patients with diabetes, it also increased the risk of major bleeding [ 8 ]. As a result, there has been an overall shift toward an individualized approach to ASA use for the primary prevention of ASCVD. However, the ideal ASA dose was a topic of clinical debate until recently. The Adaptable trial randomized 15,000 patients to high- vs. low-dose ASA and showed no difference in cardiovascular outcomes between the two doses [ 11 ]. Interestingly, in 2014, the National Cardiovascular Data Registry (NCDR) showed that more than 60% of acute MI survivors were discharged on a high dose of ASA, and after that, it continued indefinitely in most of these patients [ 12 ].

In the context of evolving guidelines and recent data, the trends of ASA utilization among the US adult population remain underexplored. Therefore, we performed a 22-year retrospective cohort study of US adults 40 years or older by utilizing the 2000–2021 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) database to determine the overall pattern and changes in the prevalence of ASA use over time. Our goal is to analyze the overall trend and expenditures of ASA use (both 81 mg and 325 mg) in the USA, considering newer guidelines. Additionally, we aim to examine the prevalence of ASA use across different races, income categories, and age groups. This comprehensive approach will provide a clearer understanding of the current landscape of ASA use and its alignment with recent recommendations.

Methods
We performed a 22-year retrospective longitudinal cohort study of US adults 40 years or older using the January 2000 to December 2021 MEPS database. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality sponsors the MEPS, and it is a nationally representative large-scale survey of noninstitutionalized US civilians, their employers, and medical providers, including pharmacies. It collects data on the specific health services, how frequently they are used, the cost of these services, how they are paid for, and the scope, breadth, and cost of health insurance use. The MEPS currently has three major components: the Household Component (MEPS-HC), the Insurance Component, and the Medical Provider Component (MPC).

The MEPS-HC collects data from a sample of families and individuals in selected communities across the USA, drawn from a nationally representative subsample that participated in the previous year’s National Health Interview Survey conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics. Patients in nursing homes or assisted living facilities were excluded from the survey. Each surveyed household was interviewed over the telephone five times (rounds) over 2 years, providing current and continuous estimates of healthcare expenditures at both the person and household levels. Medical conditions, including ASCVD stratification, were based on the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Ninth (ICD-9), and Tenth (ICD-10) Revision, Clinical Modification (CM) diagnosis (see Supplementary Table S1 ), or self-reported history of diagnosis. The participants with known ASCVD included those with (1) coronary artery disease (CAD) and "

The participants with known ASCVD included those with (1) coronary artery disease (CAD) and (2) stroke and/or peripheral arterial disease. This study used publicly available de-identified data from the MEPS website [ 13 ]. Hence, ethical approval was not obtained.
During the interview, the respondents were asked to supply the name of any prescribed medicine they or family members purchased or otherwise obtained during that round. Over-the-counter purchases were also included since the responses were entered verbatim. With written permission from participants, pharmacies were contacted to obtain a computer-generated profile on the medication name, national drug code, dose, quantity, amount paid, and source of payment for each prescription.

The total dollar amount paid and out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditure were reported for each drug. Expenditures were adjusted to 2021 US dollars using the Consumer Price Index calculator provided by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. Missing data were handled by utilizing the MEPS Pharmacy Component (PC) data to impute information collected from pharmacy providers.

Results
Our study included nearly 53 million weighted US non-institutionalized adults from January 2000 to December 2021. The prevalence of ASA users increased from 2.9 million in 2000–01 to 6.6 million in 2018–19. Table 1 describes the baseline characteristics of our study population by the pooled year groups. The mean age of ASA users remained unchanged throughout the study period (66.5 ± 12.1; p trend = 0.37) whereas the representation of female patients using ASA increased across the study period (36.7% in 2001–02 vs. 49.7% in 2020–21; p trend = 0.02).

There was a steady increase in ASA use among African Americans (13% in 2000–01 to 18.9% in 2018–19; p trend = 0.03), while a decline was noted among White patients (68.4% in 2000–01 to 52.9% in 2018–19; p trend < 0.01). Approximately 50% of our study population was in middle- or high-income groups. The representation of uninsured status amongst ASA users decreased across the study period (4.6% in 2000–01 to 0.7% in 2020–21; p trend < 0.01), while there was no statistically significant difference in the representation of public or private insurance.

While evaluating the predictors of ASA use, we found that female patients had lower odds of ASA use in both cohorts of with and without ASCVD than male patients. Furthermore, residents of Northeastern and Western states had higher odds of using ASA than patients from Southern states. Patients belonging to African American, Hispanic, and Asian/Pacific Islander ethnicity had higher odds of using ASA compared to the White patient population. Among comorbidities, hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia were associated with significantly higher odds of ASA use in both cohorts (Table 2 and Fig. 5 ).

Demographic Shifts
Our study included nearly 53 million weighted US non-institutionalized adults from January 2000 to December 2021. The prevalence of ASA users increased from 2.9 million in 2000–01 to 6.6 million in 2018–19. Table 1 describes the baseline characteristics of our study population by the pooled year groups. The mean age of ASA users remained unchanged throughout the study period (66.5 ± 12.1; p trend = 0.37) whereas the representation of female patients using ASA increased across the study period (36.7% in 2001–02 vs"

There was a steady increase in ASA use among African Americans (13% in 2000–01 to 18.9% in 2018–19; p trend = 0.03), while a decline was noted among White patients (68.4% in 2000–01 to 52.9% in 2018–19; p trend < 0.01). Approximately 50% of our study population was in middle- or high-income groups. The representation of uninsured status amongst ASA users decreased across the study period (4.6% in 2000–01 to 0.7% in 2020–21; p trend < 0.01), while there was no statistically significant difference in the representation of public or private insurance.

Trend in Aspirin Use
There has been an uptrend in overall ASA use in adults > 40 years and a proportion of ASA use in subgroups with or without ASCVD ( p trend < 0.01) (Fig. 1 ). The proportion of ASA use in established patients with ASCVD peaked between 2012 and 2015 and has plateaued since, while ASA use for patients without ASCVD continued to increase steadily through the study period. From 2000 to 2021, the low-dose (81 mg) ASA use increased significantly, while the high-dose (325 mg) ASA use decreased (both p trend < 0.01) (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table S2 ). In the ASCVD cohort, ≥ 70-year-old patients were the most prevalent age group with > 50% using ASA, followed by 50–69 years and 40–49 years age groups (Fig. 3 a and Supplementary Table S3 ). ASA use in patients with ASCVD ≥ 70 years decreased after 2008–09 ( p trend < 0.01).

Expenditure Analysis
The average annual total expenditure on ASA was approximately 60 million US dollars (USD). Out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditures averaged 27.3 million USD per year. Both total and OOP expenditures showed an upward trend, reflecting the growing use and cost of ASA therapy in the USA (Fig. 4 and Table 1 ).

Discussion
Our study highlights significant trends in the use of ASA among US adults over the past two decades, revealing both positive and concerning patterns in its utilization. First, there was an increase in overall ASA use and its expenditure along with the subsets of patients with and without ASCVD. Second, low-dose ASA use increased, while high-dose ASA has steadily declined over the past two decades. Third, the prevalence of ASA use has increased among women, and minority racial and ethnic groups. Last, a significant proportion of patients aged ≥ 70 "

Last, a significant proportion of patients aged ≥ 70 years continue to use ASA in both the with and without ASCVD cohorts.
The overall uptrend in ASA use is likely multifactorial, with possible reasons including the increased awareness regarding ASA use for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Recommendations by multiple professional societies favored ASA use until data from recent randomized control trials (RCTs) demonstrated a higher risk of bleeding. In 2002, the USPSTF recommended that clinicians consider ASA use for primary prevention in certain patients at increased risk of cardiovascular disease [ 14 ]. Later, an update released by USPSTF in 2009 consolidated ASA use in men aged 45–79 and women aged 55–79 at high risk for ASCVD [ 15 ].

The 2016 iteration of the guidelines from USPSTF recommended ASA use for primary prevention in those in the 50- to 59-year-old group and 60- to 69-year-old group with elevated cardiovascular risk [ 16 ]. In 2022, the US Preventive Services Task Force recommended considering low-dose ASA for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults aged 40–59 years with high risk, but advises against it for those aged 60 years or older [ 7 ]. Similarly, the Joint Task Forces of the European Society of Cardiology over the years have suggested ASA use for primary prevention in those at an elevated risk [ 17 , 18 ]. However, the ACC/AHA only published guidelines for secondary prevention of ASCVD in 2001 and 2002, emphasizing the importance of secondary preventative interventions, including pharmacological therapy with antiplatelets [ 19 , 20 ].

We noticed a significant increase in ASA use for ASCVD after the study period 2012–2013. This inflection point noted in 2012–2013 was likely due to the increased use of ASA for both primary and secondary prevention. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services implemented the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program to reduce readmissions with certain medical conditions or procedures, including acute myocardial infarction [ 21 ]. Furthermore, the overall care of patients with AMI has improved over the years, even for metrics not part of quality initiatives. Data from the NCDR–Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention Outcomes Network Registry–Get With The Guidelines registry show that the proportion of patients receiving defect-free care for acute MI significantly increased from 66.0% in 2010 to 77.1% in 2017 [ 22 ]"

The temporal change in the population dynamics could be another contributing factor, as improved survival of patients with ASCVD due to advancement in cardiovascular intervention has created a larger population of older adults eligible for secondary prevention over time. The increased ASA use corresponded with changes in overall expenditure related to ASA during the study period from 2012 to 2017.
The shift toward low-dose ASA use is likely multifactorial and has been reported in prior studies [ 11 ]. Observational studies have suggested that low-dose ASA is equally efficacious for primary and secondary ASCVD prevention, and clinical trials have failed to show the superiority of one approach over the other [ 23 , 24 ].

Following this, the European guidelines only recommend low-dose ASA for secondary prevention [ 5 ]. We observed an uptrend in the use of ASA among female patients and African Americans and, interestingly, a decline among White patients. Current literature suggests that African Americans and women are more likely to receive suboptimal CVD prevention than other groups [ 25 , 26 ]. Our study showed that female patients had lower odds of using ASA for both with and without ASCVD, similar to previously reported findings by Boakye et al. [ 27 ]. Such disparities can be attributed to poor awareness, lower utilization of healthcare services, and societal barriers [ 28 ]. Although it is not possible to discern the appropriateness of ASA use in our study, a cross-sectional study by Luepker et al. showed that inappropriate ASA use was noted in at least one in four adu"

Although it is not possible to discern the appropriateness of ASA use in our study, a cross-sectional study by Luepker et al. showed that inappropriate ASA use was noted in at least one in four adults in the upper midwestern area using ASA without an appropriate indication [ 29 ]. Interestingly, overuse was more common among women in this study. In another study by Bazargan et al. that studied the use of ASA among African Americans, 60% of study participants self-prescribed the medication [ 30 ]. As such, despite the recommendations for the nonuse of ASA for primary prevention by multiple professional medical societies, an upward trend in its use among populations traditionally known to have suboptimal healthcare utilization is a cause for concern. Future studies should identify the reasons for this increased use of ASA and the appropriateness of ASA use among these groups.

The increasing trend of ASA use in patients without ASCVD is a cause for concern. Our findings are consistent with multiple prior studies that have shown the use of low-dose ASA for primary prevention to be prevalent [ 27 , 31 ]. A study by Boakye et al. reported increased ASA use in the USA from 1998 to 2009, followed by a nonsignificant decline from 2011 to 2019 [ 27 ]. A study outside of the USA also reported a doubling of ASA use for primary prevention from 2003 to 2017 [ 32 ]. The findings from studies in the USA contrast with the conclusions of a recent Danish study that reported an overall declining trend in ASA use for primary prevention [ 33 ]. Low-cost, over-the-counter availability, perceptions about the therapeutic benefit, decreased awareness of bleeding risk, and direct-to-consumer advertising of ASA could be a few factors for such widespread medication use and self-medication by pat"

Recently, the results of several trials comparing ASA with placebo for primary prevention of ASCVD in patients with diabetes [ 8 ], patients at moderate cardiovascular disease risk [ 11 ], and elderly patients [ 9 ] have shown limited benefit of ASA for ischemic events while significantly increasing bleeding risk. As such, the most recent ACC/AHA guidelines gave a weak recommendation (class IIb) for ASA use for primary prevention among patients aged 40–70 years while also recommending avoiding routine ASA use among adults over 70 years [ 10 ]. The European guidelines have also recommended a similarly conservative approach [ 35 ].

Despite recent evidence of a lack of significant benefit, a study reported that one in four Americans received ASA for primary prevention without an appropriate indication [ 36 ]. Furthermore, the use of ASA for primary prevention continues to be very common among the > 70 age group, with nearly one in two individuals reporting ASA use [ 37 ]. However, the downtrend in ASA use in the ≥ 70-year age group in the patients without ASCVD cohort is reassuring, given the results of recent RCTs and alignment with societal recommendations. The impact of the change in guidelines and recent trials on ASA use for primary prevention in clinical practice will need to be evaluated. This points toward a need for future monitoring of ASA prescription trends, emphasizing provider and patient education on the appropriate and inappropriate use of ASA for primary and secondary prevention.

Conclusions
In this nationally representative retrospective cohort study of non-institutionalized US adults, the use of low-dose ASA increased, and high-dose ASA decreased substantially over the past two decades along with an increase in its total and out-of-pocket expenditure. We noted that ASA use in patients without ASCVD ≥ 70 years remains high, and this needs to be more aggressively targeted by healthcare practitioners. Further studies are required to monitor future ASA trends, focusing on effective strategies for educating healthcare professionals and patients on the appropriate low-dose ASA use for primary prevention.

Idade avançada, presença de SCA, diabetes mellitus, doença renal crônica, características angiográficas e escore de risco isquêmico elevado (SYNTAX 2, GRACE, TIMI, DAPT) devem ser considerados na avaliação da carga isquêmica. Na avaliação de risco de sangramento, devem ser considerados história de sangramento maior, história de acidente vascular cerebral, anemia, diminuição na contagem de plaquetas, doenças malignas, idade avançada, doença hepática grave em uso de anticoagulantes, e elevado escore de risco de sangramento (ARC-HBR, PRECISE-DAPT). A DAPT é prescrita considerando as recomendações das diretrizes atuais, de modo a equilibrar a carga isquêmica, a qual é um indicador de eficácia, e o risco de sangramento, que é um indicador de segurança.

No estudo CURE, que observou os efeitos da dose de AAS quando usado sozinho ou em combinação com clopidogrel em pacientes com SCA, doses mais altas de AAS (>100mg) levaram a taxas mais altas de sangramento e ausência de eficácia adicional. 10 Na doença cardiovascular aterosclerótica, dados atuais recomendam uma dose diária de AAS entre 75 e 100mg. Na França, em um estudo com 380 pacientes, AAS 75mg e clopidogrel, administrados separadamente ou de maneira combinada, melhoraram a adesão medicamentosa do paciente, mas não foram avaliados em termos de eficácia e segurança. 6 Nosso estudo é o primeiro estudo prospectivo, multicêntrico, observacional a investigar a segurança e a eficácia da combinação de doses fixas de AAS (75mg) e clopidogrel (75mg) nesses pacientes.

Em relação aos desfechos primários, a taxa de internação por causas cardiovasculares incluindo insuficiência cardíaca, infarto agudo do miocárdio, trombose de stent e arritmias como fibrilação atrial ou taquicardia ventricular foi de 7,9%. Cronologicamente, o uso de AAS isolado, seguido de DAPT com AAS e clopidogrel, e finalmente AAS com ticagrelor e/ou prasugrel, inibidores mais potentes do receptor para adenosina difosfato P2Y12, mostrou reduzir o risco de eventos isquêmicos no miocárdio em pacientes com SCA. 2 Estudos prospectivos envolvendo pacientes com SCA ou pacientes submetidos à ICP em que a terapia com clopidogrel foi usada mostrou diferenças em termos de desfechos primários.

PMC11699307,PMC11699307_chunk_1,"Introduction
Although acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally[ 1 ], there is a dearth of epidemiologic data describing ACS burden and outcomes in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) [ 2 ]. Indeed, a recent systematic review found that there were no published studies on ACS in nearly half of the countries in the region [ 3 ]. As the burden of cardiovascular disease in the region continues to rise rapidly [ 4 , 5 , 6 ], more data is needed about the prevalence and care of ACS to inform policy-makers and clinicians as they navigate the epidemiologic transition in SSA.
In Tanzania, we conducted the first surveillance study of ACS in the country and found that the prevalence of ACS was high: 22 % of adults presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) with chest pain or shortness of breath had ACS when screened with electrocardiography (ECG) and troponin testing [ 7 ].

Notably, in this preliminary study, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) was defined by a single abnormally elevated troponin, due to resource limitations and inability to perform serial troponins. This approach likely resulted in the inclusion of patients with chronic kidney disease, heart failure, or other causes of chronic myocardial injury [ 8 ], raising questions about whether some NSTEMI patients may have been misclassified.
Our preliminary studies in Tanzania, similar to others conducted elsewhere in SSA [ 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 ], also identified multiple opportunities for improvement in evidence-based ACS care. Of 152 ACS patients, only 23 % received aspirin in the ED, 43 % had died within 30 days, and only 5 % underwent coronary angiography or percutaneous coronary intervention within the following year [ 7 , 14 , 15 ]. Although ACS remains under-studied in S"

Although ACS remains under-studied in SSA in general, a handful of studies from across the region have also revealed that considerable geographic variability exists and thus, there are opportunities for improvements in ACS care and outcomes [ 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 ]. For example, in recent studies in South Africa, Ivory Coast, and Senegal, thirty-day mortality rates for ACS cases ranged from 2 % to 19 %, considerably lower than the mortality rates observed in Tanzania [ 3 , 16 , 17 ].
In response to these preliminary findings from Tanzania, the clinical team at the study hospital, Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre (KCMC), implemented a number of quality improvement measures in the ED, including [ 1 ]: hiring additional ED physicians with residency training in emergency medicine [ 2 ], conducting ACS training for all clinical"

The aims of this study were[ 1 ] to determine the prevalence of ACS in the KCMC ED using a more rigorous serial troponin testing protocol [ 2 ], to prospectively describe ACS care and outcomes following the implementation of quality improvement measures at KCMC, and[ 3 ] to identify predictors of 30-day mortality among patients with ACS at KCMC. To do so, we conducted a prospective observational study in northern Tanzania.

For study purposes only, ECGs obtained on participants underwent additional external adjudication by physicians who were not part of the clinical team and who were blinded to clinical data (apart from participant age and sex). For study purposes, all ECGs were read by two independent physicians, with residency training in emergency medicine.

In cases of left bundle branch block, the modified Sgarbossa criteria were used [ 24 ]. Agreement among adjudicators regarding the presence of STEMI was excellent (91.2 % agreement); in cases of disagreement, a third physician adjudicator served as the tiebreaker.
The study definition for ACS was taken directly from the Fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction [ 23 ]. Specifically ACS was defined by the presence of STEMI on ECG (as described above) or non-STEMI (NSTEMI), as defined by an abnormally elevated initial troponin T value (>40ng/L, the lower limit of the assay's measuring range, which is >99th percentile upper reference limit, as per manufacturer guidance) with an abnormal three-hour delta troponin.

The threshold of 11 % for an abnormal delta troponin was selected to correspond with the manufacturer-defined coefficient of variation (11 %), suggesting that a delta troponin of 11 % was more than the variation expected based on assay precision.

Final diagnoses from the ED clinical team and serum creatinine level (if obtained under usual care) were also collected directly from the electronic medical record system.

The follow-up questionnaire included questions about symptom status, medication use, follow-up visits, and patient understanding of their diagnosis. In cases where the research team was unable to contact participants via telephone, a research assistant visited the participant's home to administer the follow-up questionnaire in-person.
Patient and public involvement
The study protocol was shared with a local community advisory board prior to study initiation and study results have already been shared with the hospital staff and community advisory board through formal presentations.

For study purposes only, ECGs obtained on participants underwent additional external adjudication by physicians who were not part of the clinical team and who were blinded to clinical data (apart from participant age and sex). For study purposes, all ECGs were read by two independent physicians, with residency training in emergency medicine. Physician adjudicators determined the presence of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) as per the Fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction guidelines [ 23 ]: ≥1 mm of ST-segment elevation in ≥2 contiguous leads, except for leads V2 and V3 where larger age- and sex-based cutoff values were used [ 23 ]. In cases of left bundle branch block, the modified Sgarbossa criteria were used [ 24 ]. Agreement among adjudicators regarding the presence of STEMI was excellent (91.2 % agreement); in cases of di"

Agreement among adjudicators regarding the presence of STEMI was excellent (91.2 % agreement); in cases of disagreement, a third physician adjudicator served as the tiebreaker.
Study definitions
The study definition for ACS was taken directly from the Fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction [ 23 ]. Specifically ACS was defined by the presence of STEMI on ECG (as described above) or non-STEMI (NSTEMI), as defined by an abnormally elevated initial troponin T value (>40ng/L, the lower limit of the assay's measuring range, which is >99th percentile upper reference limit, as per manufacturer guidance) with an abnormal three-hour delta troponin. An abnormal three-hour delta troponin was defined by a delta troponin >11 % of the initial troponin value or an absolute delta troponin >20ng/L. The threshold of 11 % for an abnormal delta troponin was selected to correspond with the manufacturer-d"

The threshold of 11 % for an abnormal delta troponin was selected to correspond with the manufacturer-defined coefficient of variation (11 %), suggesting that a delta troponin of 11 % was more than the variation expected based on assay precision.
Participants’ past medical history, outpatient medication use, substance use, and family history were defined by participant self-report. Physical activity level was categorized in accordance with World Health Organization recommendations [ 25 ]: specifically, an active lifestyle was defined by participant self-report of ≥150 min of moderately vigorous physical activity per week; a sedentary lifestyle was defined by <150 min of moderately vigorous physical activity per week.

Statistical analyses
Continuous variables are presented as means with standard deviations, and categorical variables are presented as proportions. Body mass index was calculated directly by dividing the weight (in kg) by the square of the height (in m). Estimated glomerular filtration rate was calculated from measured serum creatinine using the race-neutral 2021 CKD-EPI equation [ 26 , 27 ]. Self-reported household incomes were converted from Tanzanian shillings to United States Dollars (USD) using the World Bank official exchange rate for 2021 [ 28 ]. Thirty-day mortality rates among participants with and without ACS were compared using Pearson's chi-squared and an odds ratio was calculated directly from a 2 × 2 contingency table.

Fisher's exact test was used when expected cell count was <10. Multivariate generalized linear modeling using the binomial distribution was then performed to identify multivariate predictors of thirty-day mortality. Any baseline characteristic with evidence of potential univariate association ( p < 0.10) with thirty-day mortality was included in the multivariate model. The pool of potential predictor variables was selected from among baseline characteristics with a putative association with thirty-day mortality. A threshold of p < 0.05 was used to define statistical significance. All statistical analyses were performed in the R Suite.

Discussion
This study is among the first to prospectively evaluate ACS burden and outcomes in an ED in SSA. The aims of this study were[ 1 ] to determine the prevalence of ACS in the KCMC ED using a more rigorous serial troponin testing protocol [ 2 ], to prospectively describe ACS care and outcomes following the implementation of quality improvement measures at KCMC, and[ 3 ] to identify predictors of 30-day mortality among patients with ACS at KCMC. In this follow-up study using a more rigorous serial troponin testing protocol, we found a similarly large burden of ACS and observed modest improvements in some care processes and mortali"

In this follow-up study using a more rigorous serial troponin testing protocol, we found a similarly large burden of ACS and observed modest improvements in some care processes and mortality. These findings call attention to the need for additional study of ACS burden elsewhere in SSA as well as the need for more robust interventions to improve ACS care in Tanzania.
With the addition of a serial troponin testing protocol to define ACS, we found a nearly identical proportion of ACS among patients presenting to the ED with chest pain or shortness of breath (22.3 % in 2019[ 7 ] vs 22.7 % in the present study). Although many participants were elderly and reported multiple typical risk factors, it is notable that more than one in five participants with ACS reported no known medical problems. This is likely due in part to the large burden of undiagnosed comorbidities in our setting: recent studies from across SSA suggest that a substantial proportion of patients with hypertension"

This is likely due in part to the large burden of undiagnosed comorbidities in our setting: recent studies from across SSA suggest that a substantial proportion of patients with hypertension, diabetes, and other risk factors in SSA have not been diagnosed due to limited screening [ 29 , 30 ]. This finding underscores the need for ED physicians in Tanzania to maintain a high index of suspicion for ACS, even among patients with no known risk factors. To our knowledge, there have not been other studies conducted elsewhere in SSA in which all ED patients with chest pain or dyspnea are screened for ACS; further research is needed to determine if the burden of ACS among ED patients is similarly large elsewhere in the region. Like other recent studies in Tanzania [ 7 , 19 ], we found that most patients with ACS did not present to the hospital until several days after onset of symptoms.

This may be partly due to low awareness of ACS and its symptoms in the community: recent community-based surveys from northern Tanzania found that few adults knew the symptoms of ACS and few considered chest pain to be a reason to present to the hospital [ 31 , 32 ]. Additional efforts are needed to promote community awareness of ACS and its symptoms in Tanzania.
In our 2019 study of ACS at KCMC, we identified several opportunities for improvement in ACS care: only 23 % were treated with aspirin in the ED and only 9 % received clopidogrel [ 7 ]. After efforts to improve training and awareness among ED staff at KCMC, we observed some improvements in care, with 30 % receiving aspirin and 26 % receiving clopidogrel. Moreover, in 2019, only 3 % of ACS patients at KCMC underwent percutaneous coronary intervention and 43 % had died within 30 days of presentation [ 14 , 15 ]. After our qualit"

Moreover, in 2019, only 3 % of ACS patients at KCMC underwent percutaneous coronary intervention and 43 % had died within 30 days of presentation [ 14 , 15 ]. After our quality improvement initiatives which included direct communication with the country's only interventional cardiology team in Dar es Salaam, we observed modest reduction in all-cause mortality and a modest increase in percutaneous coronary intervention, with 33 % of participants with ACS dying and 9 % undergoing coronary angiography within 30 days. These improvements are encouraging, but additional work is needed to increase uptake of evidence-based ACS treatments, improve access to percutaneous coronary intervention, and reduce mortality. In particular, additional study is needed to understand the reasons for low rates of aspirin administration; aspirin, a World Health Organization ‘Best Buy’ for noncommunicable disease, is widely available in Tanzania and has proven mortality benefit for ACS ["

In the handful of studies examining ED-based ACS care elsewhere in SSA, uptake of evidence-based therapies was higher: for example, in Ethiopia 63 % of patients with ACS received aspirin in the ED [ 9 ]. There are many factors which may contribute to sub-optimal uptake of evidence-based ACS care in Tanzania. Qualitative research from the country has found that provider training, failure to consider the diagnosis of ACS, and complex systems are important barriers to high-quality ACS care in Tanzania [ 20 , 35 ]. Focused efforts to address these and other barriers to evidence-based care that reduces ACS mortality are sorely needed, as the 30-day mortality rate we observed in northern Tanzania is among the highest ever reported globally [ 36 ].

Only one participant with ACS in our study received thrombolytic therapy, likely due in part to delayed patient presentations (as the mean duration of symptoms prior to ED presentation among participants was 3 days). Therefore, community- and systems-based interventions are needed to encourage faster presentation to hospital to increase uptake of time-senstive reperfusion therapies.

Study limitations
This study had several strengths, including uniform screening procedures, adherence to rigorous international guidelines for ACS case definition [ 23 ], and a 100 % follow-up rate for participants with ACS. This study also had several limitations. First, as discussed above, we relied on participant self-report for medical comorbidities, which likely led to underestimation of the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors among our participants. Secondly, because a substantial proportion of participants did not present to the ED for several days after onset of symptoms, our approach may have failed to detect some subacute ACS cases if their troponin levels and ECG tracings no longer met the study definition for ACS. This may have resulted in an underestimation of the ACS burden in our study.

Thirdly, although we used standard criteria for our ACS study definition, there are other conditions, such as myocarditis, Takotsubo's syndrome, and pulmonary embolism, which may result in similar ECG and troponin results [ 23 ]. This may have resulted in an overestimation of the ACS burden in our study. Although not possible in our study, coronary angiography, echocardiography, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, would have helped us distinguish occlusive ACS and Type I NSTEMI from other conditions. Finally, we only collected data on all-cause mortality, so it is unknown whether ACS was the direct or indirect cause of death among our participants with ACS.

PMC11739146,PMC11739146_chunk_1,"1 Introduction
Urothelial carcinomas of the bladder are among the fourth most prevalent malignancies among male worldwide, accounting for an estimated 6% of newly diagnosed cancers and 4% of cancer-related mortality ( Siegel et al., 2024 ). Despite the fact that approximately 70%–75% of bladder cancers manifest as non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) ( Lopez-Beltran et al., 2024 ), radical cystectomy constitutes the standard therapeutic approach for multiple, high-grade and/or large-sized NMIBC ( Sim et al., 2019 ; Babjuk et al., 2022 ). Regardless of the standardization of surgical procedures for radical cystectomy and other major surgeries, patients with pre-existing cardiovascular and cerebrovascular conditions remain at considerable risk for severe complications, including acute myocardial infarction ( Babjuk et al., 2022 ; Cathomas et al., 2022 ).

Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) remains the gold standard in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) by re-establishing blood flow to the occluded myocardium through techniques ( He et al., 2022 ), including balloon angioplasty and stent implantation ( Jeger et al., 2020 ). The introduction of drug-eluting stents, which release pharmacological agents like sirolimus and paclitaxel via polymer coatings on bare metal stents, has further augmented the efficacy of PCI by mitigating in-stent restenosis and decreasing the necessity for repeat revascularization procedures ( Fu et al., 2020 ; Suna et al., 2018 ; Giustino et al., 2017 ). However, postoperative dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), consisting of oral aspirin and P2Y12 inhibitor, is recommended post-"
PMC11739146,PMC11739146_chunk_3,"rocedures ( Fu et al., 2020 ; Suna et al., 2018 ; Giustino et al., 2017 ). However, postoperative dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), consisting of oral aspirin and P2Y12 inhibitor, is recommended post-PCI to effectively reduce the risk of cardiovascular ischemic events ( Valgimigli et al., 2024 ). But this implement concurrently increases the likelihood of bleeding complications ( Orme et al., 2018 ). The implementation of drug-coated balloons has been shown to potentially reduce the incidence of late stent thrombosis ( Secemsky et al., 2019 ), underscoring the critical necessity for a balanced approach in antithrombotic therapy to effectively prevent both thrombotic and hemorrhagic events.
Contemporary guidelines advise urologists to discontinue anticoagulation therapy during the perioperative period to mitigate the risk of significant intraoperative or postoperative hemorrhage ( Albisinni et al., 2022 ). However, this strategy may increase the likelihood of intraoperative or postopera"

However, this strategy may increase the likelihood of intraoperative or postoperative thrombosis, especially in patients with malignancies who also have concomitant cardiovascular or cerebrovascular conditions ( Friedrich et al., 2019 ). Furthermore, patients with malignancies frequently exhibit a hypercoagulable state ( Debergh et al., 2010 ). Researchers indicate that maintaining antithrombotic therapy does not significantly elevate intraoperative blood loss. And it cannot increase perioperative and postoperative transfusion and complication rates ( Furrer et al., 2022 ; Wessels et al., 2019 ). Consequently, it is crucial to meticulously select an antithrombotic therapy strategy tailored to patients with malignancies during the perioperative period.
The rate of perioperative acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in urological surgeries is 0.36% ( Jiang D. D. et al., 2021"
PMC11739146,PMC11739146_chunk_5,"strategy tailored to patients with malignancies during the perioperative period.
The rate of perioperative acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in urological surgeries is 0.36% ( Jiang D. D. et al., 2021 ) and the in-hospital mortality rates of this condition have reached up to 15.2% ( Devereaux et al., 2011 ). Therefore, it is crucial to receive treatment immediately in case of a perioperative thrombotic event. The application of PCI in conjunction with continued DAPT is fraught with challenges largely due to the risk of possible postoperative hemorrhage.
In this study, we described a 64-year-old male patient with multiple high-grade urothelial carcinomas of the bladder who experienced an acute STEMI on the first postoperative day subsequent to laparoscopic radical cystectomy. The patient was administered antithrombotic therapy, which included PCI and dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and ticagrelor.

Throughout the treatment, the patient maintained stable routine blood and coagulation indices, with no occurrence of hemorrhage or anastomotic leakage. The objective of this study was to furnish clinicians with critical insights for managing similar patients with acute myocardial infarction during the perioperative period.

Following a multidisciplinary team (MDT) discussion encompassing urology, cardiology, anesthesiology, and intensive care specialists, the patient underwent a laparoscopic radical cystectomy with Bricker conduit urinary diversion on 17 September 2021. The surgical procedure was executed without complications through maintaining stable intraoperative vital signs and minimal blood loss (100 mL). Postoperative pathological analysis confirmed the presence of high-grade urothelial carcinomas measuring 4 × 0.5 cm, with invasion into the lamina propria (T1N0M0, G3) ( Figures 1H, I ).

Given the recent major surgical intervention, the treatment strategy necessitated meticulous balancing of the bleeding risk against the imperative for prompt revascularization. The therapeutic regimen included a subcutaneous injection of 40 mg low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) comprising 30 mg oral aspirin and 180 mg ticagrelor. Furthermore, 20 mg norepinephrine was administered intravenously to sustain adequate blood pressure.

Emergency coronary angiography (CAG) identified significant stenosis ranging from 70% to 90% in the LM, LAD, and LCx arteries, with approximately 90% stenosis observed in the distal RCA ( Figures 2B–D ). The patient subsequently underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), which included drug-coated balloon angioplasty and the deployment of a 3.0 × 23 mm drug-eluting stent extending from the LM to the LAD ( Figure 2E ). Post-procedural CAG confirmed the successful resolution of the stenosis, achieving a Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow grade of 3 ( Figure 2F ). Following PCI, the patient’s myoglobin levels decreased to 1,222.00 ng/mL (normal reference range 28–72 ng/mL) ( Figure 2G ), and D-dimer levels reduced to 1.06 mg/L (normal reference range 0–0.55 mg/L) ( Figure 2H ).

Fortunately, the daily pelvic fluid drainage was limited to 300 mL ( Figure 2I ), and all routine blood indices remained within normal ranges ( Figure 2J ). The combination of antithrombotic therapy and PCI did not result in active bleeding at the surgical site on postoperative day 1 (POD1). The patient’s DAPT regimen was maintained as 30 mg of oral aspirin and 180 mg of ticagrelor for approximately 1 month.

The daily volume of pelvic fluid drainage remained below 100 mL ( Figure 2I ), and routine blood indices remained stable over the subsequent 4 days ( Figure 2J ). These observations suggest that the combination of aspirin, ticagrelor, tirofiban, and PCI therapy did not induce active bleeding at the surgical site. Therefore, the pelvic drain was removed on 23 September 2021 (postoperative day 6) as the daily pelvic fluid drainage had decreased to 30 mL ( Figure 2I ).

However, an increase in D-dimer levels to 4.23 mg/L ( Figure 2H ) prompted a CAG on postoperative day 11.

Intraoperative CAG confirmed the resolution of stenosis in the RCA, achieving Thrombolysis in TIMI flow grade 3 ( Figure 3D ). Post-PCI, a total of 12.5 mg of tirofiban was administered intravenously.
Throughout the hospitalization period following both PCI procedures and antithrombotic therapy, routine blood and coagulation indices remained stable and within normal ranges, negating the need for blood transfusion treatment ( Figures 2H, J ).

Additionally, routine blood indices remained within normal ranges throughout the follow-up period ( Figure 2J ).

However, an increase in D-dimer levels to 4.23 mg/L ( Figure 2H ) prompted a CAG on postoperative day 11. The CAG confirmed patency from the LM to the LAD artery but revealed significant stenosis (50%–70%) in the proximal and middle segments of the LCx and approximately 90% stenosis in the distal RCA ( Figure 3B ). Consequently, an additional PCI was conducted on 28 September 2021 (postoperative day 11), which included percutaneous coronary balloon angioplasty and the deployment of two drug-eluting stents (3.0 × 23 mm and 3.5 × 23 mm) in the RCA ( Figure 3C ).

3 Discussion
This case report underscores a significant challenge in the management of patients with high-risk urothelial carcinomas of the bladder who also present with a history of coronary artery disease. The dilemma revolves around the perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy. Discontinuation of this therapy may mitigate the risk of intraoperative and postoperative hemorrhage. However, it concomitantly elevates the risk of potentially fatal myocardial infarctions. The case illustrates that the implementation of rigorous and standardized laparoscopic radical cystectomy with Bricker conduit urinary diversion, followed by postoperative PCI in conjunction with continued DAPT using ticagrelor and a"

Additionally, personalized management of anticoagulant therapy is also essential for patients undergoing major surgical procedures. In situations where the risk of myocardial infarction is heightened, the careful continuation of dual antiplatelet therapy can be warranted, contingent upon stringent adherence to surgical and monitoring protocols. This finding suggests a potential paradigm shift in the management of antithrombotic therapy for high-risk surgical patients, advocating for a tailored approach rather than the routine discontinuation of such therapy.

Patients undergoing surgery for malignancies frequently exhibit a hypercoagulable state, which heightens their susceptibility to thrombus formation, luminal stenosis, and AMI during the perioperative period ( Friedrich et al., 2019 ; Debergh et al., 2010 ). Research indicates that the incidence of perioperative AMI in urological surgeries is 0.36%, with radical cystectomy representing one of the highest risks for AMI complications ( Jiang Y. et al., 2021 ). Moreover, three-vessel coronary artery disease has been identified as a significant predictor of AMI, particularly in elderly patients over 60 years old ( Han et al., 2022 ; Janardhanan et al., 2006 ). In this instance, a 64-year-old patient was identified with significant luminal stenosis in the LM, LAD, LCx, and RCA through preoperative coronary CTA. Based on these findings, it is recommended that elderly patients with established coronary artery disease undergo coronary CTA before major surgical interventions to identify pot"
PMC11739146,PMC11739146_chunk_38,"erative coronary CTA. Based on these findings, it is recommended that elderly patients with established coronary artery disease undergo coronary CTA before major surgical interventions to identify potential contraindications to minimally invasive procedures.
However, although sensitivity and specificity of coronary CTA have improved to 93% and 92%, respectively, the accuracy of coronary CTA in evaluating the severity of a luminal stenosis is still lower than coronary angiography (CAG) ( Nurmohamed et al., 2024 ; Forrest et al., 2023 ). Therefore, in cases where severe stenosis is detected, CAG should be considered to inform decisions regarding perioperative antithrombotic therapy. What is more severe is that the in-hospital mortality rates of perioperative AMI have reached up to 15.2% ( Devereaux et al., 2011 ). Therefore, the effective interventions are of vital importance.

In a propensity-matched cohort of 34,650 patients with perioperative AMI, an invasive approach was associated with lower in-hospital mortality than a conservative approach (8.9% vs. 18.1%; p < 0.001), but it was also associated with increased rates of postoperative hemorrhage ( Smilowitz et al., 2017 ). More recently, a Danish cohort found that 38.5% of patients with perioperative AMI underwent CAG ( Korsgaard et al., 2022 ). And in another study of patients diagnosed with perioperative AMI, only 21% underwent CAG in which 37% receiving some form of revascularization like PCI ( Smilowitz et al., 2017 ). Therefore, a case can be made for the adoption of a more aggressive and invasive management approach in patients with perioperative AMI with high-risk features.

Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent implantation has become the most widely used treatment for coronary artery disease ( Suna et al., 2018 ). For patients with non-cardiac surgery after preoperative PCI, previous studies have demonstrated that the rates of myocardial infarction and cardiac death occurring in these patients were 0.65%–8.09% and 0.22%–0.85%, respectively ( Kang et al., 2024 ; Wang et al., 2024 ; Graham et al., 2018 ). These data were well below the in-hospital mortality rates of perioperative AMI. Meanwhile, the rates of major bleeding were only 1.33%–5.83% ( Kang et al., 2024 ; Wang et al., 2024 ; Graham et al., 2018 ). In summary, we recommended that PCI and antiplatelet therapy should be considered to patients with high-risk cardiovascular diseases before limited-stage or elective non-cardiac surgery.

Active surveillance or conservative management can be performed to monitor the progression of primary diseases during the period of DAPT. Discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy has the potential to increase the risk of major perioperative adverse cardiovascular events, with stent thrombosis being the most feared because of its high associated morbidity and mortality ( Wang et al., 2024 ). The discontinuation of aspirin and other antiplatelet agents should be reserved for patients with high bleeding risk and a comparably low ischemic risk, with procedures performed in PCI-capable hospitals so patients can immediately be treated in case of a perioperative thrombotic event ( Halvorsen et al., 2022 ). And antiplatelet therapy was recommended to be resumed in all these patients no later than 48 h after non-cardiac surgery, unless contraindicated ( Angiolillo, 2024 ). For patients who "

And antiplatelet therapy was recommended to be resumed in all these patients no later than 48 h after non-cardiac surgery, unless contraindicated ( Angiolillo, 2024 ). For patients who are at a moderate-to-high risk of cardiovascular events, the continuation of antiplatelet therapy is recommended during the perioperative period ( Wang et al., 2024 ; Douketis et al., 2012 ).
Atherosclerosis in its initial stages is marked by the presence of non-calcified plaques (NCP) and mixed plaques comprising extracellular lipids and fibrous tissue. NCPs are more commonly observed in male smokers and exhibit a higher propensity for rupture and thrombosis, which can precipitate acute coronary syndrome ( Al-Muhaidb et al., 2021 ). Researchers have demonstrated that non-calcified obstructive coronary artery plaques, which are independently positive associated with the duration of smoking, are identified as an independent risk factor for adverse cardiovascular events, including AM), withi"

D. et al., 2021 ; Miller et al., 2023 ). This patient had a prolonged history of smoking, and the preoperative coronary CTA revealed the presence of NCP in the LCx and RCA, thereby categorizing him as high-risk for perioperative AMI. Coronary CTA proves to be a valuable tool for detecting such plaques and assessing the severity of luminal stenosis, which facilitates improved perioperative risk management ( Meah et al., 2022 ).
Previous research has demonstrated that the continuation of antiplatelet therapy with aspirin during the perioperative period of non-cardiac surgery does not significantly elevate the risk of intraoperative blood loss, transfusion rates, or perioperative complications ( Wessels et al., 2019 ; Furrer et al., 2022 ; Albisinni et al., 2022 )"

However, there is a paucity of data regarding the continuous use of DAPT with aspirin in combination with ticagrelor or clopidogrel during this period. In this instance, the patient underwent PCI and was administered DAPT comprising aspirin and ticagrelor within 24 h postoperatively. Despite this intervention, routine blood tests and pelvic drainage metrics remained stable within normal limits throughout the hospitalization period, and no blood transfusion was necessitated. These observations suggest that DAPT can be safely managed in similar clinical scenarios.

Ticagrelor is among the latest antiplatelet agents utilized to inhibit platelet aggregation by blocking the ADP receptors of the P2Y12 subtype ( Kilic et al., 2018 ). Tirofiban, a well-established GPIIb/IIIa receptor antagonist, has demonstrated efficacy in enhancing coronary blood flow and myocardial reperfusion during emergency PCI in patients with STEMI ( Peng and Li, 2022 ). Research indicates that tirofiban effectively inhibits the release of serotonin and thromboxane A2 from platelets, thereby mitigating vasoconstriction and facilitating distal coronary vasodilation. Additionally, tirofiban has been shown to improve vascular endothelial function by augmenting endogenous nitric oxide (NO) levels.

Empirical evidence indicates that the concomitant use of ticagrelor and tirofiban enhances coronary recanalization rates and mitigates the occurrence of no-reflow or slow blood flow during PCI, without a significant increase in adverse reactions ( Li et al., 2022 ; Peng and Li, 2022 ). In this particular case, the patient was administered DAPT comprising ticagrelor and aspirin, in addition to intravenous tirofiban post-PCI, thereby demonstrating the safety and efficacy of this antithrombotic strategy.
For patients experiencing AMI, particularly during the perioperative period, the implementation of appropriate antithrombotic therapy is crucial to mitigate the risk of recurrent thrombotic events. Current guidelines recommend administering potent P2Y12 inhibitors, such as ticagrelor or prasugrel, over clopidogrel for AMI patients post-PCI. This preference is due to their superior efficac"

This preference is due to their superior efficacy in reducing thrombotic risk, particularly during the early stages of acute coronary syndrome ( Casula et al., 2024 ; Morrow et al., 2009 ; Jobs et al., 2024 ). Several randomized trials have demonstrated that potent P2Y12 inhibitors are associated with a higher risk of bleeding compared to clopidogrel ( James et al., 2011 ). However, the majority of bleeding events in acute coronary syndrome occur during the maintenance phase, which is more than 1 month after DAPT and PCI ( Turgeon et al., 2020 ; Andell et al., 2015 ). Consequently, these findings have informed a strategy of tapering the intensity of DAPT over time, wherein potent P2Y12 inhibitors are administered during the acute phase of acute coronary syndrome, and clopidogrel is utilized during the chronic treatment period ( Kim et a"

In a multicenter, non-inferiority randomized trial, for patients with stable acute myocardial infarction who did not experience major ischemic or bleeding events within 1 month post-PCI, switching from ticagrelor to clopidogrel could significantly reduce bleeding risk without increasing the incidence of ischemia or recurrent thrombotic events have been demonstrated ( Turgeon et al., 2020 ). In this particular patient, no hemorrhagic complications were observed with DAPT using ticagrelor and aspirin 1 month following urological surgery and PCI. This observation is consistent with previous studies, thereby supporting the safety of perioperative DAPT.

Subsequently, ticagrelor was transitioned to clopidogrel, based on evidence indicating that this switch mitigates the risk of bleeding without elevating the incidence of ischemic events ( Turgeon et al., 2020 ). This case illustrates that DAPT with ticagrelor and aspirin constitutes a safe and effective antithrombotic regimen for patients during the perioperative period.
A notable limitation of this study was the patient’s refusal to undergo CAG, despite the presence of multiple coronary luminal stenoses identified on coronary CTA. This refusal may have been a contributing factor to the occurrence of perioperative STEMI on postoperative day 1 (POD1). This study underscores the critical importance of performing CAG in patients with significant coronary artery disease prior to major surgery to optimize perioperative management and mitigate the risk of such complications.

For comparison of the impact of aspirin, we also looked at males alone, noting that all females were on aspirin and so it was not possible to analyze this group. In contrast the healthy cohort subjects were all between 20 and 50 years old and are expected not to be post menopausal. Here, separate comparisons between male and female subjects were possible both on and off aspirin supplementation.

Platelets were isolated in an air-conditioned room maintained at a constant temperature of 22°C. They were isolated, activated, and then extracted on the same day, taking care that the same internal standard (IS) batches were used for all samples in each batch. It was essential to process them to extracts on the same day of platelet isolation so that enzymatic reactions were stopped prior to storage. Once they were all prepared, they were stored at −80°C and then analyzed using LC/MS/MS as one large batch. Harmonization material was not used.
Leukocyte isolation
Leukocytes were isolated from 20 ml citrate-anticoagulated whole blood as described ( 8 ).

LC/MS/MS of 12-HETE and TXB2
Platelet lipid extracts from healthy subjects were analyzed for 12-HETE and TXB2 using LC/MS/MS. However, since samples had already been extracted for analysis, this was a post hoc estimate, meaning that IS (5 ng of each of 12S-HETE- d8 and TXB2- d4 (Cayman Chemical)) were added after lipid extraction. Thus, variability in extraction efficiency would not be accounted, and data are expressed as A/IS (area, cps). Also, insufficient volumes of all samples were available due to prior assays, and so only a subset of 14 samples were measured. Samples were processed on a C18 Spherisorb ODS2, 5 μm, 150 × 4.6-mm column (Waters, Hertfordshire, UK) using a gradient of 50%–90% B over 10 min (A, water:acetonitrile:acetic acid, 75:25:0.1; B, MeOH:acetonitrile:acetic"

Statistical analysis
LC/MS/MS data were exported from Analyst v1.6.3 (Sciex) and analyzed using MultiQuant v3.0.3 (Sciex). Statistics and bioinformatics used the coding environment R (Open source, version 3.5.3; www.r-project.org ). For heatmaps, mean values (ng/ml or cell number) were log10 transformed and plotted as intensity values using the Pheatmap package with lipid hierarchical clustering. Each lipid was annotated, using a color code, according to its presumed enzymatic origin ( 42 ).

For paired samples, paired t test was used, where data were determined using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to be normally distributed ( socscistatistics.com ), or Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test where it was not. Basal samples were not included in statistical comparisons of activated samples since eoxPL were rarely detected without activation.

Due to this, in some groups there were insufficient females for statistical analysis. For comparison of the impact of aspirin, we also looked at males alone, noting that all females were on aspirin and so it was not possible to analyze this group. In contrast the healthy cohort subjects were all between 20 and 50 years old and are expected not to be post menopausal. Here, separate comparisons between male and female subjects were possible both on and off aspirin supplementation.
Results
HETE-PL were quantified in platelets from patients with ACS, CAD, and RF basally and then following thrombin activation. The most abundant PE and PC species previously detected in platelets were measured using LC/MS/MS, specifically four PEs and two PCs with 18:0, 18:1, or 16:0, including both plasmalogen and acyl forms.

Five HETE positional isoforms (5-, 8-, 11-, 12-, and 15-) of these were quantified ( 10 ). Little or no HETE-PL were detected basally; however, thrombin stimulated large increases, particularly the abundant 12-HETE-PL species formed via 12-LOX ( 10 ) ( Fig. 1 A). Other HETE-PL also were formed on activation, mainly 15- and 11-HETE-PL but also very low levels of 8-HETE-PL, while 5-HETE-PL were below limit of detection ( Fig. 1 B, C, supplemental Fig. S2 A). Briefly, 12-HETE-PL were formed at significantly higher levels in activated platelets from all patient groups, than HC ( Fig. 1 A). The increase in 12-HETE-PL was due to higher levels of the three diacyl-12-HETE-PL, with no significant differences for plasmalogens ( Fig. 1 D–F, supplemental Fig. S2 B–D).

In contrast, 15- and 11-HETE-PL were significantly reduced in activated platelets from all groups compared to HC ( Fig. 1 B, C). Here, both plasmalogen and acyl-forms of HETE-PEs, and PCs were impacted equally ( supplemental Figs. S2 E–J, S3 A–E). Subsequently, 8-HETE-PL in activated platelets were not different for patient groups versus HC ( supplemental Fig. 2 A). Overall, this indicates that diacyl-eoxPL from 12-LOX are significantly higher in patient groups, while both acyl and plasmalogen 15- and 11-HETE-PL species are reduced.

In platelets, 15- and 11-HETE-PL likely are generated following cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1) formation of 15- and 11-HETE, followed by their esterification into PL. To test this, the effect of aspirin supplementation was determined. All ACS, but no HC participants were taking aspirin ( supplemental Table S8 ). In contrast, in both the RF and CAD groups, a small number were not on aspirin allowing direct comparison within these groups. Although patient numbers in some groups were relatively low, a significant suppressive effect of aspirin on both 11- and 15-HETE-PL generation was clearly observed, while for participants not on aspirin in the HC, RF, and CAD groups, there were no significant differences ( Fig. 1 G–J). Aspirin supplementation was also associated with a significant increase in 12-HETE-PL levels in the RF + CAD groups ( Fig. 1 "
PMC11754521,PMC11754521_chunk_75,", RF, and CAD groups, there were no significant differences ( Fig. 1 G–J). Aspirin supplementation was also associated with a significant increase in 12-HETE-PL levels in the RF + CAD groups ( Fig. 1 K), while for participants not on aspirin, there was no impact of disease ( Fig. 1 L). Next, the individual isoforms of 12-HETE-PL in the RF + CAD groups were measured. In the case of 12-HETE-PL, two of the three diacyl isoforms were significantly increased in platelets by aspirin supplementation, while for all plasmalogens, there was no effect ( supplemental Fig. S3 F). Last, since all female RF and CAD patients were on aspirin, to test the effect of gender, males only were compared. As seen above, aspirin significantly increased platelet generation of diacyl 12-HETE-PL for RF + CAD males ( supplemental Fig. S4 ). In contrast, reductions in 11- and 15-HETE-PL were seen for both acyl and plasmalogen forms in CAD and RF groups, with many PCs in the aspirin groups being below LOQ of our assa"

In contrast, reductions in 11- and 15-HETE-PL were seen for both acyl and plasmalogen forms in CAD and RF groups, with many PCs in the aspirin groups being below LOQ of our assay, and not quantifiable ( supplemental Fig. S5 ). These data indicate that altered platelet eoxPL generation in ASCVD is driven by aspirin. This idea will be further tested in a healthy cohort, later. Using clinical data, eoxPL generation by platelets was also compared to either medication use (anticoagulants, P2Y12 inhibitors, and statins) or other diseases (diabetes, hypertension), but no correlations were noted.
Next, HETE-PL levels were analyzed in leukocyte isolates obtained from patients and healthy control subjects both basally and after ionophore activation, to determine the capacity of the cells to generate them. Generation of eoxPL by ionophore-activated leukocytes was demonstrated, particularly in healthy control samples ( Fig. 2 A). However, levels of eoxPL were lower than in p"

Several HETE-PL formed on activation, mainly 15-, 12-, or 5-HETEs, with 11-HETE-PL being generated at very low levels ( Fig. 2 A, D–F, supplemental Figs. S6 and S7 ). Overall, total 5-HETE-PL (when normalized to leukocyte numbers) generated by 5-LOX showed a small nonsignificant trend to elevate in all groups ( Fig. 2 A, supplemental Fig. 6 A). When cell counts for the patient groups were compared, a significant increase was seen for ACS versus RF for both total white cells and neutrophils ( Fig. 2 B, C). Thus in vivo, the amounts of 5-HETE-PE generated overall may be further elevated due to the higher cell counts. Generation of several 15, 12, or 11-HETE-PL species were significantly decrea"

Generation of several 15, 12, or 11-HETE-PL species were significantly decreased in patient groups, versus HC ( Fig. 2 D–F, supplemental Figs. S6 B, S7 ). We next examined if this finding was associated with drug treatments or coexisting conditions. While there were no significant differences seen for P2Y12 inhibitors (although not many patients were on these drugs), aspirin was associated with a small increase in 15-HETE-PL but no changes for 11-, 12-, or 5-HETE-PEs ( Fig. G, supplemental Fig. S8 A). Last, there were no associations with statins, hypertension or diabetes seen. Fig. 2 12-, 11-, and 15-HETE-PL in ionophore-activated leukocytes are lower in patients with ASCVD than healthy controls.

To further test the impact of aspirin on platelet eoxPL, we turned to a healthy cohort. Previously, in platelets from three unrelated healthy human donors, we found that ∼100 eoxPL were generated acutely on thrombin activation ( 40 ). Some of these were already structurally characterized eoxPL, but many remain incompletely annotated with only partial structural information, eg specifying the chain length, number of rings/double bonds, and oxygenation ( 40 ). Taking this further, we expanded the study up to 28 subjects (50:50 male:female), to test the impact on eoxPL generation of (i) aspirin, (ii) gender, and (iii) seasonality. Subjects first provided a baseline blood sample following a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug washout, and the generation of the 48 most abundant eoxPL was measured ( 40 ).

Lipids were putatively assigned as either COX-1 or 12-LOX-derived based on known sources of free oxylipins in platelets, eg 12-HETE (12-LOX), or DiEHEDA (COX-1) ( 45 ). We also considered oxylipins containing 20:4;3O as being likely prostaglandins, e.g. PGE 2 , which are known to be generated in eoxPL forms by platelets ( 46 ). Across the panel, 38 out of 48 lipids were significantly elevated on thrombin activation ( Fig. 3 A). Next, to analyze the impact of aspirin on thrombin stimulation of eoxPL generation, platelets were obtained after 1 week on 75 mg/day aspirin in the same individuals. Most lipids we had proposed to originate from COX-1 were significantly suppressed ( Fig. 3 B, orange markers). This data confirm the enzymatic origin of putative COX-1 derived eoxPL.

The 12-HETE-containing eoxPL increased following aspirin supplementation, although this did not reach significance ( Fig. 3 B, blue markers). When analyzed for gender differences, the median diacyl 12-HETE-PL were consistently elevated in males following aspirin treatment, although this was only significant for PC 18:1_12-HETE ( supplemental Fig. S8 B, C). In contrast, aspirin had no discernible effect on diacy-12-HETE-PL generation in females ( supplemental Fig. S9 A). This small increase in diacyl-12-HETE-PL in males is similar to that seen in the clinical cohort, further supporting the idea that it relates to aspirin. Unfortunately, plasmalogen forms of 12-HETE-PL were below LOQ for these samples and could not be compared.

The small elevations of diacyl-12-HETE-PL could result from either higher generation of free 12-HETE or increased rates of esterification of 12-HETE into lysoPL, by ACSL/LPLAT enzymes ( 33 ). To test this, levels of 12-HETE and TXB2 were analyzed in activated samples, however while TXB2 generation was suppressed around 95% by aspirin, there was no elevation in free 12-HETE for either males or females ( Fig. 3 C, supplemental Fig. S9 B). This suggests that esterification of 12-HETE to form diacyl, but not plasmalogen-HETE-PL is enhanced by aspirin, supporting our observations in the cardiovascular cohort earlier.

Next, the influence of gender (in the absence of aspirin) was tested, and a trend toward reduced generation of several eoxPL in platelets from males was found, although following Bonferroni correction, these differences became not significant ( Fig. 3 D). The most affected lipids were either from LOX or unknown pathways, suggesting a lower overall thrombin response in males. Those that were reduced included two diacyl-12-HETE-PL (from LOX, PC 18:1a_12-HETE, and PC 16:0a_12-HETE) with two others being plasmalogen-PEs, PE 18:0p_20:5,O, and PE 18:1p_20:4,2O.

Gender differences in platelet reactivity were previously described and will be summarized in the Discussion.
The interindividual variability of platelet eoxPL, when repeatedly sampled over time, is unknown. To test this, a subgroup of healthy volunteers (7 males and 7 females) returned at two subsequent two monthly intervals to provide additional samples pre- and post-aspirin. When subjects were not on aspirin, generation of eoxPL from COX/LOX were up to 2.5-3-fold higher the following spring, a relatively modest fluctuation ( Fig. 4 A).

To assess biochemical relatedness of eoxPL molecular species, specifically, whether lipids showed behavior consistent with common biochemical/enzymatic origins, correlation plots were generated using the data from the first sampling time point (n = 28, basal, thrombin, ± aspirin supplementation).

For example, PEs containing HETEs, HDOHEs, or other monohydroxy lipids clustered together in groups. Briefly, 12-HETE-PC formed a separate cluster, indicating influence of the headgroup on biochemical behavior. COX-1 eoxPL correlated closely but were very distinct from other lipids, most likely due to the selective impact of aspirin. There were no negative correlations since all lipids either correlated positively or not at all. These data suggest that eoxPL are generated in groups based on common enzymatic pathways, and this will be explored next.
Aspirin supplementation in the clinical cohort demonstrated a complex regulation of platelet eoxPL, with 12-LOX-derived diacyl forms being selectively elevated, while COX-1 derived forms were reduced ( Fig. 1 ).

These data, along with our correlation analysis ( Fig. 4 C) suggest a complex biochemical network whereby structurally related eoxPL maybe formed via specific isoforms of ACSL/LPLATs via Lands cycle ( 33 ). However, to date, no information are available on which isoforms generate eoxPL in primary cells.
A strong candidate in platelets for supporting esterification of HETEs is LPCAT3 (LPLAT12 ( 34 ), MBOAT5) since this is specific for 18:2 and 20:4 and can use lysoPC, lysoPE, and lysoPS as substrates ( 34 , 47 , 48 , 49 , 50 ). Mice deficient in LPCAT3 do not survive to adulthood, so obtaining their platelets was not possible. An LPCAT3 inhibitor, (R )-HTS-3, recently became available, so this was tested in human platelets from three unrelated healthy donors ( 37 ). This compound has been shown to be inactive toward the related enzymes, LPCAT1 and LPIAT1, indicating some selectivity ( 37 ). Not only HETE-PL, but "

This compound has been shown to be inactive toward the related enzymes, LPCAT1 and LPIAT1, indicating some selectivity ( 37 ). Not only HETE-PL, but a wider group of previously identified platelet eoxPL were measured using LC/MS/MS, including additional COX-1 products, monohydroxy forms of longer chain PUFA (20:5, 22:3, 22:4, and 22:5) and nonenzymatic platelet products (5- and 8-HETE-PL) ( 40 ). The data suggest that LPCAT3 is required for generation of diacyl-12-HETE-PC and PE ( Fig. 5 A). However, plasmalogen-PE forms were less inhibited by (R )-HTS-3. Strikingly, COX-1-derived eoxPL and those containing longer chain n3 PUFA were not or only slightly affected ( Fig. 5 A). These data suggest that LPCAT3 selectively esterifies 12-HETE into eoxPL in platelets, showing a strong preference for acyl forms of lysoPL over plasmalogens.

Since in vivo aspirin supplementation elevated the levels of eoxPL that were shown here to be generated in an LPCAT3-dependent manner, we next examined the effect of aspirin on LPCAT3 activity directly. Here, human LPCAT3 was tested in the presence of 1 mM aspirin. Microsomal fractions of CHO cells overexpressing human LPCAT3 were used as an enzyme source. Aspirin did not affect LPCAT activity of LPCAT3 ( Fig. 5 B, C). Together, these data suggest that aspirin does not directly affect LPCAT3 and that the selective regulation of diacyl-12-HETE-PL generation by aspirin may instead relate to changes in LPCAT3 expression, expression or activity of upstream ACSLs, or levels of substrates available.

Next, to study in vivo generated eoxPL, arterial thrombi from patients were analyzed, comparing three anatomical sites: carotid, limb, and STEMI. Clots surgically obtained from patients were homogenized, lipids extracted, and HETE-PL measured using LC/MS/MS, followed by hydrolysis of fatty acyls and analysis of HETEs for chirality to confirm enzymatic origin. Briefly, 12-HETE from platelet 12-LOX, 15-HETE from leukocyte 15-LOX, and 5-HETE from neutrophil 5-LOX should be primarily S , while 15-HETEs from COX-1 can be either R or S ( 51 , 52 ). The 11-HETE generated by COX-1 is predominantly R ( 51 , 53 ).
Although the thrombi were from a small group of patients with differences due to age, demographics, and clinical background, there were clear eoxPL signatures seen that related to anatomical site. In carotid clots, 15-, 11-, and 5-HETE-PL were the prominent eoxPL with lower levels of 12- and 8-HETEs. This suggested white cells as the main source of eoxPL ( Fig. 6 A). "

This suggested white cells as the main source of eoxPL ( Fig. 6 A). Chiral analysis of carotid clot lipids showed that 12-, 15-, and 5-HETEs were all slightly more prominent as S isomer forms (55%–60%) while both 8- and 11-HETEs were around 50% S/R . Coupled with the higher levels of 15-HETE-PL versus 12- or 8-HETE-PL, we suggest that 15-HETE-PL originates from both leukocyte 15-LOX ( S ) and COX ( S/R ), while some of the 5-HETE-PL is from neutrophil 5-LOX ( S ) ( Fig. 6 B). The other HETE-PL, 12-, 8-, and 11- may be nonenzymatically derived. There was notable absence of 12-HETE-PL in carotid clots, suggesting little or no platelet involvement ( Fig. 6 A).

This indicated a platelet signature, largely dominated by 12-LOX (12-HETE-PL) with some COX-1-derived eoxPL (11-, 15-HETE-PL). As confirmation, limb and STEMI clots contained around 95% 12 S -HETE ( Fig. 6 B). In limb clots, 11-HETE was around 75% the R isomer, consistent with COX-1, although in STEMI, it was around 50% ( Fig. 6 B). Subsequently, 8-HETE in limb and STEMI clots was around 75% or 60% R ( Fig. 6 B). Although nonenzymatic oxidation would predict 50% S/R for 8-HETE, a similar predominance of the R enantiomer in serum from clotted blood was previously shown ( 53 , 54 ), and 8 R -HETE is a known side product of platelet 12-LOX ( 55 ).

This demonstrated separation of the STEMI and limb embolectomy samples in the PC1 direction (responsible for 65% of the variance) ( Fig. 6 D). The loadings plot demonstrates that the HETE-PL lipids most responsible for this separation in PC1 are three containing 12-HETE, namely two diacyl and one plasmalogen ( Fig. 6 E).

HETE-PL were quantified in platelets from patients with ACS, CAD, and RF basally and then following thrombin activation.

Five HETE positional isoforms (5-, 8-, 11-, 12-, and 15-) of these were quantified ( 10 ). Little or no HETE-PL were detected basally; however, thrombin stimulated large increases, particularly the abundant 12-HETE-PL species formed via 12-LOX ( 10 ) ( Fig. 1 A). Other HETE-PL also were formed on activation, mainly 15- and 11-HETE-PL but also very low levels of 8-HETE-PL, while 5-HETE-PL were below limit of detection ( Fig. 1 B, C, supplemental Fig. S2 A). Briefly, 12-HETE-PL were formed at significantly higher levels in activated platelets from all patient groups, than HC ( Fig. 1 A). The increase in 12-HETE-PL was due to higher levels of the three diacyl-12-HETE-PL, with no significant differences for plasmalogens ( Fig. 1 D–F, supplemental Fig. S2 B–D).

In contrast, 15- and 11-HETE-PL were significantly reduced in activated platelets from all groups compared to HC ( Fig. 1 B, C). Here, both plasmalogen and acyl-forms of HETE-PEs, and PCs were impacted equally ( supplemental Figs. S2 E–J, S3 A–E). Subsequently, 8-HETE-PL in activated platelets were not different for patient groups versus HC ( supplemental Fig. 2 A). Overall, this indicates that diacyl-eoxPL from 12-LOX are significantly higher in patient groups, while both acyl and plasmalogen 15- and 11-HETE-PL species are reduced. The enzymatic origin of these lipids will be explored below. Fig. 1 Aspirin reduces COX-1 generated eoxPL but increases 12-LOX generated acyl eoxPL in thrombin-activated platelets in ASCVD.

To test this, the effect of aspirin supplementation was determined. All ACS, but no HC participants were taking aspirin ( supplemental Table S8 ). In contrast, in both the RF and CAD groups, a small number were not on aspirin allowing direct comparison within these groups. Although patient numbers in some groups were relatively low, a significant suppressive effect of aspirin on both 11- and 15-HETE-PL generation was clearly observed, while for participants not on aspirin in the HC, RF, and CAD groups, there were no significant differences ( Fig. 1 G–J). Aspirin supplementation was also associated with a significant increase in 12-HETE-PL levels in the RF + CAD groups ( Fig. 1 K), while for participants not on aspirin, there was no impact of disease ( Fig. 1 L).

Next, the individual isoforms of 12-HETE-PL in the RF + CAD groups were measured. In the case of 12-HETE-PL, two of the three diacyl isoforms were significantly increased in platelets by aspirin supplementation, while for all plasmalogens, there was no effect ( supplemental Fig. S3 F). Last, since all female RF and CAD patients were on aspirin, to test the effect of gender, males only were compared. As seen above, aspirin significantly increased platelet generation of diacyl 12-HETE-PL for RF + CAD males ( supplemental Fig. S4 ). In contrast, reductions in 11- and 15-HETE-PL were seen for both acyl and plasmalogen forms in CAD and RF groups, with many PCs in the aspirin groups being below LOQ of our assay, and not quantifiable ( supplemental Fig. S5 ).

This idea will be further tested in a healthy cohort, later. Using clinical data, eoxPL generation by platelets was also compared to either medication use (anticoagulants, P2Y12 inhibitors, and statins) or other diseases (diabetes, hypertension), but no correlations were noted.
eoxPL generation was modulated by vascular disease in ionophore-activated leukocytes
Next, HETE-PL levels were analyzed in leukocyte isolates obtained from patients and healthy control subjects both basally and after ionophore activation, to determine the capacity of the cells to generate them. Generation of eoxPL by ionophore-activated leukocytes was demonstrated, particularly in healthy control samples ( Fig. 2 A).

However, levels of eoxPL were lower than in platelets, with a higher degree of samples falling below assay LOQ for individual molecular species. Several HETE-PL formed on activation, mainly 15-, 12-, or 5-HETEs, with 11-HETE-PL being generated at very low levels ( Fig. 2 A, D–F, supplemental Figs. S6 and S7 ). Overall, total 5-HETE-PL (when normalized to leukocyte numbers) generated by 5-LOX showed a small nonsignificant trend to elevate in all groups ( Fig. 2 A, supplemental Fig. 6 A). When cell counts for the patient groups were compared, a significant increase was seen for ACS versus RF for both total white cells and neutrophils ( Fig. 2 B, C). Thus in vivo, the amounts of 5-HETE-PE generated overall may be further elevated due to the higher cell counts. Generation of several 15, 12, or 11-HETE-PL species were significantly decreased in patient groups, versus HC ( Fig. 2 D–F, supplemental Figs. S6 B, S7 ). We next examined if this "

Characterizing the impact of aspirin and gender on eoxPL generation by human platelets from healthy volunteers
To further test the impact of aspirin on platelet eoxPL, we turned to a healthy cohort. Previously, in platelets from three unrelated healthy human donors, we found that ∼100 eoxPL were generated acutely on thrombin activation ( 40 ). Some of these were already structurally characterized eoxPL, but many remain incompletely annotated with o"

Some of these were already structurally characterized eoxPL, but many remain incompletely annotated with only partial structural information, eg specifying the chain length, number of rings/double bonds, and oxygenation ( 40 ). Taking this further, we expanded the study up to 28 subjects (50:50 male:female), to test the impact on eoxPL generation of (i) aspirin, (ii) gender, and (iii) seasonality. Subjects first provided a baseline blood sample following a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug washout, and the generation of the 48 most abundant eoxPL was measured ( 40 ). Lipids were putatively assigned as either COX-1 or 12-LOX-derived based on known sources of free oxylipins in platelets, eg 12-HETE (12-LOX), or DiEHEDA (COX-1) ( 45 ). We also considered oxylipins containing 20:4;3O as being likely prostaglandins, e.g. PGE 2 , which are known to be generated in eoxPL forms by platelets ( 46 ). A"

We also considered oxylipins containing 20:4;3O as being likely prostaglandins, e.g. PGE 2 , which are known to be generated in eoxPL forms by platelets ( 46 ). Across the panel, 38 out of 48 lipids were significantly elevated on thrombin activation ( Fig. 3 A). Next, to analyze the impact of aspirin on thrombin stimulation of eoxPL generation, platelets were obtained after 1 week on 75 mg/day aspirin in the same individuals. Most lipids we had proposed to originate from COX-1 were significantly suppressed ( Fig. 3 B, orange markers). This data confirm the enzymatic origin of putative COX-1 derived eoxPL. The 12-HETE-containing eoxPL increased following aspirin supplementation, although this did not reach significance ( Fig. 3 B, blue markers). When analyzed for gender differences, the median diacyl 12-HETE-PL were consistently elevated in males following aspirin treatment, although this was only significant for PC 18:1_12-HETE ( supplemental Fig. "
PMC11754521,PMC11754521_chunk_134,"alyzed for gender differences, the median diacyl 12-HETE-PL were consistently elevated in males following aspirin treatment, although this was only significant for PC 18:1_12-HETE ( supplemental Fig. S8 B, C). In contrast, aspirin had no discernible effect on diacy-12-HETE-PL generation in females ( supplemental Fig. S9 A). This small increase in diacyl-12-HETE-PL in males is similar to that seen in the clinical cohort, further supporting the idea that it relates to aspirin. Unfortunately, plasmalogen forms of 12-HETE-PL were below LOQ for these samples and could not be compared. The small elevations of diacyl-12-HETE-PL could result from either higher generation of free 12-HETE or increased rates of esterification of 12-HETE into lysoPL, by ACSL/LPLAT enzymes ( 33 ). To test this, levels of 12-HETE and TXB2 were analyzed in activated samples, however while TXB2 generation was suppressed around 95% by aspirin, there was no elevation in free 12-HETE for either males or females ( Fig. 3 "
PMC11754521,PMC11754521_chunk_135,"of 12-HETE and TXB2 were analyzed in activated samples, however while TXB2 generation was suppressed around 95% by aspirin, there was no elevation in free 12-HETE for either males or females ( Fig. 3 C, supplemental Fig. S9 B). This suggests that esterification of 12-HETE to form diacyl, but not plasmalogen-HETE-PL is enhanced by aspirin, supporting our observations in the cardiovascular cohort earlier.

Next, the influence of gender (in the absence of aspirin) was tested, and a trend toward reduced generation of several eoxPL in platelets from males was found, although following Bonferroni correction, these differences became not significant ( Fig. 3 D). The most affected lipids were either from LOX or unknown pathways, suggesting a lower overall thrombin response in males. Those that were reduced included two diacyl-12-HETE-PL (from LOX, PC 18:1a_12-HETE, and PC 16:0a_12-HETE) with two others being plasmalogen-PEs, PE 18:0p_20:5,O, and PE 18:1p_20:4,2O. None of these were impacted by aspirin in either males or females, indicating they are not generated by COX-1. However, when subjects were on aspirin, this small gender effect was attenuated ( Fig. 3 E).

To test this, a subgroup of healthy volunteers (7 males and 7 females) returned at two subsequent two monthly intervals to provide additional samples pre- and post-aspirin.

In contrast, most lipids assigned as “unknown” did not show any seasonal variation ( Fig. 4 A). When subjects were on aspirin, the increase in COX-derived lipids in spring was not seen since their generation was reduced overall ( Fig. 4 B), although for LOX-derived eoxPL the seasonal trend remained, while as before “unknowns” were largely unaffected.

Here, groupings aligned with Sn -2 fatty acyl oxylipin structure strongly ( Fig. 4 C). For example, PEs containing HETEs, HDOHEs, or other monohydroxy lipids clustered together in groups.

A strong candidate in platelets for supporting esterification of HETEs is LPCAT3 (LPLAT12 ( 34 ), MBOAT5) since this is specific for 18:2 and 20:4 and can use lysoPC, lysoPE, and lysoPS as substrates ( 34 , 47 , 48 , 49 , 50 ). Mice deficient in LPCAT3 do not survive to adulthood, so obtaining their platelets was not possible. An LPCAT3 inhibitor, (R )-HTS-3, recently became available, so this was tested in human platelets from three unrelated healthy donors ( 37 ). This compound has been shown to be inactive toward the related enzymes, LPCAT1 and LPIAT1, indicating some selectivity ( 37 ).

The data suggest that LPCAT3 is required for generation of diacyl-12-HETE-PC and PE ( Fig. 5 A). However, plasmalogen-PE forms were less inhibited by (R )-HTS-3. Strikingly, COX-1-derived eoxPL and those containing longer chain n3 PUFA were not or only slightly affected ( Fig. 5 A). These data suggest that LPCAT3 selectively esterifies 12-HETE into eoxPL in platelets, showing a strong preference for acyl forms of lysoPL over plasmalogens.

Clots surgically obtained from patients were homogenized, lipids extracted, and HETE-PL measured using LC/MS/MS, followed by hydrolysis of fatty acyls and analysis of HETEs for chirality to confirm enzymatic origin. Briefly, 12-HETE from platelet 12-LOX, 15-HETE from leukocyte 15-LOX, and 5-HETE from neutrophil 5-LOX should be primarily S , while 15-HETEs from COX-1 can be either R or S ( 51 , 52 ). The 11-HETE generated by COX-1 is predominantly R ( 51 , 53 ).

Although the thrombi were from a small group of patients with differences due to age, demographics, and clinical background, there were clear eoxPL signatures seen that related to anatomical site. In carotid clots, 15-, 11-, and 5-HETE-PL were the prominent eoxPL with lower levels of 12- and 8-HETEs. This suggested white cells as the main source of eoxPL ( Fig. 6 A). Chiral analysis of carotid clot lipids showed that 12-, 15-, and 5-HETEs were all slightly more prominent as S isomer forms (55%–60%) while both 8- and 11-HETEs were around 50% S/R . Coupled with the higher levels of 15-HETE-PL versus 12- or 8-HETE-PL, we suggest that 15-HETE-PL originates from both leukocyte 15-LOX ( S ) and COX ( S/R ), while some of the 5-HETE-PL is from neutrophil 5-LOX ( S ) ( Fig. 6 B).

The other HETE-PL, 12-, 8-, and 11- may be nonenzymatically derived. There was notable absence of 12-HETE-PL in carotid clots, suggesting little or no platelet involvement ( Fig. 6 A). In contrast, STEMI and limb clots were characterized by higher levels of 12-, followed by 15-, and 11-HETE-PL, then lower amounts of 5- and 8-HETE-PL. This indicated a platelet signature, largely dominated by 12-LOX (12-HETE-PL) with some COX-1-derived eoxPL (11-, 15-HETE-PL). As confirmation, limb and STEMI clots contained around 95% 12 S -HETE ( Fig. 6 B). In limb clots, 11-HETE was around 75% the R isomer, consistent with COX-1, although in STEMI, it was around 50% ( Fig. 6 B). Subsequently, 8-HETE in limb and STEMI clots was around 75% or 60% R ( Fig. 6 B). Although nonenzymatic oxidation would predict 50% S/R for 8-HETE, a similar predominance of the R en"

Although nonenzymatic oxidation would predict 50% S/R for 8-HETE, a similar predominance of the R enantiomer in serum from clotted blood was previously shown ( 53 , 54 ), and 8 R -HETE is a known side product of platelet 12-LOX ( 55 ). In limb and STEMI clots, 5-HETE-PL were relatively low in comparison to other positional isomers and were around 50%–60% S isomer ( Fig. 6 B). Thus, they may be primarily nonenzymatic, with a small involvement of neutrophil 5-LOX. Notably, clots contain large amounts of hemoglobin which could directly contribute to nonenzymatic oxidation, either in vivo or during lipid extraction, despite inclusion of antioxidants and metal chelators.

Discussion
How procoagulant membranes of blood cells are altered in cardiovascular disease is poorly understood, along with how they contribute to thrombotic risk, and also their involvement in formation of human clots in situ. Previously, eoxPL were shown to be elevated in blood cells from patients with venous thrombosis, and are procoagulant in vitro and in vivo ( 56 ). However, up to now, their formation in ASCVD has not been investigated. Herein, using lipidomics, we characterized eoxPL in human ASCVD in blood cells and retrieved clots, as well as in platelets from a healthy cohort. In ASCVD patients, platelet eoxPL generation showed complex changes that primarily were associated with aspirin supplementation, findings which were then confirmed in a healthy cohort.

Complex impacts of aspirin on eoxPL generation were uncovered that can be summarized as follows: (i) inhibition of COX-1 derived eoxPL generation, (ii) elevation of Lands cycle-dependent diacyl-12-HETE-PL generation in platelets, via LPCAT3, (iii) abrogation of gender and seasonal impacts on eoxPL generation in healthy volunteers. These data show that aspirin’s impact on bleeding/thrombosis may move beyond platelet aggregation blockade, into modulation of membrane-dependent coagulation. How eoxPL modulation by aspirin impacts thrombotic risk via coagulation in humans in health and disease warrants further study.
Our study found that LPCAT3 mediates diacyl-12-HETE-PE/PC generation in platelets, providing the first direct evidence of a specific acylation enzyme forming eoxPL. Up to now, the particular Lands cycle enzymes catalyzing oxylipin esterification have remained unknown. The expression and activity o"

Up to now, the particular Lands cycle enzymes catalyzing oxylipin esterification have remained unknown. The expression and activity of LPCAT3, and other LPAT isoforms in platelets is currently unknown and requires further study. The lack of involvement of LPCAT3 in esterification of 11- or 15-HETEs generated by COX-1 suggests there maybe compartmentalization of 12-HETE-PL biosynthetic enzymes within platelets, specifically phospholipaseA 2 , 12-LOX, ACSL, and LPCAT3. This is further supported by our previous observations that exogenously-added 12-HETE- d8 is not esterified into eoxPL following acute platelet activation to form 12-HETE- d8 -PE, in place of endogenously-generated 12-HETE ( 10 ). Also, the lack of esterification of monohydroxy-oxylipins from longer chain unsaturated PUFA by LPCAT3 is consistent with the known substrate preference of this enzyme for 20:4.

Low-dose aspirin increased platelet generation of diacyl 12-HETE-PL. Although this could be due to increased availability of arachidonate substrate when COX-1 is inhibited ( 57 ), free 12-HETE generation by platelets was not elevated by aspirin in the healthy cohort, and only eoxPL which we found are formed by LPCAT3 were affected. This indicates that generation of eoxPL is also controlled at the level of esterification, suggesting LPCAT3 is somehow modulated by aspirin indirectly. Further studies are needed to determine the mechanism. In contrast, inhibition of COX-derived eoxPL by aspirin is expected to be due to direct inhibition of the enzyme. No difference in eoxPL generation was seen for the small number of patients on P2Y12 inhibitors. This receptor is the target of ADP activation of platelets, and we previously found that ADP is una"

This receptor is the target of ADP activation of platelets, and we previously found that ADP is unable to induce 12-HETE generation by platelets providing a potential explanation for this finding ( 58 ).
As 12-HETE-PL are the most quantitatively abundant positional isomers of HETE-PL, the overall impact of aspirin appears to result in higher total levels of platelet eoxPL in platelets from patients taking this drug. Importantly, resting platelets contain little or no eoxPL, with these lipids being generated following agonist challenge. This means that, in vivo, while a patient is otherwise healthy, eoxPL in the circulation should be very low, unless a challenge occurs, eg through trauma, infection, or plaque rupture. Where 12-LOX-derived lipids are elevated by aspirin, they could potentially antagonize the antithrombotic impact of thromboxane A2 (TXA 2 ) inhibition, through promoting th"

Where 12-LOX-derived lipids are elevated by aspirin, they could potentially antagonize the antithrombotic impact of thromboxane A2 (TXA 2 ) inhibition, through promoting the procoagulant impact of the platelet membrane. The clinical impact of aspirin has always been considered to be primarily via its antiplatelet effects, not via modulation of coagulation per se. In support, washed platelets from patients on aspirin therapy still mount a procoagulant phenotype in vitro ( 59 , 60 , 61 ). However, this does not exclude that eoxPL may influence coagulation under the conditions under which they are generated within the complex milieu of a thrombus in vivo. In line with this, a strong signature of platelet derived eoxPL was seen in retrieved human STEMI and limb clots, although it is not known at what stage of thrombus formation they were generated (eg early or late). Agreeing with the proposed role of these lipids in driving arterial coagulation in vivo, Alox15 "
PMC11754521,PMC11754521_chunk_175,"s, although it is not known at what stage of thrombus formation they were generated (eg early or late). Agreeing with the proposed role of these lipids in driving arterial coagulation in vivo, Alox15 −/− mice, which lack many eoxPL, generated smaller thrombi in an arterial model of AAAs ( 15 ), and higher levels of eoxPL are associated with prothrombotic autoimmunity ( 8 ). Furthermore, we previously showed that both Alox15 −/− and Alox12 −/− mice form smaller venous thrombi in vivo and have a hemostatic defect that can be corrected using eoxPL administration ( 15 ).
Leukocyte generation of eoxPL was also modulated in patients with arterial disease, specifically increased neutrophil 5-HETE-PL were detected, combined with moderate reductions in other isoforms. Decreased 11- and 15-HETE-PE could result from inhibition of white cell COX-1 by aspirin; however, due to the small patient numbers a clear effect was not obvious, and also, 15-HETE-PL in leukocytes can also come from eosinophil 1"

In white blood cell (WBC) samples, a likely source of 12-HETE-PL is platelet-leukocyte aggregates, since human WBC do not generally express 12-LOX. These are elevated in ASCVD, and aspirin can dampen their formation ( 62 , 63 ). Overall, the detailed reasons for WBC eoxPL changing in disease are not clear and require further study.
To test our hypothesis that aspirin regulated eoxPL in ASCVD, we next analyzed samples from a healthy cohort. Here, complex gender and seasonal differences in platelet eoxPL formation were seen. First, platelets from females tended to mount a stronger response to thrombin in relation to eoxPL formation.

This finding agrees with numerous previous studies showing that platelets from females aggregate more robustly to several agonists in vitro ( 64 , 65 , 66 ). The rather small gender difference was largely abrogated by aspirin supplementation, suggesting that it may somewhat rely on secondary activation triggered by TXA 2 . A second gender difference was seen for LPCAT3-dependent formation of diacyl 12-HETE-PL, which tended to be elevated in males by aspirin, but not females. This mirrored the significant elevations in males in the clinical cohort and showing a gender-specific effect of aspirin on a subgroup of eoxPL by human platelets. How hormones regulate the procoagulant membrane, specifically via LPCAT3, is currently unknown, despite the well-known gender bias for thrombotic risk in men, which increases in women post menopause.

We note that in our clinical cohort, the small number of females would be expected to be post menopausal, while in the health cohort, they were all younger than age 50. Last, the relative expression of LOX, COX, and LPATs in males versus females is unknown.
Unexpectedly, while most eoxPL were relatively stable across the three sampling periods, COX-1 and LOX derived eoxPL steadily increased throughout, peaking in spring. Although only a relatively small increase of 1.5–3 fold, it was consistently observed for ∼15 individual lipid species. The seasonal change for COX-1-derived eoxPL was blunted by aspirin. The basis of this fluctuation is unknown, and we found no reports of seasonal variation in platelet activities in the literature.

Unfortunately, a fourth sample per patient was not obtained during the study period and so eoxPL generation could not be followed further. Although samples were in storage for different times, we do not expect this to have selectively led to changes in only some eoxPL versus others as storage time was overall less than a year.
We previously used chiral chromatography to evidence the direct enzymatic involvement of LOX enzymes in generating platelet and Th2 macrophage eoxPL ( 10 , 11 ). Taking this further, here, limb or STEMI clots were characterized by a strong platelet eoxPL signature, while white cell or nonenzymatic eoxPL dominated the composition of carotid thrombi. Although these clots were formed in vivo under flow, the content of the clot could be influenced by other anatomical/pathological factors.

For instance, carotid clot may be contaminated by significant amount of plaque lipid relative to clot. This is due to the nature of the surgical extraction technique which may also explain the lower total amounts of oxPL. Consistent with this, a predominance of 15-HETE-PL was seen in carotid samples which may originate from macrophages/foam cells in plaque lesions ( 67 ). Free 15-HETE has previously been reported as a component of human carotid plaques, but was deemed to be nonenzymatically generated ( 68 ). Our chiral analysis agrees with this, since it indicated relatively similar proportions of S and R stereoisomers in carotid plaque. This is consistent with studies examining the enantiomeric composition of hydroxyoctodecadienoic acids within advanced atherosclerotic plaques ( 69 ). The physiological age of the analyzed clots may also contribute differences. STEMI clots were retrieved within"

The physiological age of the analyzed clots may also contribute differences. STEMI clots were retrieved within a short time from formation (<3 h) compared to carotid clots (days/weeks). Thus, the 12 S -HETE-PL dominant profile in STEMI clots may relate to an acute burst of platelet activation in the first few hours of thrombosis, compared to the carotid clots where time has passed since formation which allows for clot metabolism to take place by the generation of an organized fibrin scaffold, modification to the cellular components and possible PL degradation ( 70 , 71 , 72 ). This could also contribute to higher observed amounts of HETE-PL seen owing due to a level of inflammatory cell activation in the acute phase ( 73 ). Clots collected from limb embolectomies varied in retrieval time (“age”), and this may explain the mixed picture observed in the multivariate analysis where despite an overall "

Clots collected from limb embolectomies varied in retrieval time (“age”), and this may explain the mixed picture observed in the multivariate analysis where despite an overall similar profile to STEMI, at least two of the “oldest” clots were behaving in a way closer to carotid clots. Other factors that may explain the variability include interindividual variability, comorbidity profile, medications, or lifestyle choices. However, the current sample size is not sufficiently powered to investigate this in depth.
While cells from patients with ACS demonstrated lipidomic and biological differences, it is not possible to determine causality since it is not possible to predict when an ACS event will occur ( 74 ).

Conclusions
In summary, procoagulant eoxPL generation is altered in platelets and leukocytes from patients with ASCVD, potentially contributing to thrombotic risk. Aspirin is the most widely prescribed drug globally for secondary vascular prevention ( 75 , 76 ), with its primary effect being inhibition of the platelet lipid, thromboxane A2 (TXA 2 ) ( 77 ). Clinically, aspirin is generally used as an antiplatelet agent in arterial disease, versus anticoagulants like warfarin which predominate clinically in venous thrombosis ( 78 ). Here, aspirin but not P2Y12 inhibitors had a complex and selective impact on eoxPL generation in both health and disease, thus its influence on the procoagulant membrane needs to be considered.

• Through retrospective analysis of critically ill patients in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database, it was found that statin use could potentially reduced the risk of death in patients in intensive care units (ICUs).
• Compared with other statins, simvastatin had the highest reduction of mortality among patients in the ICU.
• In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, acute kidney injury, sepsis, or myocardial infarction, statin use was associated with reduced 28-day mortality, while the association of statin use and 28-day mortality did not differ according to sex.
What is known and what is new?
• Statins can lower blood cholesterol levels and prevent cardiovascular events in patients with cardiovascular disease.
• This study further confirmed the benefits of statin multipotency in treating patients in the ICU, which can potentially improve the prognosis of those with multiple diseases and perhaps reduce mortality.

• Clinicians should be aware of the importance of statins and decide upon whether to add or cease statins according to the actual situation of patients and not arbitrarily.
Introduction
The hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors), commonly referred to as statins, have traditionally been used for the purpose of reducing blood cholesterol levels or preventing cardiovascular events in patients diagnosed with cardiovascular disease"
PMC11833575,PMC11833575_chunk_3,"commonly referred to as statins, have traditionally been used for the purpose of reducing blood cholesterol levels or preventing cardiovascular events in patients diagnosed with cardiovascular disease ( 1 ). Approximately 200 million patients are treated with this drug globally. These agents impede the activity of the pivotal enzyme in cholesterol synthesis, thereby diminishing cholesterol production. Simultaneously, they enhance the expression of cell surface low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, accelerating the catabolism of serum LDL. Consequently, statins markedly lower levels of serum total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and apolipoprotein B (ApoB); moderately decrease serum triglyceride (TG) levels; and elevate high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels ( 2 ).

These multifaceted effects on the vascular endothelium include immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and antithrombotic activity ( 3 - 5 ). These non-lipid-related benefits, termed the “pleiotropic effect”, may enhance the prognosis of patients across various diseases ( 6 ), even extending potential benefit to patients with noncardiovascular conditions such as cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and rheumatoid arthritis ( 7 ). The immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects of statins have garnered significant attention in recent years, leading to their investigation as a host-directed therapy for the treatment of infectious diseases ( 8 ).

Concerning anti-inflammatory activity, the growing incidence of sepsis and related fatalities necessitates the further development of therapeutic interventions. In animal models of sepsis ( 9 , 10 ), statins demonstrated inhibitory effects on inflammatory mediators, potentially by disrupting isoprenoid intermediates in the mevalonate pathway. This interference allows for the upregulation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) inhibitors, inhibiting NF-κB-dependent inflammation. Statins also mitigate the cellular damage associated with endotoxins and exotoxins, reverse renal tubular hypoxia, and directly impact the renal vascular system, potentially ameliorating the acute kidney injury (AKI) induced by sepsis ( 11 , 12 ).

PMC11833575,PMC11833575_chunk_6,"ence of fungal infections has exhibited a substantial rise with the administration of immunosuppressive agents, radiotherapy for neoplasms, in vivo tube placements, and extended stays in intensive care units (ICUs). Statins have demonstrated antifungal efficacy and can synergistically enhance the effectiveness of antifungal medications ( 13 ). The possible pathway mechanisms for this effect involve, first, the inhibition of farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) production in the mevalonate pathway by statins, which impedes ergosterol biosynthesis, a crucial component in fungal cell membranes ( 14 ). Second, statins may suppress the isoprenylation pathway, hindering the activation of vital cellular proteins involved in cellular respiration and iron metabolism ( 15 , 16 ). Third, statins may induce fungal mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis. Finally, the statin-induced blockade of HMG-CoA reductase can dampen fungal spore germination ( 17 ).

As it relates to antithrombotic activity, venous thromboembolism, including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, represents a frequent complication in critically ill patients, correlating with substantial morbidity and mortality. Cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36), a single-chain glycoprotein expressed on various cell surfaces, binds to platelet membrane CD36, initiating endogenous reactive oxygen species production and causing platelet activation and thrombosis ( 18 ). Statins can exert inhibitory effects on platelet activation and aggregation either through direct interaction with CD36 or by modulating the intracellular signaling pathway of CD36, among other pathways.

Patients in the ICU have a high incidence of complications such as cardiovascular diseases, severe infection, and thrombosis, and almost all patients in the ICU experience systemic inflammatory response syndromes, leading to a high mortality rate ( 19 ). Investigating the potentially advantageous pleiotropic effects of statins in the ICU setting could potentially yield substantial benefits for clinical practice and public health. We employed a population subset from a comprehensive public critical care database to examine the correlation between statin usage and 28-day all-cause mortality among adult patients in the ICU.

After PSM, 6,213 (58.36%) in the atorvastatin group, 730 (6.86%) in the rosuvastatin group, 2,817 (26.46%) in the simvastatin group, and 886 (8.32%) in the other statin group. After PSM and adjustment for all covariates to mitigate confounding effects, patients in the statin group exhibited an overall 31% lower risk of death compared to the nonstatin group [hazard ratio (HR) =0.69; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.63–0.75; P<0.001]. As it relates to different statin types, compared to the nonstatin group, atorvastatin demonstrated a 26% lower risk (HR =0.74; 95% CI: 0.67–0.82; P<0.001), rosuvastatin a 34% lower risk (HR =0.66; 95% CI: 0.5–0.88; P=0.004), simvastatin a 44% lower risk (HR =0.56"

Survival analysis
The Kaplan-Meier survival curves indicated that the 28-day survival probability of the statin group surpassed that of the nonstatin group. Before PSM, the cohort comprised 50,624 patients, with 15,630 in the statin group and 34,994 in the nonstatin group, and the respective survival probabilities were 92.09% and 85.05%. Stratification by specific statins indicated survival rates of 94.08% for rosuvastatin, 93.32% for simvastatin, 91.66% for other statins, and 91.43% for atorvastatin.

Sensitivity analysis
We generate a PSM among the statin and non-statin group using a multivariable regression model. A 1:1 nearest neighbor matching algorithm was applied using a caliper width of 0.01. An SMD was used to examine the PSM degree. Furthermore, the variables mentioned above as covariates were selected to generate the propensity score. The estimated p"

Furthermore, the variables mentioned above as covariates were selected to generate the propensity score. The estimated propensity scores were used as weights. Pairwise algorithmic (PA), standardized mortality ratio weight (SMRW) models were used to generate a weighted cohort to adjust the baseline confounders, thus reflecting more truly the independent association between statin use and mortality.
The E value ( 21 ) of this study was 2.26, signifying that in the presence of an unmeasured covariate, the association with 28-day mortality was required to surpass a threshold of at least 2.26 to exert an impact on the robustness of the findings.

Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is characterized by an unexpected, natural death due to cardiac causes, typically occurring within one hour of the onset of symptoms [ 1 ]. SCD represents a significant public health concern due to its sudden onset and often unpredictable occurrence, impacting individuals across a wide range of ages and health conditions. The incidence of SCD varies significantly based on factors such as patient demographics, comorbidities, quality of surgical and postoperative care, and duration of follow-up.
While coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery is effective in reducing the risk of myocardial infarction and subsequent cardiac events by improving myocardial perfusion, the risk of SCD remains notable, with reported rates ranging from less than 1% to over 5% per year [ 2 – 5 ]. This persistent risk is likely due to factors such as incomplete or failed revascularization, progression of native vessel disease, and the presence of myocardial scars, whic"

This persistent risk is likely due to factors such as incomplete or failed revascularization, progression of native vessel disease, and the presence of myocardial scars, which can create a substrate for arrhythmogenic activity. A study analyzing a large database of patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or CABG identified several independent predictors of SCD in patients with chronic heart disease. These predictors included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤  30%, chronic total occlusion of a coronary artery, diabetes requiring insulin therapy, chronic renal disease, and peripheral artery disease [ 5 ]. Thus, managing cardiovascular (CV) risk factors has remained the focus of preventive strategy for improving clinical outcomes after CABG.

The CABG Patch Trial further underscored the complexity of SCD prevention by demonstrating that while implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy reduced arrhythmic deaths by 45%, it did not significantly affect non-arrhythmic deaths, resulting in no significant reduction in total mortality, as 71% of the deaths were non-arrhythmic [ 6 ]. A nationwide database from Sweden reported that 58% of all deaths following CABG were cardiac in origin, with heart failure being the most common cause (65% within 30 days post-CABG and 36% beyond 30 days), followed by myocardial infarction (56% and 29%, respectively) [ 7 ]. These two studies suggest failure of revascularization may be a bigger factor in this patient population leading to adverse clinical outcomes than arrhythmogenic substrate from scarring.

While patients with persistent low ejection fraction despite optimal GDMT are recommended to have ICD implant [ 9 ]; it is not recommended for patients undergoing CABG as a prophylaxis.
Complete surgical revascularization through CABG and optimal management of CV risk factors may be the most effective strategy for preventing fatal cardiac events leading to SCD. Therefore, it is vital to optimize medical therapy including antiplatelet therapy to sustain revascularization status after CABG.

Discussions
This study analyzed outcomes in 2,476 patients who underwent CABG and were subsequently treated with either AMT or DAPT ( Fig 3 ). The findings provide significant insights into the role of DAPT in preventing SCD and other adverse events post-CABG. The data reveals distinct differences in patient characteristics between those on AMT and DAPT. Patients receiving AMT were healthier but had a higher proportion of patients reporting stable angina. Conversely, the DAPT group exhibited a higher prevalence of peripheral artery disease, reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR < 60), prior PCI, pre-CABG use of DAPT, and a higher likelihood of undergoing on-pump surgery with a longer operative duration (see Table 1 ). These differences might indicate a more aggressive management approach in patients with more complex coronary disease or those at higher risk of thrombotic events.

After adjusting for these baseline differences, the study found a significantly lower incidence of SCD in patients receiving DAPT compared to those on AMT (0.8% vs. 3.1%). This finding is critical, as it suggests that DAPT may offer substantial protective effects against SCD in the post-CABG setting. The adjusted odds ratio (OR = 3.831) indicates that patients on AMT were nearly four times more likely to experience SCD than those on DAPT, highlighting the potential benefit of DAPT beyond its established role (see Table 2 ). While several randomized trials and metanalyses have demonstrated significant survival benefits with the use of DAPT in patients undergoing CABG after ACS [ 10 – 14 ].

Currently most guidelines focus on conventional therapies and general guidelines for managing patients with CAD, such as lifestyle modification, medical management of cardiovascular risk factors. Post-hoc analysis reporting on SCD after CABG showed that the numerically greatest monthly rate of SCD was in the 31- to 90-day time period [ 2 ]. For those with depressed left ventricular ejection fraction, defibrillator is not recommended until 90 days after CABG. It is crucial to identify potential treatments that can lower the risk of SCD or any death in general in this time. Perhaps DAPT therapy is one such treatment strategy and merits further research to address this question more definitively.

DAPT appears to reduce early mortality within the first 3 months post-CABG by preventing thrombotic graft occlusion, a key mechanism underlying the observed survival benefit and the primary objective of this treatment strategy. The AMT group demonstrated a lower incidence of major bleeding compared to the DAPT group (OR: 0.704, 95% CI: 0.595–0.833, p < 0.001), indicating a more favorable bleeding profile.

The binary regression model further elucidates factors associated with a reduced risk of SCD, showing that the use of P2Y12 antagonists, better renal function (GFR > 60 mL/min), higher ejection fraction (EF), and lower body mass index (BMI) are all protective against SCD ( Table 3 ). While obesity and depressed ejection fraction has been reported as predictors of SCD previously, this study presents some interesting insights relevant to this topic.
Obesity:
These findings of our study underscore the strong association between higher BMI and increased risk of SCD in post-CABG patients.

Although there has been extensive research regarding the contribution of smoking to the pathogenesis of CAD and SCD the contribution of obesity is less understood. Blood volume and cardiac output increase with BMI, and obesity is known to affect diastolic function and to be associated with left ventricular hypertrophy (particularly when BMI is > 30 kg/m 2 ) and a prolonged QT-interval.

Ejection fraction:
As previously reported, we observed a significant protective role of higher ejection fraction in reducing the risk of SCD following CABG. Specifically, each unit increase in EF was associated with a 3.8% reduction in SCD risk (HR =  0.962, 95% CI: 0.939–0.986, p =  0.002), suggesting that better cardiac function mitigates mortality risk in this patient population ( Fig 2 ).

The findings provide significant insights into the role of DAPT in preventing SCD and other adverse events post-CABG. The data reveals distinct differences in patient characteristics between those on AMT and DAPT. Patients receiving AMT were healthier but had a higher proportion of patients reporting stable angina. Conversely, the DAPT group exhibited a higher prevalence of peripheral artery disease, reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR < 60), prior PCI, pre-CABG use of DAPT, and a higher likelihood of undergoing on-pump surgery with a longer operative duration (see Table 1 ). These differences might indicate a more aggressive management approach in patients with more complex coronary disease or those at higher risk of thrombotic events.

DAPT and sudden cardiac death after CABG
After adjusting for these baseline differences, the study found a significantly lower incidence of SCD in patients receiving DAPT compared to those on AMT (0.8% vs. 3.1%). This finding is critical, as it suggests that DAPT may offer substantial protective effects against SCD in the post-CABG setting. The adjusted odds ratio (OR = 3.831) indicates that patients on AMT were nearly four times more likely to experience SCD than those on DAPT, highlighting the potential benefit of DAPT beyond its established role (see Table 2 ). While several randomized trials and metanalyses have demonstrated significant survival benefits with the use of DAPT in patients undergoing CABG after ACS [ 10 – 14 ].

Currently most guidelines focus on conventional therapies and general guidelines for managing patients with CAD, such as lifestyle modification, medical management of cardiovascular risk factors. Post-hoc analysis reporting on SCD after CABG showed that the numerically greatest monthly rate of SCD was in the 31- to 90-day time period [ 2 ]. For those with depressed left ventricular ejection fraction, defibrillator is not recommended until 90 days after CABG. It is crucial to identify potential treatments that can lower the risk of SCD or any death in general in this time. Perhaps DAPT therapy is one such treatment strategy and merits further research to address this question more definitively. DAPT appears to reduce early mortality within the first 3 months post-CABG by preventing thrombotic graft occlusion, a key mechanism underlying the observed survival benefit and the primary objective of this treatment strategy.

The AMT group demonstrated a lower incidence of major bleeding compared to the DAPT group (OR: 0.704, 95% CI: 0.595–0.833, p < 0.001), indicating a more favorable bleeding profile. However, there was no significant difference in transfusion requirements between the two groups, with rates of 9.9% in the AMT group and 15.6% in the DAPT group (OR: 1.11, 95% CI: 0.85–1.45, p =  0.48). Importantly, no cases of cardiac tamponade or CNS bleeding were reported in either group, though one patient in the DAPT group died due to bleeding complications. These findings highlight the generally acceptable safety profile of DAPT after CABG, despite a slightly higher bleeding risk.

Binary regression model
The binary regression model further elucidates factors associated with a reduced risk of SCD, showing that the use of P2Y12 antagonists, better renal function (GFR > 60 mL/min), higher ejection fraction (EF), and lower body mass index (BMI) are all protective against SCD ( Table 3 ). While obesity and depressed ejection fraction has been reported as predictors of SCD previously, this study presents some interesting insights relevant to this topic.
Obesity:
These findings of our study underscore the strong association between higher BMI and increased risk of SCD in post-CABG patients. Specifically, each 1 kg/m² increase in BMI was linked to a 6.4% rise in SCD risk, highlighting the incremental effect of excess weight on adverse cardiovascular outcomes ( Fig 2 ).

Although there has been extensive research regarding the contribution of smoking to the pathogenesis of CAD and SCD the contribution of obesity is less understood. Blood volume and cardiac output increase with BMI, and obesity is known to affect diastolic function and to be associated with left ventricular hypertrophy (particularly when BMI is > 30 kg/m 2 ) and a prolonged QT-interval.

Viewing atherosclerosis as a crystalloid disease provides novel insights into the role of cholesterol crystals (CCs) in the development and subsequent rupture of atherosclerotic plaques, and their role in secondary ischemic and inflammatory tissue injury [ 1 ]. The realization that free cholesterol expands as it undergoes a phase change from a liquid to a solid crystalline state helps explain how the process of crystallization may lead to plaque rupture [ [2] , [3] , [4] , [5] ] related to the rapid increase in pressure and volume within the plaque that occurs during crystallization. These changes stretch and thin the plaque cap and leave it more vulnerable to disruption from direct trauma by sharp tips of CCs that can directly puncture the fibrous cap of the plaque [ 2 , 4 ] ( Fig. 1 ). Furthermore, CCs that form within the plaque core can tear the vasa vasorum causing intraplaque hemorrhage that can further expand the plaque's core and provide additional free cholesterol"

As CCs aggregate in the microcirculation they further impair perfusion of the tissues causing regional ischemia. Moreover, CCs embedded in the tissues can trigger an inflammatory response associated with macrophage infiltration, which causes inflammatory tissue damage [ 9 ]. When these events occur during coronary intervention it is referred to as the “no reflow phenomenon” related to microvascular obstruction by platelet thrombi and CCs emboli [ 8 , 10 ].

Plaque growth at the cellular level
Plaque growth is enhanced by CCs that first appear as fatty streaks in the arterial walls in early childhood [ 13 ]. CCs are believed to enhance early plaque growth by causing endothelial dysfunction that leads to the expression of cellular adhesion molecules (i.e. ICAM-1; VACAM-1; E -selectin) that enhance the entry of LDL-c and circulating leukocytes into the subintimal space [ 14 ]. CCs also form within the lipid bilayer of the endothelial cells which occurs when the density of free cholesterol in the cell membrane is enriched [ 15 , 16 ]. These CCs are then ejected into the sub-intimal space where they are mostly cleared by macrophages and degraded within liposomes. However, as the free cholesterol content within liposomes increases, new CCs may begin to develop, and as they outgrow their intracellular environment they are released into the subintimal space.

Further crystal growth leads to damage of liposomes with the release of lytic enzymes from the liposomes into the subintimal space leading to further tissue injury that eventually evolves into a free lipid pool [ 17 ] ( Fig. 4 ). Notably, contact of CCs with macrophages leads to signaling that attracts more macrophages by inducing monocyte chemotactic protein or chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) formerly MCP-1 [ 18 ]. This response is independent of CCs internalization into the macrophages. Moreover, incubation of CCs with macrophages triggers TNF-α which is known to reduce the expression of ABCA1 and reduce HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux, thus lending to accumulation of free cholesterol which is the substrate for CCs formation in the arterial wall [ 19 ].

The vulnerable atheromatous plaque
The morphologic features of plaque rupture were first described by Paris Constantinides in the 1960's who noted fissuring of the fibrous cap at the site of thrombus formation in patients who died of acute myocardial infarction [ 20 ]. Subsequent work by Davies et al. demonstrated that plaque ruptures occurred mainly at plaque edges where the fibrous cap ‘inserts' into the arterial wall [ 21 ]. Richardson et al. also demonstrated that the sites of rupture had extensive macrophage infiltration [ 22 ]. Furt"

Richardson et al. also demonstrated that the sites of rupture had extensive macrophage infiltration [ 22 ]. Further work by Henny et al. demonstrated that those sites were rich in collagenases that could break down the collagenous tissue support and then Gallis and Libby demonstrated that the inflammatory cells' release of metalloproteinases could weaken the plaque structure [ 23 , 24 ]. Although inflammation is critical to plaque instability these findings did not explain the initial trigger for the inflammatory flare and did not consider that plaque rupture could also occur independent of inflammation as a result of CC formation and expansion.

Since ethanol is a strong solvent of CCs their causal role in the development and rupture of atherosclerotic plaques was simply not considered. Ruptured plaque histology as seen by light microscopy in specimens obtained after fatal myocardial infarction also failed to provide clarity as to the events that led to plaque rupture, because the tissue processing for light microscopy used high concentrations of ethanol (up to 100 %) to dehydrate the tissues so they can be cut into thin sections and mounted on slides. This process readily dissolves CCs leaving behind ‘clefts’ that are empty spaces with the shape of crystals where CCs were previously present and now dissolved by the ethanol [ 26 ]. As a result, there was no appreciation of the way CCs could directly damage tissues. Thus, although the definition of the vulnerable plaque as one that progresses to rupture based on fea"

Thus, although the definition of the vulnerable plaque as one that progresses to rupture based on features described on light microscopy including a large lipid pool, a thin fibrous cap, loss of smooth muscle cell support and infiltration with inflammatory cells, it failed to describe the presence and potential role of CCs in plaque rupture [ 27 ].
Because multiple plaque ruptures have been found to occur concurrently in non-culprit arteries following an acute atherosclerotic event [ 28 , 29 ] it is now understood that clinical emphasis should look beyond the ‘vulnerable plaque’ and focus more on the ‘vulnerable patient’ [ 30 ].

Other microscopic procedures that can be performed on tissue samples without ethanol processing have provided unique insights into the role of CCs as they preserve CCs during tissue preparation.

Moreover, evaluation of shrinkage by vacuum or air drying demonstrated that this is also not significantly different from shrinkage with standard formalin and ethanol treatments that ranges around 10–15 % [ 31 ] ( Fig. 5 ).

The needle shapes are composed of pure cholesterol while rhomboidal shapes are cholesterol monohydrate which is the most common form of crystal noted in human plaques [ 32 ]. By SEM, CCs can be seen piercing and arising from the intimal surface of the arterial wall typically at sites of plaque rupture not only at the site of the tear but also on the surface of the plaque adjacent to the fibrous cap rupture.

Plaque inflammation
Given the appearance of CCs perforating the fibrous caps of atheromatous plaques observed by SEM and confocal microcopy, Abela proposed that CCs could also cause an inflammatory response akin to that triggered by other crystalloid conditions namely uric acid crystals in gout [ 34 , 35 ]. In collaboration with Latz from Bonn, Germany they proceeded to demonstrate the same inflammatory process as had been described for uric acid crystals by Martinon et al. [ 36 ]. Essentially, the inflammation occurs by activating NLRP3 inflammasomes that then activate interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and subsequently IL-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP) [ [37] , [38] , [39] ]. This provided strong evidence that CCs are recognized as foreign bodies by the innate immune system and thus able to trigger an inflammatory response. Other inflammation cytokines were found to be"

Other inflammation cytokines were found to be activated by CCs including complesomes and complement. These inflammatory activities lead to plaque destabilization by releasing metalloproteinases from the macrophages that cause local tissue breakdown leading to growth of the plaque core and arterial wall positive remodeling thus enhancing the risk for plaque rupture and/or erosion.
Plaque rupture and distal cholesterol crystal embolization
Appreciation that atherosclerotic plaques become structurally unstable due to CC induced inflammation and CC induced trauma leads to the understanding that CC formation is critical in the development of a vulnerable plaque [ 31 ]. Although cholesterol in the plaque core is typically present in a liquid and semi-liquid state [ 32 ], local physicochemical conditions can trigger crystallization [ 5 ]. T"

Although cholesterol in the plaque core is typically present in a liquid and semi-liquid state [ 32 ], local physicochemical conditions can trigger crystallization [ 5 ]. Thus, the greater the amount of liquid and free cholesterol, the greater the risk of CC formation, and the greater the risk of plaque rupture [ 2 ].
Local conditions within the plaque that can trigger cholesterol crystallization include increased amounts of free cholesterol, a basic pH, hydration of the cholesterol molecule to the monohydrated form and a drop in ambient temperature [ 5 ]. These physicochemical conditions may explain the increased risk of cardiovascular events during fall and winter [ 40 ] as well as the circadian early morning clustering of cardiovascular events that occur when the body core temperature may be lowered by several degrees centigrade [ 5 ].

Another clinical aspect that may be explained by the role of CCs in plaque rupture relates to the atypical symptoms in women who present with acute myocardial infarction [ 41 , 42 ]. Men have been shown to have larger lipid pools in their plaques compared to women, even for the same degree of arterial stenosis by angiography [ 43 ]. This may be related to the longer time men have to accumulate cholesterol within plaques while women are protected by estrogens but then catch up later in life with men [ 44 ]. Also, estrogens have been shown to dissolve CCs being of a very similar molecular structure to cholesterol [ 45 ].

Furthermore, CC cluster sizes are significantly smaller for women than men [ 46 ]. Hence the myocardial infarction may be less recognized clinically which could explain the higher mortality in women due to being missed [ 41 ] ( Fig. 6 ).

Recently Komatsu et al. using non-obstructive angioscopy (NOGA) demonstrated presence of CCs emerging from plaques in human aortas [ 12 ]. Shimmering crystals were seen to be floating out of atheromatous plaques by the gentle nudging of plaque with the angioscope during examination. Many CCs emanating from spontaneously ruptured plaques were captured by this process further confirming their presence in live patients. Other in vivo work with optical coherence tomography (OCT) by Tian et al. demonstrated the presence of CCs aggregates in both stable non-culprit and ruptured plaques. They proposed that the presence of CCs may provide an important independent prognostic signal of future risk of plaque instability by demonstrating that non-culprit plaques with CCs were more likely to have higher risk features including a larger lipid burden, more macrophages, and spotty calcification [ 47 , 48 ].

Men have been shown to have larger lipid pools in their plaques compared to women, even for the same degree of arterial stenosis by angiography [ 43 ]. This may be related to the longer time men have to accumulate cholesterol within plaques while women are protected by estrogens but then catch up later in life with men [ 44 ]. Also, estrogens have been shown to dissolve CCs being of a very similar molecular structure to cholesterol [ 45 ]. The reduced amount of cholesterol in the plaque core may still crystallize but the amount of free cholesterol is not large enough to cause plaque rupture but enough to perforate the fibrous cap to cause plaque erosion that can lead to thrombosis but in a slower and more protracted manner compared to men and explain the more ‘subtle stuttering’ symptoms in women with myocardial infarc"

Furthermore, CC cluster sizes are significantly smaller for women than men [ 46 ]. Hence the myocardial infarction may be less recognized clinically which could explain the higher mortality in women due to being missed [ 41 ] ( Fig. 6 ).

Frequency of cholesterol crystals in culprit human coronary arteries
Aspirates of the obstructive material from an occluded culprit coronary artery during acute myocardial infarction reveal extensive amounts of CCs in the aspirates intermixed with thrombus. In a study of 286 patients CC size, composition, and morphology were correlated with inflammatory biomarkers, cardiac enzymes, percent coronary stenosis as well as TIMI blush and flow grades [ 46 ]. Although women had significantly smaller CC clusters than men, they had higher CRP levels. The CCs were also confirmed to be cholesterol by crystallography during SEM and by infra-red spectroscopy.

Many CCs emanating from spontaneously ruptured plaques were captured by this process further confirming their presence in live patients. Other in vivo work with optical coherence tomography (OCT) by Tian et al. demonstrated the presence of CCs aggregates in both stable non-culprit and ruptured plaques. They proposed that the presence of CCs may provide an important independent prognostic signal of future risk of plaque instability by demonstrating that non-culprit plaques with CCs were more likely to have higher risk features including a larger lipid burden, more macrophages, and spotty calcification [ 47 , 48 ].

Therapy that affects CC growth and morphology
Several medications that are used to prevent and treat cardiovascular events were investigated for their potential for dissolving CCs. Agents that lower cholesterol and reduce inflammation seemed to be primary candidates and include statins, aspirin and colchicine.

Thus, it is conceivable that one of the mechanisms whereby statins reduce the risk of cardiovascular events relates to their ability to reduce crystal growth and expansion. Moreover, the effect of statins was found to be dose-related with higher doses having a significantly a greater reduction of the volume expansion [ 50 ] ( Fig. 10 ). Three different statins were tested and were found to have similar effects with atorvastatin being the most effective followed by simvastatin and pravastatin. A similar effect was noted in a study of human carotid plaques removed at endarterectomy where patients taking statins had evidence of dissolving CCs while those not taking stains prior to surgery had intact CCs [ 50 ].

Summary
Understanding how cholesterol in atherosclerotic plaques contributes to an acute cardiovascular event is critical to elucidating how to best treat patients with atherosclerotic disease. Although inflammation is a critical aspect of atherosclerosis, it is never-the-less a common response to an injury, which in the case of atherosclerotic plaque relates to the physical conversion of cholesterol into its crystalline phase. This process like many other crystalloid disease conditions such as gall stones, renal stones, uric acid crystals is known to trigger an inflammatory response.

The presented data provides evidence that cardiovascular events fall into the same category of a crystalloid-induced condition with the atherosclerotic plaque of an artery. CCs that embolize from ruptured plaques not only obstruct arterioles and capillaries leading to ischemia but also trigger inflammation that further adds to myocaradial injury. Hence, dissolving the CCs is potentially a major therapeutic step that may prove beneficial in the prevention and regulation of the cause of injury that leads to inflammation and direct tissue injury.

PMC11882106,PMC11882106_chunk_1,"Introduction
Coronary bifurcation lesions remain a challenging subset in interventional cardiology due to their complex anatomy and the risk of restenosis, particularly at the side-branch ostium. While provisional stenting of the main branch, with side-branch intervention only when necessary, has emerged as the preferred approach for most bifurcation lesions, the optimal technique for side-branch treatment remains uncertain [ 1 , 2 ]. Side-branch restenosis can lead to recurrent angina, ischemia, and the need for repeat revascularization, increasing procedural risks and healthcare burden.
Drug-eluting stents (DES) have reduced restenosis rates in the main branch compared to bare-metal stents; however, side-branch ostial restenosis remains a major concern. To address this, various two-stent techniques, including crush, culotte, and T-stenting, have been developed [ 3 ]. However, these approaches present specific technical challenges.

The crush technique carries a higher risk of stent malapposition, culotte stenting requires multiple rewiring steps, making it more complex, and T-stenting can result in incomplete ostial coverage, increasing the likelihood of restenosis. Studies comparing complex two-stent techniques with provisional stenting have generally shown similar or superior outcomes with the simpler provisional approach, particularly in terms of major adverse cardiac events (MACE), procedural time, and reduced risk of peri-procedural complications [ 4 - 6 ].
Recent research has focused on optimizing the provisional approach through adjunctive techniques, such as proximal optimization (POT) and kissing balloon inflation, which enhances stent apposition and side-branch patency [ 7 ].

Additionally, there is growing interest in drug-eluting balloons (DEBs) as an alternative to side-branch stenting in bifurcation lesions. This strategy delivers antiproliferative agents without placing a permanent scaffold, potentially reducing restenosis and preserving future intervention options [ 8 ]. Early studies have shown promising results with DCB use in small vessels and in-stent restenosis; however, data on de novo bifurcation lesions are limited [ 9 , 10 ].
Ongoing trials are evaluating the current evidence comparing DCBs with provisional stenting strategies for bifurcation lesions based on short-term angiographic and clinical outcomes. As the complexity of the treated lesions increases, a tailored approach based on individual anatomy may be necessary to achieve optimal results in bifurcation interventions.

DEBs versus stenting for provisional bifurcation lesions require a comprehensive understanding of historical developments, key concepts, and clinical challenges [ 11 ].
This study aimed to assess the short-term outcomes of these approaches and to explore their potential implications for future practice. In this prospective cohort study, patients with bifurcation lesions treated with DEBs and provisional stenting were evaluated based on the incidence of MACE, including restenosis, target lesion revascularization (TLR), myocardial infarction (MI), stent thrombosis, and death.

However, short-term follow-up assessments were conducted at one and three months post-intervention to capture the early incidence of MACE. While the study duration was one year, the primary focus was on short-term outcomes. After the intervention, all patients were put on dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) comprising aspirin, clopidogrel, and high-intensity statins. Furthermore, other medications were prescribed depending on the needs of the patient. Follow-up assessments were conducted at one and three months post-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to capture the peak incidence of MACE and assess treatment adherence.
To ensure a comprehensive follow-up, patients were contacted through in-person visits, telephone communication, and electronic message reminders, with remote consultations offered to those experiencing transportation limitations.

Study population and sample size
Fifty participants were divided into 2 equal cohorts: 25 were treated with DEBs and 25 were treated with stents. Using OpenRCT, the sample size was calculated with a 95% confidence level, 80% statistical power, and an anticipated outcome difference of 20% between cohorts.
Inclusion criteria
The study included patients who met the specific inclusion criteria. Participants were required to be at least 18 years old and have a confirmed diagnosis of stable angina or acute coronary syndrome (ACS) necessitating PCI. Moreover, patients were required to present with non-left main distal bifurcation lesions involving the main vessel and one or more side branches, excluding those classified as complex bifurcation lesions based on “Definition Criteria”.

Additionally, the lesions were required to be amenable to DEB treatment, wherein side-branch stenting could be avoided or deemed unnecessary.
Exclusion criteria
Patients with specific conditions were excluded from this study. This study included individuals with non-bifurcation or complex bifurcation lesions that necessitated stenting. Patients with severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) were excluded due to the increased risk of contrast-induced nephropathy and poorer post-PCI outcomes, which could confound the evaluation of MACE rates. Furthermore, patients with severe comorbidities, pregnant women, or those with contraindications to antiplatelet therapy were deemed ineligible for participation.

Treatment protocols
In the stenting group, provisional stenting was performed in the main vessel while the side branch remained untreated via percutaneous coronary angioplasty (POBA). To optimize bifurcation, kissing balloon inflation was performed as needed. The decision to perform kissing balloon inflation was made at the operator’s discretion based on anatomical indications.
In the DEB group, neither side branch POBA nor kissing balloon inflation was performed. DEBs were used to deliver antiproliferative agents to the vessel wall to reduce restenosis without the placement of a permanent scaffold.

Bleeding incidents were classified according to the Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) criteria (grades 2, 3, and 5). Events were adjudicated based on hospital records, clinical examination findings during follow-up visits, and standardized patient-reported outcomes obtained via telephone or electronic consultations. Any ambiguous cases were reviewed by the clinical team to ensure consistency.

Results
In this prospective cohort study, 50 (100%) patients with bifurcation lesions were enrolled and equally assigned to two groups: 25 (50%) treated with DEBs and 25 (50%) treated with provisional stenting. Short-term clinical outcomes were assessed based on the incidence of MACE, including restenosis, TLR, MI, stent thrombosis, and mortality while accounting for various demographic baselines (Table 1 ).

This table presents the baseline demographics of the two study groups: the DEB group (n = 25) and the stenting group (n = 25). The absence of statistically significant differences between the two groups across all demographic parameters (p > 0.05) suggests that the groups were comparable in terms of baseline characteristics. This comparability ensures an unbiased assessment of outcomes between the two intervention strategies.

In the DEB group, treatment was successfully completed without the need for side-branch stenting or kissing balloon inflation. The stenting group demonstrated comparable procedural success; however, additional interventions, including side-branch management, increased the procedural complexity.
Discussion
The findings of this study provide significant insights into the short-term outcomes of DEBs versus stenting for provisional bifurcation lesions.

Beyond preventing restenosis, DAPT plays a crucial role in stabilizing vulnerable plaques and reducing thrombotic events while high-intensity statins contribute to plaque stabilization and exert anti-inflammatory effects. These pharmacological benefits likely contributed to the low rates of MACE observed in both groups, reinforcing their comparable safety profiles. These results align with previous research emphasizing the critical role of pharmacological management in PCI. Although the overall incidence of MACE was marginally lower in the DEB group (two (8%) vs. three (12%)), this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.58). These findings are consistent with existing literature, suggesting that DEBs and stents demonstrate comparable short-term efficacy for certain bifurcation lesions [ 14 ].

The observed restenosis and TLR rates were slightly higher in the stenting group, suggesting a potential advantage of DEBs in minimizing restenosis due to the absence of a permanent scaffold. Without a metal scaffold, DEBs reduce the risk of neointimal hyperplasia, particularly benefiting patients with small vessel diameters or those at high risk for restenosis such as individuals with diabetes or diffuse coronary disease. However, the limited sample size and lack of statistical significance (p > 0.05) necessitate a cautious interpretation of these findings. In larger studies, these numerical differences may reach statistical significance, underscoring the need for further research to validate these preliminary observations.

The comparable incidence of myocardial infarction (1 (4%)) in both groups and the absence of stent thrombosis or mortality indicate the overall short-term safety of both strategies. The absence of stent thrombosis and mortality may reflect the small sample size and short follow-up period, which limit the ability to detect rare or late-onset events. Extended follow-up is necessary to capture these outcomes, as complications like late stent thrombosis often occur beyond the initial months post-intervention. However, the increased procedural complexity associated with stenting, particularly regarding side branch management, underscores the potential technical advantages of DEBs in select cases.

PMC11882106,PMC11882106_chunk_18,"including major bleeding, in both groups suggests that both DEB and stenting are safe treatment options for patients with bifurcation lesions. Similarly, the comparable rates of minor bleeding and dyspnea reinforce the equivalent safety profiles of the two interventions. No statistically significant differences were observed between the DEB and stenting groups for any adverse event category (p > 0.05).
Despite these findings, the study's limited sample size and relatively short follow-up period constrain its ability to detect rare events and assess long-term outcomes, such as late restenosis or chronic adverse events. Further studies with larger cohorts and extended follow-up durations are necessary to confirm these results.

Studies have demonstrated that conservative provisional side-branch intervention strategies yield similar or superior long-term clinical outcomes compared to more aggressive approaches [ 2 , 16 ]. The conservative strategy has been associated with lower rates of procedure-related myocardial necrosis and target vessel failure at three years of follow-up [ 16 ]. However, some studies have reported contradictory findings. For instance, Chen et al. (2017) reported that the double-kissing crush stenting technique was associated with lower TLR rates compared to provisional stenting at five years of follow-up, particularly in complex bifurcation lesions [ 11 ]. In contrast, Ferenc et al. (2008) found no significant difference in restenosis rates between routine and provisional T-stenting approaches.

While DES are commonly used in bifurcation interventions, the provided literature contains limited data on drug-eluting balloons in this context [ 5 ]. Burzotta et al. (2011) compared different types of DES (sirolimus-eluting vs. everolimus-eluting) in bifurcation lesions and found similar procedural performance but improved side-branch outcomes with everolimus-eluting stents. In summary, while provisional stenting has demonstrated favorable outcomes in bifurcation lesions, there remains a lack of direct comparisons with drug-eluting balloons in the existing literature [ 17 ].

Study limitations and future directions
A key limitation of this study is its relatively small sample size (50 patients), which may impact the generalizability of the findings. While the results suggest comparable short-term efficacy and safety between DEBs and stenting, larger multicenter studies are required to validate these outcomes in broader patient populations.
Conclusions
Our findings suggest that drug-eluting balloons (DEBs) demonstrated comparable short-term efficacy and safety to provisional stenting in bifurcation lesions. However, due to the limited sample size and short follow-up period, definitive conclusions regarding non-inferiority cannot be made.

The DEB group showed a similar safety profile and efficacy compared to the stenting group, with a non-significant trend toward lower rates of restenosis and target lesion revascularization (TLR).
These findings indicate that DEBs may be a viable treatment option for selected bifurcation lesions, offering the potential benefit of reduced procedural complexity by avoiding permanent scaffold placement and minimizing the need for side-branch interventions. While this study suggests that both DEBs and stenting are effective therapeutic modalities for managing provisional bifurcation lesions, the simplified procedural approach associated with DEBs may make them preferable in certain patient subsets. However, to validate these preliminary findings and assess long-term outcomes, including late restenosis and stent thrombosis, larger multicenter studies with extended follow-up are warranted.

PMC11905749,PMC11905749_chunk_1,"Introduction
Several randomized clinical trials have suggested that the strategy of short duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) up to 1–3 months followed by P2Y 12 inhibitor monotherapy reduced major bleeding events without increasing cardiovascular events after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). 1–5 However, the procedural complexity of PCI has been acknowledged as a determinant for cardiovascular events, and short DAPT compared with prolonged DAPT has been reported to increase the risk of cardiovascular events after complex PCI. 6 On the other hand, another study showed that P2Y 12 inhibitor monotherapy after very short DAPT compared with standard DAPT did not increase cardiovascular events regardless of complex PCI. 7 , 8 As of now, there are no data regarding the optimal antiplatelet monotherapy after very short DAPT in patients who underwent complex PCI. Recently, 1-year results of the STOPDAPT-3 (ShorT and OPtimal Duration of Dual AntiPlatelet Therapy-3) trial repor"

Recently, 1-year results of the STOPDAPT-3 (ShorT and OPtimal Duration of Dual AntiPlatelet Therapy-3) trial reported that aspirin monotherapy compared with clopidogrel monotherapy was associated with comparable cardiovascular and bleeding outcomes beyond 1 month and up to 1 year after PCI. 9 , 10 In the present study, we conducted a pre-specified subgroup analysis stratified by complex and non-complex PCI using the 1-year follow-up data from the STOPDAPT-3 trial.
Methods
The STOPDAPT-3 ( NCT04609111 ) was a physician-initiated, prospective, multicentre, open-label, adjudicator blinded randomized clinical trial, where we compared the group of 1-month prasugrel monotherapy followed by clopidogrel monotherapy with the group of 1-month DAPT followed by aspirin monotherapy in patients planned for PCI in terms of cardiovascular and bleeding endpoints.

Patients were randomly assigned in a one-to-one fashion to the 1-month aspirin-free prasugrel monotherapy or the 1-month DAPT with aspirin and prasugrel. At 1 month (between 30 and 59 days after the index PCI), patients who had received DAPT were switched to aspirin (81–100 mg/day) monotherapy (aspirin group), and patients who had received prasugrel monotherapy were switched to clopidogrel (75 mg/day) monother"

Each group of patients were to continue the assigned antiplatelet monotherapy up to 1 year. The ethics committees in all the participating centres approved the study protocol, and informed consent was obtained from all patients.

The prevalence of the high bleeding risk by the criteria of the Academic Research Consortium was higher in patients with complex PCI than in those without. Procedural characteristics were largely different between patients with and without complex PCI. The rate of intracoronary imaging use was >90% regardless of complex PCI. In terms of medications, total heparin dose during the index PCI was slightly higher in patients with complex PCI than in those without.

The main findings in the present study were as follows: (i) The effect of aspirin monotherapy relative to clopidogrel monotherapy beyond 1 month and up to 1 year was not significant for cardiovascular events regardless of complex PCI, but there was a significant interaction between complex PCI and the effect of aspirin monotherapy relative to clopidogrel monotherapy for cardiovascular events due to numerically lower risk o"

(ii) The effect of aspirin monotherapy relative to clopidogrel monotherapy beyond 1 month and up to 1 year was not significant for bleeding events regardless of complex PCI without significant interaction.
The European Society of Cardiology and the Japanese Circulation Society guidelines have suggested that complex PCI is a risk factor of stent-driven recurrent ischaemic events. 11 , 12 Indeed, patients with complex PCI had higher incidence of cardiovascular events compared with those without in the overall 1-year analysis in the present study.

More recently, Gragnano et al. 7 showed that P2Y 12 inhibitor (ticagrelor, prasugrel, or clopidogrel) monotherapy after very short DAPT (1–3 months) compared with standard DAPT was not associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events after complex PCI in the individual patient data-level meta-analysis of five randomized clinical trials. In addition, the subgroup analysis of the STOPDAPT-2 Total Cohort (ShorT and OPtimal Duration of Dual AntiPlatelet Therapy-2 Total Cohort) showed that clopidogrel monotherapy after 1-month DAPT compared with standard DAPT was not associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events regardless of co"

Indeed, the HOST-EXAM (HOST-EXtended Antiplatelet Monotherapy) trial demonstrated that clopidogrel monotherapy reduced cardiovascular events compared with aspirin monotherapy in patients with chronic phase after PCI. 16 The 5-year follow-up of the STOPDAPT-2 trial also showed that clopidogrel monotherapy was associated with numerically lower risk of cardiovascular events compared with aspirin monotherapy beyond 1 year after PCI. 17 Moreover, in an individual patient data-level meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials comparing P2Y 12 inhibitor monotherapy with aspirin monotherapy in patients with coro"

In the present study, the incidence of cardiovascular events beyond 1 month and up to 1 year was not different between aspirin monotherapy and clopidogrel monotherapy regardless of complex PCI.

Aspirin monotherapy might be an attractive regimen after stopping short DAPT in patients undergoing complex PCI. However, the positive interaction in the present study should be interpreted with cautious, because the positive interaction was derived from a small subgroup and the results in the entire study population of the 1-year analysis of the STOPDAPT-3 trial were neutral. 10 In addition, the result in the 1-year analysis of the STOPDAPT-3 trial was not consistent with the previous studies comparing P2Y 12 inhibitor monotherapy with aspirin monotherapy conducted in the chronic phase after PCI. 16 , 17 Further studies would be warranted to evaluate the optimal antiplatelet monotherapy after short DAPT in patients who underwent complex PCI.

The previous studies reported that patients undergoing complex PCI had higher incidence of bleeding events compared with those undergoing non-complex PCI. 6–8 The incidence of bleeding events was higher in patients with complex PCI than in those without complex PCI in the 30-day landmark analysis in the present study. In the main analysis of the 1-year results of the STOPDAPT-3, the incidence of major bleeding was not different between aspirin monotherapy and clopidogrel monotherapy, which was consistent with the trials conducted in the chronic phase after PCI such as the 5-year results of the STOPDAPT-2 and an individual patient data-level meta-analysis. 10 , 17 , 18 In the present study, the incidence of major bleeding was also not different between aspirin monotherapy relative to clopidogrel monotherapy regardless of complex PCI without significant interaction.

In the HOST-EXAM trial, clopidogrel monotherapy was associated with lower incidence of major bleeding compared with aspirin monotherapy. 16 The higher prescription rate of proton pump inhibitors in the STOPDAPT-3 trial compared with the HOST-EXAM trial might be one of the reasons to cancel out the benefit of clopidogrel over aspirin in reducing bleeding events. To reduce bleeding events after complex PCI, further studies would be needed to evaluate optimal antiplatelet monotherapy and to explore the necessity of prophylactic use of proton pump inhibitors in patients taking P2Y 12 inhibitor or aspirin monotherapy.

The effect of aspirin monotherapy relative to clopidogrel monotherapy beyond 1 month and up to 1 year was not different for bleeding events regardless of complex PCI. The positive interaction between complex PCI and the effect of aspirin vs. clopidogrel monotherapy for cardiovascular events should be interpreted with cautious due to the neutral results in the entire study population.

ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), which accounts for approximately 30% of patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), is a clinically time-sensitive fetal condition that results from complete thrombotic occlusion of the infarct-related artery 1 , 2 . Early reperfusion by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or thrombolytic therapy is the gold standard of treatment for STEM 3 . Despite advancements in long-term survival following STEMI, patients still encounter a heightened risk of recurrent myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and mortality, particularly in the presence of additional risk factors such as diabetes and hypertension 4 . This underscores the importance of a secondary prevention strategy targeting standard modifiable cardiovascular risk factors 5 .
Lipid-lowering drugs, anti-hypertensive agents, and anti-platelet therapy are the guideline-recommended pharmacological treatments for secondary prevention in patients with STEMI 6 . "

Lipid-lowering drugs, anti-hypertensive agents, and anti-platelet therapy are the guideline-recommended pharmacological treatments for secondary prevention in patients with STEMI 6 . Despite the proven benefits of evidence-based pharmacological secondary prevention, lack of medication adherence remains a significant challenge in STEMI patients due to the complexity of multi-drug prescriptions. Previous studies have shown that adherence to pharmacotherapy was suboptimal in patients after hospital discharge for STEMI 7 , 8 , and medication non-adherence was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular hospitalizations and mortality, coronary revascularization procedures, and increased costs 9 , 10 .
Wald et al. first described the polypill strategy, which includes combined pharmaceutical components to simultaneously target major cardiovascular risk factors, for both primary and secondary prevention 11 . The concept of the polypill or fixed-dose combination (FDC) h"

The concept of the polypill or fixed-dose combination (FDC) has evolved over time to enhance medication adherence and manage CV risk factors. However, several previous studies have provided moderate evidence that the polypill can improve adherence and CV risk factor control in patients with CVD 12 - 17 . Still, there is a lack of evidence regarding the effectiveness of the polypill in patients with STEMI. Therefore, our study aimed to compare one-year medication adherence, patient satisfaction, and lipid profile control in STEMI patients treated with the polypill versus usual care.
Methods
This was an open-label, multicentric, parallel two-arm, 1:1 allocation randomized clinical trial of polypill treatment compared with usual care in patients with STEMI for 12 months in three referral hospitals (Chamran, Alzahra, and Khorshid) in Isfahan, Iran. This"

Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this was the first study to investigate medication adherence, patient satisfaction, and CV risk factor control in patients with STEMI using either a polypill or usual care for secondary prevention.

However, patients receiving polypill treatment showed higher satisfaction and better lipid profile control compared to those receiving usual care at the end of the study. Additionally, it was demonstrated that a history of CKD, a history of cerebrovascular disease, EF, WC, and in-hospital complications were independent predictors of medication adherence.
The results of our study showed that fewer than forty percent of the participants adhered to their medical treatment, and the one-year medication adherence rate was similar between the polypill and usual care groups.

The previous RCT reported significant improvement in medication adherence after 6 months in patients receiving polypills compared with patients in the usual care group (70.6 % vs 62.7%; risk ratio (95% CI): 1.13 (1.06-1.20)). At 24 months, medication adherence also increased in the polypill group more than usual care group (74.1% vs 63.2%; risk ratio (95% CI): 1.17 (1.10-1.25)) 22 .
One possible explanation for the discrepancy in our study could be the characteristics of the participants, as patients with STEMI showed lower adherence rates to optimal medication treatment for secondary prevention 23 . Additionally, the relatively low adherence rate observed in both groups in our study may be attributed to the novelty of the polypill concept in our region, which might influence patients’ acceptance of the medication.

Factors affecting the acceptance of the polypill could include personal beliefs regarding the ineffectiveness of a single pill to manage risk factors such as hyperlipidemia and hypertension, concerns about potential adverse events, and a lack of substantial evidence supporting its effectiveness in preventing cardiovascular events 24 . Furthermore, differences in the duration of follow-up and physicians’ concerns regarding the effectiveness of the polypill, which led to discontinuing its use, could explain the differences with the previous study.
In terms of patient satisfaction, our results showed that patients treated with the polypill were more satisfied than the usual care group, with significantly higher scores in the convenience and global satisfaction domains of TSQM.

Our findings regarding patient satisfaction align with those of a comparative study evaluating satisfaction levels between a cardiovascular polypill and separate pills. The study demonstrated a significantly higher degree of satisfaction with polypill therapy, and a high proportion of patients receiving the individual components stated that they would prefer the polypill 17 .

The likelihood of medication adherence was higher in patients with in-hospital complications such as atrial tachyarrhythmia and bleeding. It appears that patients who experience complications during their hospital stay are more likely to accept prescribed medication. This is because they want to reduce the risk of re-hospitalization and prevent the recurrence of adverse events.

Introduction
Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute systemic vasculitis of unknown cause that mainly occurs in childhood and was first reported in Japan by Tomisaku Kawasaki in 1967 ( 1 ).

PMC11921228,PMC11921228_chunk_2,"in Japan by Tomisaku Kawasaki in 1967 ( 1 ). It is a syndrome caused by inflammation mainly in the medium-sized arteries with characteristic clinical symptoms, including fever, rash, eye redness, lip and tongue redness, swelling of the hands and feet, and cervical lymphadenitis ( 2 , 3 ). Treatment consists of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and oral aspirin, which has an 80% efficacy rate. However, a serious complication of KD is coronary artery aneurysm (CAA), which occurs in 7–8% of patients and persists for more than 1 month after onset in 2–3% of cases ( 3 , 4 ). Patients with giant coronary artery aneurysms (GAs; i.e., aneurysms ≥8 mm in diameter or coronary artery Z-score ≥10) are at high risk of cardiovascular events (CEs), particularly myocardial infarction and heart failure, and require lifelong treatment ( 5 ).
In Japan, where KD was first recognized and treated, at least 272,000 people were estimated to have KD by the end of 2010, 117,000 of whom had reached adulthood ( 6"

In Japan, where KD was first recognized and treated, at least 272,000 people were estimated to have KD by the end of 2010, 117,000 of whom had reached adulthood ( 6 ). Nationwide surveys in Japan have investigated deaths from coronary sequelae of KD in young adults in detail ( 7 , 8 ). A questionnaire-based survey of 644 hospitals across Japan in 2010–2011 identified 67 deaths in patients who were judged to have had KD in childhood. In these patients, death occurred at a median interval of 16 years after the acute phase and the culprit lesion was characterized by aneurysm ≥6 mm in the acute KD and giant aneurysm in the long-term ( 8 ). KD patients with GA have the highest risk of CEs ( 5 , 8 - 10 ). Antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapies are used in these patients, but there is insufficient evidence to guide their dosage and duration ( 3 , 4 , 11 ).

Since 1998, we have been treating KD patients with GAs using a uniform antithrombotic protocol at our facility in Chiba Prefecture, Japan. In this retrospective study, we examined the status of GAs and their treatment and outcomes in order to evaluate our antithrombotic treatment protocol and add some evidence regarding the long-term management for KD with GA, and it is hoped that this work will provide insights for the management of adult KD patients with GA. We present this article in accordance with the STROBE reporting checklist (available at https://cdt.amegroups.com/article/view/10.21037/cdt-24-289/rc ).
Methods
The medical records at Chiba University Hospital were retrospectively searched to identify patients with a diagnosis of KD and GA who were treated in the acute phase of KD between 1999 and 2013. GA was defined as a coronary artery diameter of ≥8 mm ( 3 , 11 , 12 ). Modera"

GA was defined as a coronary artery diameter of ≥8 mm ( 3 , 11 , 12 ). Moderate CAA was defined as a coronary artery diameter of ≥4 and <8 mm, and small CAA was defined as a coronary artery diameter of ≥3 and <4 mm. The maximum diameter in the acute phase was recorded by echocardiography and coronary angiography. Coronary artery Z-scores were computed using a calculator based on data for Japanese children ( 13 ). Patients who declined to participate in this research in writing and those deemed unsuitable for inclusion in the opinion of the principal investigator were excluded.
The following data were obtained from the medical records: age at onset of KD, date of treatment initiation for KD, results of laboratory tests, details of treatment, details of antithrombotic therapy, date of resolution of fever, date of CAA development, site(s) of GA, CEs, and death. CEs we"

CEs were defined as myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, and asymptomatic myocardial infarction. Asymptomatic myocardial infarction was diagnosed by electrocardiographic evidence of ischemic change at the time of routine evaluation in the outpatient department. Seven patients had CEs (event group) and 9 did not (non-event group).
Our antithrombotic protocol for patients with KD and CAA is as follows. We consider pyrexia to have resolved when the patient’s temperature remained below 37.5 ℃ for 48 h. We then reduce the aspirin dose from 30–50 to 3–5 mg/kg/day. Continuous intravenous heparin is started when the diameter of a CAA is ≥6 mm and then switched to oral warfarin when laboratory tests confirm that the inflammatory response has resolved and the aneurysm has stopped dilating (phase 1).

The warfarin dose is determined by a target prothrombin time-international normalized ratio (PT-INR) of 2.0–2.5 on coagulation tests. Patients with no CEs or findings of thrombosis in the first 2–3 years of the illness (phase 2) are considered for discontinuation of warfarin and continuation on aspirin alone (phase 3).
Initial coronary angiography is performed when coronary arteritis is judged to have subsided, which is typically around 3 months after onset of KD. A second coronary angiogram is performed 1 year after onset of KD.

In the event group, 1 patient experienced fatal myocardial infarction and 3 underwent coronary artery bypass grafting. Three patients had CEs in phase 1, 2 had CEs in phase 2, and 2 had CEs in phase 3 ( Table 2 ). Four events occurred when the prothrombin time was poorly controlled. Case 7 had a myocardial infarction 3 months after discontinuation of warfarin ( Table 2 ).

Discussion
In this study, the incidence of CEs was 44% in 16 KD patients with GA on antithrombotic therapy over a median of 5.8 years. A recent systematic review of studies that have investigated the prognosis of CAA in KD reported that 10-year survival ranged from 92% to 99% and 10-year major adverse CE-free survival ranged from 66% to 91% ( 14 ). That report included all sizes of CAA. The 10-year survival rate for patients with GA was reported to be 94–99% and 10-year CE-free survival to be 58–71% at 10 years ( 9 ). In terms of the prognosis, our results are comparable with those previously reported. However, the incidence of 44% for CEs is still very high, and we believe our treatment protocol is unsatisfactory and needs to "
PMC11921228,PMC11921228_chunk_15,"he prognosis, our results are comparable with those previously reported. However, the incidence of 44% for CEs is still very high, and we believe our treatment protocol is unsatisfactory and needs to be improved. In our antithrombotic protocol, anticoagulation was discontinued after 2 or 4 years if a patient had no CEs, regardless of the morphology or number of CAAs. By evaluating this protocol, this work provides evidence that can contribute to establishing discontinuation criteria.
The first step needed to improve management of patients with GA is strict control of prothrombin time. Three of our patients who experienced CEs had a low prothrombin time of 1.0–1.5 at the time of the event. It is important to counsel patients and families about the high risk of CEs, increase patient adherence, and adjust the dosage of medication appropriately.

PMC11921228,PMC11921228_chunk_16,"e, and adjust the dosage of medication appropriately. The second step is the therapeutic option of adding another antiplatelet agent. Dual antiplatelet therapy has been recommended for adults with coronary vascular disease ( 15 - 17 ). However, the risk of bleeding is expected to be increased, and large-scale trials are difficult to conduct in KD patients with CAA, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions.
The maximum Z-score during follow-up was significantly larger in the group with CE. A prognostic study of 209 Japanese patients with KD and GA reported a significantly greater maximum Z-score in the group with CE ( 10 ). In the present study, all patients with CEs had a maximum Z-score of ≥14 and those without CEs had a wide distribution of maximum Z-scores ranging from 9.3 to 19.7.
Our results suggest that the presence of GAs in multiple branches is associated with a high risk of CEs, which is in line with the findings of a study by Tsuda et al. ( 9 ). They reported that CEs wer"
PMC11921228,PMC11921228_chunk_17,"Our results suggest that the presence of GAs in multiple branches is associated with a high risk of CEs, which is in line with the findings of a study by Tsuda et al. ( 9 ). They reported that CEs were significantly more common in patients with GAs in multiple branches than in those with GA in a single branch. Furthermore, potentially good collateral arteries may develop more easily in patients with unilateral GA than in those with bilateral GA ( 9 , 18 ). This finding is important in terms of treatment decision-making in both the early and late stages. Optimal treatment by coronary artery bypass grafting could be considered, especially in patients with bilateral GA.
This study has several limitations. First, the sample size was small, and the follow-up duration was relatively short. However, our findings are consistent with those of previous studies that included larger numbers of patients with longer follow-up. Second, the study was conducted in 2013–2014.

Second, the study was conducted in 2013–2014. The treatment guidelines were revised in the US in 2017 and in Japan in 2020 ( 3 , 4 ). The latest guidelines for KD recommend continued anticoagulation for the most severe cases of CAA, including GA, which is supported by our results.
Conclusions
In this case series, the prognosis of KD with GA was unsatisfactory in patients treated using our protocol of anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy, especially in those with large and multiple GAs. We recommend continuation of strict anticoagulation therapy in addition to antiplatelet therapy in these patients.

RESULTS
Among 5438 patients enrolled in the HOST‐EXAM trial from March 26, 2014, to May 29, 2018, full data to calculate the eGFR were available in 4844 patients (Figures S1 ). The mean eGFR in the entire population was 89.4±19.5 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 , and 508 (10.5%) patients had CKD (defined as eGFR <60 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 ).

Baseline characteristics according to the presence of CKD are presented in Table S1 . Patients with CKD were older and more likely to be women, to be a current smoker, and to have a higher prevalence of various comorbidities including diabetes, insulin‐dependent diabetes, and hypertension. Patients with CKD were likely to have a history of cardiovascular accident, left main disease, and multivessel disease. The baseline characteristics according to the randomized antiplatelet treatment within the CKD and non‐CKD groups are presented in Table 1 . The baseline characteristics were well balanced between the clopidogrel and aspirin groups with no significant differences.

During the study period of 24 months, the cumulative incidence of the primary end point was significantly higher in the CKD group compared with the non‐CKD group (11.7% versus 6.0%; hazard ratio [HR], 2.01 [95% CI, 1.51–2.67; P <0.001; log‐rank]; P <0.001; Figure 1A ).

After adjustment for differences in clinical characteristics, results were similar and consistent with that of the univariable analysis (Table S2 ).

The association between continuous eGFR values and the risk of clinical events is shown in Figure S3 . The risk of clinical events significantly increased as eGFR decreased (adjusted HR for the primary end point per 10 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 decrease in eGFR: 1.09 [95% CI, 1.03–1.16]; adjusted HR for the thrombotic end point per 10 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 decrease in eGFR: 1.08 [95% CI, 1.01–1.17]; adjusted HR for any bleeding per 10 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 decrease in eGFR: 1.12 [95% CI, 1.03–1.23]).

In the non‐CKD group, the incidence of the primary end point was 7.0% and 5.1% in the aspirin and clopidogrel arms, respectively (HR, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.56–0.91]; P =0.007). The number needed to treat for clopidogrel over aspirin to prevent 1 primary end point was 33 for the CKD group and 50 for the non‐CKD group. There was no significant interaction between the treatment effect and the presence of CKD ( P for interaction=0.889; Figure 2A ).

No significant interactions were found between CKD status and treatment effects of any of the other outcomes (all P for interaction>0.10; Table 2 ). The per‐protocol analyses yielded similar results to the intention‐to‐treat analyses for the primary end point and the secondary end points (Table S3 ).

The association between continuous eGFR values and the risk of clinical events is shown in Figure S3 . The risk of clinical events significantly increased as eGFR decreased (adjusted HR for the primary end point per 10 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 decrease in eGFR: 1.09 [95% CI, 1.03–1.16]; adjusted HR for the thrombotic end point per 10 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 decrease in eGFR: 1.08 [95% CI, 1.01–1.17]; adjusted HR for any bleeding per 10 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 decrease in eGFR: 1.12 [95% CI, 1.03–1.23]).
Clinical Outcomes According to the Antiplatelet Strategy in the CKD and Non‐ CKD Groups
Within the CKD group, the primary end point occurred in 13.4% (32 patients) in the aspirin arm and 10.1% (26 patients) in the clopidogrel arm (HR, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.44–1.25]; P =0.264). In the non‐CKD group, the incidence of t"

In the non‐CKD group, the incidence of the primary end point was 7.0% and 5.1% in the aspirin and clopidogrel arms, respectively (HR, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.56–0.91]; P =0.007). The number needed to treat for clopidogrel over aspirin to prevent 1 primary end point was 33 for the CKD group and 50 for the non‐CKD group. There was no significant interaction between the treatment effect and the presence of CKD ( P for interaction=0.889; Figure 2A ).

DISCUSSION
In this post hoc analysis of the HOST‐EXAM trial, we studied whether the beneficial effects of clopidogrel over aspirin during the chronic maintenance monotherapy following PCI is consistent in patients with CKD. Our principal findings are as follows: (1) Patients with CKD have a higher incidence of both thrombotic and bleeding events than those patients without CKD; and (2) there was no difference in the treatment effect of clopidogrel monotherapy according to CKD status and degree of renal function.
The proportion of patients with CKD undergoing PCI is increasing due to the high prevalence of coronary artery disease in these patients, an aging society, and increasing incidence of comorbidities including diabetes, hypertension, and obesity. 4 , 8 , 9 , 10 There are few clinical trials comparing post‐PCI pharmacotherapy in patients with CK"

In the PROMETHEUS (Prasugrel or Clopidogrel in Patients With Acute Coronary Syndromes at High Thrombotic Risk) study, CKD was significantly associated with a higher risk for both major adverse cardiac events and bleeding events at 1 year. 15 Our study showed similar results where CKD was an independent risk factor for not only the primary end point, a composite of both ischemic and bleeding outcomes but also each thrombotic end point and any bleeding events.

Among various thrombotic events, CKD was associated with a higher risk of cardiac death and all cause death, which are the most fatal outcomes. In particular, CKD showed a strong association with cardiac death, even after other covariates were adjusted. Also, cardiac death accounted for nearly half of all‐cause deaths (11/23) in patients with CKD, while cardiac death accounted for only about a quarter of all‐cause deaths (13/51) in patients without CKD. These findings are consistent with previous studies. A subgroup analysis of the EVENT (Evaluation of Drug‐Eluting Stents and Ischemic Events) registry assessed 1‐year outcomes following PCI with drug‐eluting stents according to renal function. 16 In this study, there was an increase in fatal outcomes including cardiac death and myocardial infarction with decreasing creatinine clearance.

In another study, the risk of death and myocardial infarction increased with worsening renal function, but the risk of target‐vessel revascularization did not show a significant association with renal function. 14 In addition, deteriorating renal function was associated with higher risk of adverse clinical events not only when patients were divided into CKD and non‐CKD groups but also when analyzed in 3 groups according to the degree of renal dysfunction (normal, mild, and moderate to severe renal dysfunction) and when analyzed on the basis of continuous eGFR value.

Antiplatelet agents are one of the most important medications to prevent adverse events in patients with coronary artery disease. Since patients who undergo PCI are indicated for lifelong antiplatelet therapy, finding the optimal agent is especially important. 17 Among various antiplatelet agents, aspirin and clopidogrel have been used for a long time in patients with cardiovascular disease risk. However, there was no study comparing the traditionally used aspirin and clopidogrel as proper monotherapy during chronic maintenance period in patients who underwent coronary stenting before HOST‐EXAM trial. 5 Although the CAPRIE (Clopidogrel Versus Aspirin in Patients at Risk of Ischemic Events) trial showed that clopidogrel was more effective than aspirin in reducing major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with atherosclerotic vascular "

The effect of antiplatelet drugs could be influenced by change in renal function because platelet function and the enzymatic coagulation cascade can be affected by renal function. 1 , 3 , 4 Combined with thrombogenic and bleeding characteristics in patients with CKD, it is difficult to predict the final effect of antiplatelet agents adjusted by the impaired renal function.

For example, the CKD substudy of the CREDO (Clopidogrel for the Reduction of Events During Observation) trial showed that clopidogrel reduced the risk of thrombotic events in patients with normal renal function but not in those with mild to moderate CKD. 19 Therefore, it is important to study whether the benefits seen in the main trial are consistent and sustained in patients with CKD or those with renal dysfunction.
In our substudy, the clopidogrel arm had numerically lower rates of adverse outcomes including the primary composite end point, thrombotic composite end point, and any bleeding compared with the aspirin arm in both the CKD and non‐CKD groups.

Although the difference did not reach statistical significance, there was no significant interaction between the treatment effect and CKD status for any of the outcomes. These results were similar in the per‐protocol analysis. Furthermore, when patients were divided into 3 groups according to degree of renal dysfunction (eGFR ≥90, 60–90, and <60 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 ), there was no significant difference in the treatment effects of clopidogrel over aspirin across the 3 groups.
While our conventional frequentist analysis showed no statistical difference in treatment effects of clopidogrel over aspirin according to renal function, it may be worthwhile to understand to what extent clopidogrel is beneficial in each renal function group. Due to the innate limitations of subgroups analyses, it may be challenging to precisely determine this.

Recently, the COMPASS (Cardiovascular Outcomes for People Using Anticoagulation Strategies) trial has demonstrated that dual pathway inhibition with low‐dose rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice daily) and aspirin compared with aspirin alone showed better cardiovascular outcomes (a composite of cardiovascular death, stroke, or myocardial infarction) in patients with stable cardiovascular disease at the cost of an increased risk in major bleeding. 20 Our findings of lower bleeding when using clopidogrel over aspirin could open the possibility of dual pathway inhibition using clopidogrel instead of aspirin. Of course, it is unknown how rivaroxaban will interact with clopidogrel, and further studies will be necessary to test whether this could be a "

Of course, it is unknown how rivaroxaban will interact with clopidogrel, and further studies will be necessary to test whether this could be a feasible option for secondary prevention in patients with high ischemic risk.
This study has several limitations. First, the randomization in HOST‐EXAM trial was not stratified by CKD status, and it may cause some imbalance between the randomized groups among patients with CKD. Second, due to the limitation of subgroup analysis, the CKD group was underpowered to draw any definitive conclusions on the superior effect of clopidogrel over aspirin on clinical outcomes. Therefore, our results should be interpreted carefully and considered hypothesis generating at best. Third, we used the baseline renal function to define CKD, and thus any changes in renal function over the study period were not incorporated in the analysis.

Fourth, the prognostic value of continuous eGFR in each clopidogrel and aspirin group could not be investigated due to the limited number of patients with CKD. We will require further studies in a dedicated CKD population to determine the optimal chronic maintenance antiplatelet strategy in CKD patients undergoing PCI.

Antiplatelet treatment is a cornerstone in the management of patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), effectively reducing the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events. Aspirin, the most common antiplatelet agent, acts by inhibiting the production of thromboxane, a molecule responsible for platelet aggregation and thrombus formation. Aspirin is widely available without a prescription, typically as 300 mg tablets, and is commonly used as an anti-inflammatory drug for minor aches, pains, and fever reduction. Low-dose aspirin (usually 75 mg) is widely used in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular prevention, helping to reduce the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and blood clots in high-risk individuals. In addition, aspirin is used in obstetric care to prevent complications such as pre-eclampsia in pregnant women at elevated risk [ 1 ].

Antiplatelet drugs are recommended for the secondary prevention of cardio- and cerebrovascular disease. However, its role in primary prevention remains controversial and challenging to define [ 2 , 3 , 4 ]. This controversy arises from the delicate balance between its modest cardiovascular benefits and the potential for serious adverse events, particularly bleeding complications. Contemporary meta-analyses have demonstrated that while aspirin use in primary prevention may yield a small reduction in cardiovascular events, the accompanying increase in bleeding risk often outweighs the benefits, resulting in an uncertain net clinical benefit [ 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 ].
For primary prevention, these drugs are advised only in patients at very high risk but are not mandatory, as the balance between risk and benefit remains unsettled. In older individuals, the age-related risk of bleeding necessitates a "

In older individuals, the age-related risk of bleeding necessitates a careful risk/benefit evaluation before prescribing antiplatelet drugs, whether for primary or secondary cardiovascular prevention [ 11 ].
In light of these findings, the guidelines from major cardiovascular societies have taken a cautious stance. The 2019 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines recommend the infrequent use of aspirin in individuals without established ASCVD, given the lack of a clear net benefit [ 12 ]. Similarly, the ESC guidelines for cardiovascular disease prevention advise against the routine use of antiplatelet therapy in individuals with low or moderate cardiovascular risk due to concerns over major bleeding, assigning a class III recommendation with level A evidence [ 2 ].

These positions underscore the need for a more nuanced, patient-centered approach to aspirin therapy in primary prevention, taking into account the individual risk factors for both cardiovascular events and bleeding.
Personalized medicine approaches, integrating tools such as risk stratification scores and biomarker profiles, may help refine the identification of patients most likely to benefit from antiplatelet therapy [ 13 ]. However, real-world data on this issue remain limited.
To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a post hoc analysis of the VITAL (VITamins and Lifestyle) cohort data, aiming to evaluate whether findings from randomized controlled trials regarding aspirin use are applicable to broader, non-trial populations.

3. Results
Out of the 25,871 individuals enrolled in the VITAL study, 25,497 participants provided data on baseline aspirin use, while 394 individuals did not report such information. Among those who reported baseline aspirin use, 13,927 individuals did not use aspirin at baseline, whereas 11,570 individuals reported using aspirin at baseline ( Figure 1 ).
The characteristics of the group of patients taking aspirin included age, sex, body mass index (BMI), race, smoking habits, and comorbidities ( Table 1 ). The aspirin users’ mean age was 67.5 years (vs. 65.9 years in non-users, p < 0.001), 54.7% we"

The aspirin users’ mean age was 67.5 years (vs. 65.9 years in non-users, p < 0.001), 54.7% were male (vs. 45.1%, p < 0.001), and the mean BMI value was higher in aspirin users with 28.4 kg/m 2 compared with a mean BMI of 27.8 kg/m 2 in non-users ( p < 0.001). The number of current smokers amongst aspirin users was lower compared with aspirin non-users (6.2% versus 8.0%, p < 0.001). At baseline, 58.5% of aspirin users had arterial hypertension treated with medication, significantly higher compared with aspirin non-users (42.1%, p < 0.001). The aspirin users with diabetes mellitus were more frequent (17.7%) than diabetic individuals not treated with aspirin (10.3%; p < 0.001). The usage of cholesterol-lowering medication and diabetes mellitus (DM) medication was also higher for patients under aspirin medication compared with patients who were not using aspirin ( Table 1 ).

Table 2 shows the events and incidence rates within 5.3 years of follow-up according to the use of aspirin at baseline.
In the unadjusted analysis, the aspirin group presented a higher risk of cardiovascular mortality (HR 1.30, 95%CI 1.03 to 1.64) and cardiovascular events, such as major cardiovascular events (HR 1.21, 95%CI 1.03 to 1.64), coronary heart disease (HR 1.39, 95%CI 1.19 to 1.65), and stroke (HR 1.31, 95%CI 1.03 to 1.65) ( Figure 2 ). However, after adjustingfor demographic and clinical variables, aspirin was not identified as a predictor of cardiovascular death (HR 1.17, 95%CI 0.89 to 1.55), major cardiovascular events (HR 1.04, 95%CI 0.89 to 1.22), coronary heart disease (HR 1.16, 95%CI 0.98 to 1.37), nor stroke (HR 1.01, 95%CI 0.77 to 1.31)— Figure 2 and Appendix A .

The adjusted HR for aspirin use in primary prevention varied by race/ethnicity ( Table 3 ). Among Caucasians, no significant differences were found for mortality (HR 0.86, 95%CI 0.74–1.04), CV mortality (HR 0.96, 95%CI 0.68–1.34), or MACE (HR 0.96, 95%CI 0.80–1.16). In Black participants, aspirin use was associated with a higher CV mortality (HR 2.01, 95%CI 1.10–3.68), while other outcomes were not significant. Results for Hispanic, Asian, and Native American groups were inconclusive due to wide confidence intervals or insufficient data. These findings suggest potential racial differences in aspirin’s effects, particularly in Black participants, warranting further investigation.

4. Discussion
The use of aspirin in primary prevention was not associated with the risk reduction of cardiovascular events, after adjustment for demographic and clinical characteristics, in this post hoc evaluation of the VITAL cohort data. It should be stressed that individuals with prescribed aspirin at baseline had an overall prevalence of clinical characteristics that predict a higher risk of cardiovascular events, such as increased age, male gender, higher BMI, and more frequent parental history of MI. These findings suggest that prescribing practices may have been influenced by clinicians’ perception of risk, aligning with the principles of individualized care.
It is also important to contextualize these findings within the timeframe of data collection, which occurred over a decade ago when the evidence against aspirin in primary prevention was less definitive. This underscores the need for contemporary analy"

This underscores the need for contemporary analyses that incorporate the advancements in personalized medicine, such as the integration of genetic and biomarker-based risk stratification, to guide more precise therapeutic decisions in primary prevention.
In 2009, a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials suggested that aspirin use could reduce by 12% the risk of vascular events, mainly non-fatal MI, and suggested that aspirin could even have benefits in reducing all-cause mortality [ 18 ]. However, it is plausible that these cardiovascular benefits reflected an era when cardiovascular risk factors were less effectively managed, leading to a higher relative benefit of antiplatelet therapy.

Over the past two decades, accumulating evidence has challenged the role of aspirin in primary prevention. Despite this growing evidence, a 2017 National Health Interview Survey revealed that 23.4% of individuals reported using aspirin for primary prevention, with 23% of these doing so without a physician’s recommendation [ 19 ]. So, these findings highlight not only the need for continued physician education but also the importance of managing patient expectations and beliefs about the benefits and risks of aspirin. Incorporating personalized medicine approaches, such as individualized risk stratification and shared decision-making, could help bridge the gap between clinical evidence and patient behavior, optimizing the use of aspirin in primary prevention.

The main evidence against aspirin use in primary prevention came to light in 2018 with three important trials—the ASPREE trial (older adults) [ 20 ], ASCEND trial (patients with diabetes) [ 21 ], and ARRIVE study (average-risk adults) [ 22 ]. Subsequently, systematic reviews have reached the same conclusions as our post hoc analysis in the general population, but also in specific groups of higher cardiovascular risk, such as those with diabetes or chronic kidney disease [ 6 , 7 , 8 , 23 ]. On the other hand, years after this change in paradigm, few studies still point in a different direction. For instance, Zhao et al. stated that low-dose aspirin should be considered for primary prevention in aboriginal people with high cardiovascular risk, due to reducing all-cause mortality (HR 0.45, 95%CI 0.34 to 0.60) and not significantly increasing bleeding risk (HR 1.13, 95%CI 0.39 to 3.26).

We cannot extrapolate this data from people living in remote Australia with a mean age of only 42 years old to other urbanistic and older populations [ 24 ]. This underscores the importance of personalized medicine in interpreting and applying clinical evidence.
Building on the principles of personalized medicine, it is essential to explore how factors such as race and ethnicity influence the effectiveness and safety of aspirin, shedding light on potential disparities in its cardiovascular benefits. Contrary to our results, other studies suggest that low-dose aspirin may not offer the same protective benefits for African Americans as it does for other populations. For instance, one study found that low-dose aspirin did not reduce the risk of fatal heart attacks among African Americans but showed a trend toward a decreased risk in white participants, especially women."
PMC11943274,PMC11943274_chunk_27,"stance, one study found that low-dose aspirin did not reduce the risk of fatal heart attacks among African Americans but showed a trend toward a decreased risk in white participants, especially women. Additionally, African Americans taking low-dose aspirin experienced an 18% increased risk of dying from a heart event, while non-Hispanic white participants had a 14% decreased risk [ 25 ].
These disparities may stem from genetic variations affecting aspirin metabolism, poor control of cardiovascular risk factors, and differences in adherence to aspirin regimens. The medication interactions more common in African American populations could also play a role. Moreover, African Americans have been historically underrepresented in aspirin studies, limiting the applicability of findings to this population [ 25 ].

Beyond biological factors, social and cultural influences may impact aspirin use and its outcomes. Positive peer support and cultural beliefs about aspirin have been linked to higher adoption rates in African American communities. The research in other contexts, such as cancer prevention, has also suggested that aspirin’s effects may vary across racial groups, further highlighting the need to explore these differences in cardiovascular prevention [ 26 ].
These findings underscore the importance of more inclusive research to better understand the relationship between aspirin use, race/ethnicity, and cardiovascular outcomes. Addressing these disparities can guide the development of tailored prevention strategies and improve outcomes for underrepresented populations.

PMC11943274,PMC11943274_chunk_29,"interesting topic regarding cardiovascular prevention is the great interest in simple approaches with wide applicability to address cardiovascular risk factors, including using fixed-dose combination drug regimens, also known as polypills. An individual participant data meta-analysis of three large randomized controlled trials (TIPS-3, HOPE-3, and Polylran) evaluated a fixed-dose combination strategy of at least two blood-pressure-lowering agents plus a statin with or without aspirin. The mean age of the participants was 63 ± 7.1 years old, and the estimated 10-year cardiovascular disease risk was 17.7 ± 8.7%. The group receiving fixed-dose combination strategies including aspirin had a 47% reduction (HR 0·53, 95%CI 0·41 to 0·67; number needed to treat [NNT] 37) in the primary outcome (a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or arterial revascularization), compared with a 32% reduction (HR 0·68, 95%CI 0·57 to 0·81; NNT 66) for fixed-dose combination strategi"

Regarding side effects related to aspirin, they were non-statistically different. This bundle strategy seems to be more effective in older patients (>63 years old) with high or very-high CV risk (10-year CV risk > 9.6%) [ 27 ].
Despite this interesting putative beneficial effect of polypill regimen in a subgroup of patients, the current evidence of using aspirin alone in primary prevention in the general population does not seem to overcome the bleeding risk.
While our analysis provides valuable insights into this important topic, it is not without limitations.

However, it is noteworthy that almost half of the participants had hypertension, a third were on statin therapy, and 14% were diagnosed with diabetes. These cardiovascular risk factors were well represented in the study population, and the results were independent of these factors.
Another acknowledged limitation of our analysis is its retrospective and post hoc nature. Additionally, the lack of data regarding bleeding risk presents a significant drawback, as only hemorrhagic stroke outcomes were collected, showing no differences between groups. Nevertheless, given that no net benefit was observed with antiplatelet medication in this population, the absence of detailed bleeding risk data becomes less critical in this context.

Bleeding after percutaneous coronary intervention remains a substantial clinical challenge, especially in people with acute coronary syndrome who are known to have a greater susceptibility to bleeding and ischaemic events. 1 2 The administration of antiplatelet medications is a major contributing factor to bleeding events following percutaneous coronary intervention, and providing patients with optimal antiplatelet regimens has emerged as a key treatment modifier for maximising the net clinical benefit. 2 The conventional antiplatelet regimen after treating patients with acute coronary syndrome and percutaneous coronary intervention involves dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) using aspirin in combination with a potent P2Y12 inhibitor for 12 months. 1 While this approach effectively reduces the risk of ischaemic events, patients are at a considerable risk of bleeding.

In the prespecified hierarchical testing of secondary endpoints, the first secondary endpoint in the hierarchy (clinically relevant ischaemic or bleeding event) was analysed by the win ratio approach to account for the different clinical importance within this composite endpoint. This endpoint showed that the stepwise de-escalation group was associated with significantly more wins when compared with the standard group (14.4% wins v 10.1% wins, win ratio 1.43 (95% CI 1.12 to 1.83); P=0.004, fig 3 ).

Discussion
This study provides evidence investigating a dedicated antiplatelet regimen for people treated by DCB. We found that stepwise DAPT de-escalation with one month aspirin plus ticagrelor, followed by five months of ticagrelor monotherapy and then aspirin monotherapy, was non-inferior for net adverse clinical events compared with the standard 12 months of DAPT with aspirin plus ticagrelor. Furthermore, if all clinically relevant ischaemic or bleeding events were considered and treated as having hierarchical clinical importance, an overall benefit would have been seen with stepwise DAPT de-escalation compared with standard 12 month DAPT.

Drug eluting stent is generally appropriate for all patients who require percutaneous coronary intervention, however, DCBs are often used for certain indications, as suggested in the consensus documents. 13 28 Therefore, the rates of people with high bleeding risk or small vessel disease and the number of in-stent restenosis or bifurcation lesions are higher in this cohort compared with other studies (eg, TICO, 21 T-PASS, 24 STOPDAPT-2 ACS, 26 and ULTIMATE-DAPT 25 ) that investigated DAPT de-escalation in people with acute coronary syndrome treated with drug eluting stent. However, in our study, the mean device diameter was smaller and the rate of multivessel treatment was lower.

Notably, the proportion of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in our study (17%) is lower than in these other studies, 21 24 25 26 which had rates between 27% and 40%. However, the proportion is similar to previous DCB studies: the proportion of STEMIs in the acute coronary syndrome population was 10% in the BASKET SMALL 2 study; 4 16% in the EASTBOURNE 15 registry, and 19% in the SCAAR 17 registry, whereas patients with STEMI were excluded in the AGENT IDE study. 7 The low proportion of patients with STEMI in studies involving DCBs could be explained by the fact that DCBs are generally not used in the setting of obvious angiographic thrombus, which may inhibit drug delivery to the vessel wall. 39
Notwithstanding this, the thrombotic risk for patients in the present study was similar to previous studies involving DAPT de-escalation after a drug eluting stent. In the STOPDAPT-2 ACS, 26 TICO, 21 T-PASS, 24 and ULTIMATE-DAPT 25 studies,"

In the STOPDAPT-2 ACS, 26 TICO, 21 T-PASS, 24 and ULTIMATE-DAPT 25 studies, the average number of stents used per patient was 1.4, mean device lengths ranged between 32 mm and 38 mm, and the rate of all cause death ranged between 0.7% and 1.2%. Similarly, in the present study, the average number of DCBs used per patient was 1.3, the mean device length was 33 mm, and the rate of all cause death was 1.0%. While risk scores were not reported in the TICO, T-PASS, or ULTIMATE-DAPT studies, in the STOPDAPT-2 ACS study, 16% of patients had a high (≥5) PARIS thrombotic score compared with 22% in the present study.

However, participants who were not adherent to the study protocol were also included in the intention-to-treat population. Conversely, in the per protocol analyses (more than half of the non-adherence was due to switching from ticagrelor to clopidogrel and thus not included in the per protocol population), we found no difference in patient oriented composite endpoint between the strictly ticagrelor based stepwise DAPT de-escalation group (8.1%) and the 12 month DAPT group (8.3%) (appendix).

This disparity between intention-to-treat and per protocol populations was primarily caused by the inclusion or exclusion of patients on clopidogrel based monotherapy. As such, we considered that the 1% higher risk of patient oriented composite endpoint in the intention-to-treat population might be due to the lower potency of clopidogrel based monotherapy compared with protocol-defined ticagrelor based monotherapy. 26 This finding also underscores the importance of adhering to ticagrelor to uphold the efficacy of a P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy based stepwise DAPT de-escalation approach, especially in patients with higher thrombotic risks. 40

Additionally, the selection of suitable patients or lesions for DCB treatment and subsequent procedural techniques were required to follow the recommendations of the German Consensus Group on DCB interventions 28 and the Third Report of the International DCB Consensus Group. 13 Despite the effort, however, compared with real world observational data involving DCB, the current study population was still associated with a relatively lower risk. Of note, when considering the data in daily practice, people who were deemed not suitable for a standard 12-month DAPT due to excessive bleeding risk, such as previous intracranial haemorrhage or required long term oral anticoagulant therapy, were not included.

Compared with de novo lesions, patients with in-stent restenosis were generally associated with a higher ischaemic risk. 13 29 Consequently, our study used stratified randomisation according to whether lesions were de novo or in-stent restenosis. Reassuringly, the effect of the assigned treatment on the incidences of the primary endpoints was consistent across de novo or in-stent restenosis lesion. This effect was also consistent in other prespecified subgroups with higher ischaemic risks, including diabetes, lesion in the proximal vessel, treatment of multivessel disease, complex percutaneous coronary intervention, and high PARIS thrombotic score.

A numerical imbalance in baseline smoking status was noted between the two study groups, however, subgroup analyses showed no significant heterogeneity in treatment effects when comparing people who smoke versus those who do not. Furthermore, the findings remained consistent across both covariate adjusted analyses (smoking status was deemed clinically important and included as a prespecified covariate) and the crude analyses. Therefore, we believe that the numerically greater proportion of smokers in the standard DAPT group was due to chance and had no impact on the robustness of our results.

This endpoint included all cause death, stroke, myocardial infarction, BARC type 3 bleeding, revascularisation, and BARC type 2 bleeding. It is important to note that the clinical importance of all cause death and BARC type 2 bleeding is not equal.

Thirdly, the current study only investigated the impact of a less intensive antiplatelet regimen for acute coronary syndrome patients who received DCB based on indications endorsed by international consensus and the results should not be inferred as supporting the unrestricted use of DCB in all acute coronary syndrome patients. 13 28 Furthermore, only 44% of the participants were diagnosed with STEMI or non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, necessitating caution when generalising the results to these patients.

PMC11968333,PMC11968333_chunk_1,"Introduction
Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) occurring synchronously is a relatively rare presentation. A recent study from 2022 conducted with data from a hospital registry in Singapore found that between 2014 and 2018, the incidence of a concurrent cardiocerebral infarction (CCI) was 0.29% [ 1 ]. Another study published in 2021 with data from a hospital registry in the Philippines found that the prevalence of a synchronous CCI was 0.25% [ 2 ]. There is no literature reporting the prevalence of CCI in the United States.
CCI can be categorized into two subtypes, depending on the timing of the occurrence. Synchronous CCI occurs when the patient presents with simultaneous AMI and AIS, whereas metachronous CCI occurs when one event precedes the other within 72 hours, regardless of the order of presentation of AMI and AIS [ 3 ]. In the Philippines, synchronous CCI has a prevalence rate of 0.9%, whereas metachronous CCI has a prevalence rate of 0.9% to 12.7"

Some of the suggested etiologies of CCI include embolic and hypotensive causes [ 1 ]. Some of the mechanisms cited as embolic causes include a hypokinetic myocardial segment, thrombosis in the presence of a right-to-left shunt, atrial fibrillation, and a ventricular thrombus, while mechanisms under hypotensive causes include atherosclerotic stenosis, aortic dissection, myocardial infarction, and insular infarct with arrhythmia [ 1 ]. The insular cortex is a brain region involved in regulating sympathetic and parasympathetic signaling, and studies show that arrhythmias are more frequent when cerebral ischemia involves the insular cortex than when the insular cortex is not involved [ 4 ].

While the management of either AIS or AMI is well established, there are no clear guidelines for the management of a patient presenting with synchronous AIS and AMI. In addition, aspirin and clopidogrel, used in the management of AMI, can lead to hemorrhagic conversion of an AIS, complicating management further [ 5 ]. Further complicating the management of patients presenting with CCI is the complications that can develop when treating each condition separately. For example, if treatment to salvage the myocardium is initiated first, the delayed management of the ischemic stroke will result in worsening disability, whereas if treatment to salvage the brain tissue is initiated first, the delayed management of the myocardial infarction can result in hypotension or arrhythmias [ 6 ].

Symptoms began one hour prior to arrival. Further history could not be obtained due to the patient's aphasia. The patient's wife provided additional history, stating the patient's brother had a triple bypass at the age of 55, the patient's father died at the age of 52 from a myocardial infarction, and the patient's mother also suffered a myocardial infarction.

Since both AIS and AMI are time-sensitive conditions, delayed interventions may result in permanent disability or even death. Some of the dilemmas encountered in patients who present with CCI include: 1) different dosages of fibrinolytic therapy needed to treat AIS and AMI [ 7 ], 2) use of PCI requires heparin and dual-antiplatelet therapy, both which increase the risk of hemorrhagic conversion in AIS [ 8 ], and 3) risk of myocardial rupture when using thrombolytics in a patient with an acute STEMI [ 9 ]. A review of 25 cases of patients presenting with CCI showed that seven (28%) used mechanical thrombectomy, 15 (60%) underwent PCI, and nine (36%) received alteplase, showing that the management for CCI is individualized [ 7 ].

A similar algorithm has been proposed in a different study, favoring fibrinolysis as an initial treatment strategy in hemodynamically stable patients, followed by endovascular procedures [ 11 ].
The delay in detection of AMI in the patient in this case report was due to the global aphasia associated with his AIS, further complicating the management. One study on patients with CCI found that 83% of patients presented with focal neurological deficits, while 17% presented with AMI symptoms, including dyspnea and chest pain [ 2 ].

Conclusions
Cardiocerebral infarction (CCI) is a relatively rare but deadly condition that necessitates the establishment of clear management guidelines due to its high mortality and challenges in treatment strategies, including the risk of hemorrhagic conversion. This case report highlights the challenges in identifying and managing a patient presenting with CCI. When encountering a patient with a CCI, it is important to determine the hemodynamic stability of the patient, the time since onset of symptoms, and possible etiologies causing the presentation to optimize the management of the patient.

This case report contributes to the limited existing literature of patients presenting with CCIs, highlighting a case where a patient presenting with CCI was successfully managed while underscoring the need for guidelines managing of patients with CCIs. Further research needs to be conducted to determine optimal fibrinolytic dosage, determining whether to salvage the brain tissue or myocardium first, and subsequent anticoagulation strategies."
PMC12022475,PMC12022475_chunk_1,"Introduction
Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is characterized by the unexpected formation of intramural haemorrhage within the wall of an epicardial coronary artery with or without an intimal tear, resulting in an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). 1 Approximately 90% of SCAD cases occur in women, and SCAD is a frequent cause of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in young women. 1 A recent study hypothesized that the primary mechanism of SCAD is a disruption of the vasa vasorum resulting in the secondary intramural haemorrhage to form a haematoma, which may obstruct the bloodstream. 2 Haemophilia A and B are inherited X-linked recessive bleeding disorders caused by the absence or dysfunction of clotting factors VIII (FVIII) or IX. Some cohort studies revealed that patients with haemophilia are more likely to develop coronary artery disease, especially AMI, at a younger age despite the presence of bleeding disorders. 3 , 4 However, the mechanisms by which patients with haemophi"

Here, we report the first case of a patient with haemophilia who suffered AMI due to SCAD. We paid special attention to antithrombotic therapy during catheterisation. Further, we used high-resolution coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) to observe the SCAD lesion during the acute and healing phases, which seemed useful for SCAD lesion observation, especially in cases with a high risk of cardiac catheterisation.

Electrocardiography demonstrated no significant ST-segment elevation or depression ( Figure 1A ).

The ACT was reduced from 114 to 80 s and APTT was reduced from 58.7 to 31.1 s after 15 min of administration ( Table 1 ).

This imaging detected the presence of an intramural haematoma and the absence of an intimal tear ( Figure 2C, D, E ). No evidence indicated plaque rupture or erosion, which could have caused the ACS. Therefore, we diagnosed this patient with NSTEMI related to SCAD. Thrombolysis in myocardial infarction III flow was secured; thus, we adopted a conservative approach.

Discussion
We revealed two important clinical issues: (i) SCAD in a male patient with haemophilia and (ii) the usefulness of CCTA to observe SCAD lesions.
First, patients with haemophilia can develop MI due to SCAD. The cause of SCAD frequently includes pre-disposing factors associated with vascular vulnerabilities (e.g. fibromuscular dysplasia, connective tissue disorder or inherited tissue disorder) and precipitating factors such as emotional stress, physical stress (e.g. from an extreme Valsalva manoeuvre, retching, vomiting, coughing or isometric exercise), the use of stimulant medications or illicit drugs and hormonal triggers (e.g. pregnancy). 6 However, 90% of SCAD cases occur in wom"

The proportion of fibromuscular dysplasia is generally lower and physical exertion may trigger SCAD in male patients. 7 In this case, IVUS findings revealed an intramural haematoma without an intimal tear despite the absence of obvious pre-disposing or precipitating factors except for hypertension, which is predominantly observed in patients with haemophilia. Further, the lesion was flanked by arteries of normal calibre, resulting in a type 2A SCAD diagnosis. 1 Considering the hypothesis that the primary mechanism of SCAD is a vasa vasorum disruption resulting in secondary intramural haemorrhage forming a haematoma, in patients with haemophilia, the pre-disposition to bleeding may contribute to the expansion of the haem"

Previous cohorts reporting that patients with haemophilia developed MI at a young age did not include coronary imaging data, and these reports were conducted when SCAD was not well recognized. Therefore, young patients with haemophilia who developed MI may include SCAD cases. The present case does not provide a causal association between SCAD and haemophilia, but reports indicated spontaneous dissections in cervical vessels in a patient with haemophilia. 8 Additional research is required to confirm any potential connection between SCAD and haemophilia, but this report is important to recognize that young patients with haemophilia may be at risk of MI due to SCAD.

Second, CCTA may be a useful means of observing dissection lesions in patients with haemophilia having SCAD. In patients with haemophilia undergoing catheterisation, pre- and post-procedural coagulation factor supplementation is required, and careful attention must be paid to haemorrhagic complications such as haematoma formation at the puncture site. In our case, ultra-high-resolution CCTA confirmed both the flap in the acute phase and its resolution in the chronic phase. Catheterisation is undoubtedly the gold standard for diagnosing SCAD, but CT may be effectively used for follow-up.
Conclusions
We reported the first case of a patient with haemophilia who developed AMI due to SCAD, indicating an interaction in the pathogenesis. A high-resolution CCTA was useful to follow-up on the SCAD lesion.

We conducted a longitudinal cohort study using data from the California Teachers Study (CTS) which recruited participants in 1995 and 1996 by mailing questionnaires to all active and recently retired female members of the California State Teachers Retirement System. Participants who returned a self-administered questionnaire ( n = 133 479, median age at enrolment 53 years, range 22–104 years) have been followed prospectively since then, with five subsequent self-administered questionnaires. Additional details regarding CTS have been previously described. 18 , 19

Standard protocols and approvals
Institutional Review Board approval was granted through Weill Cornell Medicine as well as the City of Hope National Medical Center to use CTS. Data and statistical code used may be made available to other investigators upon their request to the CTS. We followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines. 20

The study exposure was any self-reported history of endometriosis on the baseline questionnaire (1995–1999) or questionnaire four (2005–2008). These two questionnaires are the only ones that asked if a participant has ever had endometriosis. A recent analysis of four international cohor"

A recent analysis of four international cohorts found that self-report of endometriosis on survey questionnaires could be confirmed by reviewing a combination of surgical, clinical, and pathological records in 84% of cases. 21 We report the number of CTS participants who answered that they had endometriosis on the baseline questionnaire and on questionnaire four. We considered participants who reported endometriosis on questionnaire four but not on the baseline questionnaire as having endometriosis throughout the study period because most patients with endometriosis have the onset of symptoms in adolescence and it is considered a disease of the entire reproductive lifespan in females despite significant diagnostic delay in many cases. 22

Results
We included a total of 120 435 participants in our final study cohort ( Figure 1 ). Of these participants, 13 754 (11.4%) reported a history of endometriosis. Compared to participants without endometriosis, those with endometriosis were slightly younger (mean age 53.0 vs. 52.3) and much more likely to have a history of migraine (18.3% vs. 28.7%) and severe anaemia (12.5% vs. 17.4%). Participants with endometriosis were also more likely to report regular use of aspirin (10.5% vs. 12.6%), statin (23.4% vs. 26%), anti-hypertensives (12% vs. 13.7%), and oral contraception (65.5% vs. 74.2%) ( Table 1 ).

Among the 13 754 participants who reported having endometriosis, 10 874 (79%) indicated this diagnosis on the baseline questionnaire and an additional 2880 (20.9%) reported it on questionnaire four. Of the 12 898 participants that reported taking aspirin on the baseline questionnaire, 5546 (43.0%) completed questionnaire four with only 686 of participants reporting that they had stopped taking aspirin on questionnaire four.

The median follow-up time was 25 years [interquartile range (IQR), 21.4–25.2] in participants with endometriosis and 25 years (IQR, 21.5–25.1) in participants without endometriosis. The incidence rate of MACE was 0.74 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.71–0.77] per 100 person-years among participants with endometriosis vs. 0.73 (95% CI, 0.72–0.75) per 100 person-years among participants without endometriosis. After adjusting for demographics, confounding, and dropouts, endometriosis was associated with an increased risk of MACE (IP-weighted HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.04–1.15; Figure 2 ).

In our age-stratified analysis, we found that endometriosis was most strongly associated with an elevated risk of MACE among participants under 40 years old (IP-weighted HR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.08–2.02). The incidence rate of MACE was 0.14 (95% CI, 0.11–0.19) per 100 person-years for participants with endometriosis, compared to 0.08 (95% CI, 0.07–0.09) per 100 person-years for those without it in this age group ( Table 2 ).

Out of 59 480 participants who completed both the baseline and fourth questionnaires and had no MACE before questionnaire four, 13 127 (22.8%) reported daily statin use. The median follow-up time was 15 years (IQR, 14.3–15.1). Among participants taking statin, the incidence rate of MACE was 1.52 (95% CI, 1.37–1.67) per 100 person-years for participants with endometriosis, compared to 1.55 (95% CI, 1.49–1.62) per 100 person-years for those without (IP-weighted HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.98–1.23).

In the endometriosis subgroup, aspirin use at baseline was associated with increased risk of MACE (IP-weighted HR 1.25; 95% CI, 1.11–1.41). In the non-endometriosis subgroup, aspirin use at baseline was also associated with increased risk of MACE (IP-weighted HR 1.24; 95% CI, 1.18–1.30).
In our study of 120 435 female teachers and administrators in the CTS, those with endometriosis had a higher risk of MACE, especially at younger ages, than those without endometriosis. We found that aspirin did not modify the effect of endometriosis on cardiovascular disease risk. To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to assess aspirin as a potential modifier of MACE risk in patients with endometriosis.

Multiple prior studies have shown that the risk of various adverse cardiovascular events is elevated in patients with endometriosis. 4–6 , 8–10 , 16 , 45 The HR point estimate for MACE in patients with endometriosis in our study was similar to the estimated hazard for cardiovascular disease in three studies, 5 , 8 , 9 , 45 lower than the estimated hazard for coronary heart disease in two studies, 6 , 16 and lower than the estimated hazard for stroke in one study (see Supplementary material online , Table S2 ). 10
Our finding that an increased MACE risk associated with endometriosis was highest before age 40 is also consistent with extant data, though the absolute risk is low.

A variety of mechanistic pathways have been postulated to explain the association between endometriosis and cardiovascular disease. To begin with, patients with endometriosis have cytokine and pro-angiogenic factor release leading to systemic inflammation. 49–52 This systemic inflammation can result in endothelial dysfunction which predisposes to arterial atherosclerotic changes in patients with endometriosis. 53–57 Endometriosis-related pain and stress 58 are also plausibly related to cardiovascular disease via increased inflammation and sympathetic activity. 59 , 60 Additionally, since genetic variants associated with endometriosis 61 , 62 overlap with some genetic variants associated with atherosclerosis resulting in cardiovascular disease, 11 , 63 the observed association between endometriosis and cardiovascular disease may be partially attributed to shared vascular risk factors causing both conditions.

We found that neither aspirin nor statin use is a modifier of the effect of endometriosis on MACE in this cohort. In fact, we found that baseline aspirin use was associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease across the cohort regardless of endometriosis.

We included a total of 120 435 participants in our final study cohort ( Figure 1 ). Of these participants, 13 754 (11.4%) reported a history of endometriosis. Compared to participants without endometriosis, those with endometriosis were slightly younger (mean age 53.0 vs. 52.3) and much more likely to have a history of migraine (18.3% vs. 28.7%) and severe anaemia (12.5% vs. 17.4%).

Among the 13 754 participants who reported having endometriosis, 10 874 (79%) indicated this diagnosis on the baseline questionnaire and an additional 2880 (20.9%) reported it on questionnaire four. Of the 12 898 participants that reported taking aspirin on the baseline questionnaire, 5546 (43.0%) completed questionnaire four with only 686 of participants reporting that they had stopped taking aspirin on questionnaire four.

The quality and effectiveness of pharmaceutical formulations depend on precise and reliable analytical techniques. Ensuring drug safety and regulatory compliance requires robust methods for accurately quantifying active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and detecting impurities that could compromise drug stability and patient health. Simultaneously quantifying multiple APIs remains a significant challenge, particularly in drug combinations like atorvastatin (ATO) (Fig. 1 a) and aspirin (ASP) (Fig. 1 b), which are widely used for cardiovascular disease prevention 1 , 2 .

Traditional methods such as high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), spectrofluorimetry, spectroscopy, and capillary electrophoresis are commonly employed for impurity quantification. Integrating impurity profiling into analytical method development strengthens drug quality assessment and ensures adherence to regulatory standards. Recent advancements underscore the need for more sensitive and selective techniques to enhance drug purity and efficacy 3 – 7 .
This study aims to develop an accurate and efficient first-derivative synchronous fluorescence spectrofluorimetric (FDSFS) method for simultaneously determining ATO and ASP in bulk powders and pharmaceutical formulations.

These features make SFS highly effective for analyzing multi-component mixtures without requiring pre-separation steps. Combining SFS with derivative techniques further improves sensitivity and selectivity by reducing spectral overlap, a common limitation of traditional fluorescence methods. These advantages make it a promising approach for monitoring drug quality through trustworthy analytical techniques to ensure patient safety 9 – 13 . SFS and its derivatives have recently been utilized for identifying drug combinations in biological fluids and dosage forms 14 – 22 .

Conventional and synchronous spectrofluorimetric methods have yet to be utilized for analyzing the binary mixture of ASP and ATO in biological fluids or pharmaceutical dosage forms due to significant fluorescence spectral overlap. This limitation makes conventional fluorometric methods unsuitable for precise estimation. However, FDSFS effectively overcomes this obstacle by utilizing derivative amplitude measurements, which provide additional advantages in selectivity and sensitivity.
Fluorometric techniques offer significant advantages over simpler and cost-effective methods, such as spectrophotometry and electrochemical analysis.

Additionally, they achieve lower detection limits and higher specificity in complex pharmaceutical matrices, making them invaluable for routine quality control 27 – 33 .
As sustainability becomes a growing priority, analytical method development must align with the principles of Green Analytical Chemistry (GAC) to minimize environmental impact. GAC emphasizes reducing hazardous chemicals, limiting waste production, and optimizing energy efficiency throughout method development. The FDSFS method exemplifies this approach by significantly minimizing the use of hazardous solvents and reducing energy consumption, making it an environmentally friendly alternative to conventional techniques.

To ensure its sustainability, standardized greenness assessment tools, including the Analytical Greenness Metric (AGREE), the Complex Multi-Objective Green Analytical Procedure Index (Complex MOGAPI), and the National Environmental Methods Index (NEMI), have been applied. These tools evaluate solvent selection, waste reduction, and energy efficiency, providing a comprehensive assessment of the method’s green profile. By integrating GAC principles and utilizing well-established assessment tools, the FDSFS method achieves a balance between analytical efficiency and environmental responsibility, paving the way for more sustainable practices in pharmaceutical and chemical analysis 34 – 41 .

By effectively addressing excipient interactions, this method guarantees reliable, interference-free drug quantification under all conditions 42 .
For any analytical technique to be widely adopted, it must demonstrate feasibility in real-world pharmaceutical applications.

Synchronous fluorescence spectra were recorded by scanning both monochromators at a constant Δλ of 80 nm. The first derivative of each synchronous spectrum was obtained using a data interval of 15 points at 384 nm and 365 nm for ATO and ASP, respectively, and the corresponding peak amplitudes were measured.

The optimal Δλ value is critical for achieving peak sensitivity, resolution, and overall performance in the synchronous fluorescence scanning (SFS) method.

The results indicated that 80 nm was the optimal Δλ, producing two well-defined peaks with ideal spectral shapes. In contrast, lower Δλ values led to reduced fluorescence intensity, while excessively low values caused spectral distortion for both drugs.

To assess the impact of pH on the fluorescence intensity of ASP and ATO (Fig. 6 b), two buffer types were tested: 0.2 M acetate buffer (pH 4.5–5.6) and 0.2 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.0–7.0). The results revealed that ASP exhibited its highest fluorescence intensity and stability in mildly acidic conditions, with a peak at pH 5.0.

Findings and discussions
In ethanol, Aspirin (ASP) and Atorvastatin (ATO) exhibit native fluorescence at 405 nm and 364 nm, respectively, when excited at 285 nm and 300 nm (Fig. 2 ). These excitation wavelengths were selected based on their intrinsic fluorescence properties, ensuring optimal excitation of each analyte to generate a strong and distinguishable emission signal. However, due to significant spectral overlap (Fig. 2 ), conventional fluorescence techniques lack sufficient selectivity for simultaneous determination.

To address this limitation, synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy (SFS) was employed to enhance selectivity and facilitate the differentiation of both drugs. Figure 3 a shows the synchronous fluorescence spectra of ATO at varying ASP concentrations, while Fig. 3 b illustrates the SFS spectra of ASP in the presence of different ATO concentrations. Despite applying SFS, considerable spectral overlap persisted, posing a challenge for independent quantification.

The first derivative synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy (FDSFS) was applied to enhance selectivity and eliminate spectral interference (Fig. 4 a, b). Under optimized conditions (Fig. 5 ), ATO was accurately determined at 384 nm, while ASP was quantified at 365 nm. The selection of Δλ = 80 nm was systematically optimized to enhance spectral resolution and minimize peak overlap. This choice provided multiple analytical advantages, including suppression of background fluorescence, improved differentiation between ATO and ASP signals, and an enhanced signal-to-noise ratio, leading to superior fluorescence intensity and analytical precision. Furthermore, the FDSFS method eliminates the "

Robustness
The robustness of the proposed method was evaluated by making minor adjustments to the optimized conditions, including slight variations in pH (± 0.1) and phosphate buffer volume (± 0.1 mL) while maintaining all other parameters unchanged. Each factor was altered individually to assess its impact on method performance.
Notably, these small modifications did not significantly affect the fluorescence intensity, demonstrating the method’s reliability under slightly varied conditions. As shown in Table 1 , the percentage RSD remained below 2%, confirming the robustness of the proposed approach.

Outcomes after acute myocardial infarction (MI) can be improved by lifestyle changes; control of cardiovascular risk factors; and treatment with secondary preventive medications, such as aspirin, P2Y12-inhibitors, statins, beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), and/or angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs), all of which are recommended in international guidelines [ 1 – 3 ].
Suboptimal treatment after MI has been repeatedly observed, with too few patients initiated on recommended secondary preventive treatments and many patients showing insufficient adherence to medication [ 4 – 13 ]. Poor adherence to prescribed secondary preventive drugs has been found to adversely affect prognosis [ 6 , 9 – 12 ].
About 6–8% of patients who experience MI are diagnosed with myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) [ 14 , 15 ]. Although this disorder was first recognized in the early 1980’s [ 16 – 18 ], diagnostic criteria and treatment r"

Although this disorder was first recognized in the early 1980’s [ 16 – 18 ], diagnostic criteria and treatment recommendations for MINOCA have only recently been established [ 2 , 19 , 20 ]. An AHA scientific statement from 2019 suggests that secondary preventive therapies might be considered on an individual basis in patients with MINOCA [ 20 ]. The guidelines from European Society of cardiology from 2020 recommend that patients with MINOCA, of unknown cause, might be followed-up similarly to patients diagnosed with MI with obstructive coronary arteries (MI-CAD), and be treated according to secondary prevention guidelines for atherosclerotic disease (class IIb recommendation) [ 2 ]. Recommendation on duration of the treatment is however scarce. The percentage prescribed secondary preventive drugs has been shown to be lower in patients with MINOCA than in those with MI-CAD in clinical routine [ 21 ,"
PMC12101741,PMC12101741_chunk_3,"uration of the treatment is however scarce. The percentage prescribed secondary preventive drugs has been shown to be lower in patients with MINOCA than in those with MI-CAD in clinical routine [ 21 , 22 ]. However, knowledge is lacking regarding adherence to medical treatment in patients with MINOCA and whether the different medication adherence measures, including initiation, implementation, and persistence rates of secondary preventive drug treatment differ between patients with MINOCA and MI-CAD. We therefore aim to evaluate the adherence to guideline recommended medications in patients with MINOCA and MI-CAD.
Methods
The present study is a Swedish nationwide register-based cohort study, based on the 155,518 unique patients in the SWEDEHEART registry [ 23 ], who were hospitalised due to acute MI and discharged between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2017.

Patient with at least one coronary stenosis ≥50% at coronary angiography were labelled MI-CAD and patients without were labelled MINOCA. Patients were excluded if they did not undergo in-hospital diagnostic coronary angiography, if their result of the coronary angiography was unknown, died within 30 days after discharge, or were receiving automatically dispensed doses of medication before admission to hospital. Patients who previously underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) were included in the MI-CAD group independently on findings at the latest coronary angiography. The final study cohort consisted of 116,378 individuals, 9138 with MINOCA and 107,240 with MI-CAD ( Fig 1 ).

Data on medication at hospital admission and hospital discharge were retrieved from the SWEDEHEART registry. Data regarding filled prescriptions for medications 6 months before hospital admission, and 1 and 6 months and 1–3 and 5 years after hospital admission, were retrieved from the Prescribed Drug Register.
Data on prescriptions for the following pharmaceuticals were included: acetylsalicylic acid (ATC-code B01AC06); P2Y12-inhibitors (B01AC04, B01AC22 and B01AC24); statins (C10AA and C10BA); beta blockers (C07); ACEs/ARBs including fixed combinations with thiazides (C09); Vitamin K antagonists (B01AA03); and novel oral anticoagulants (B01AE07, B01AF01, B01AF02 and B01AF03).

The study was approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board in Stockholm (diary number: 2012/60–31/2) and by the Swedish Ethical Review Authority (diary number: 2020–04252).
All three constructs of adherence to medication, namely initiation, implementation and persistence, were evaluated [ 26 ]. In assessing adherence to medication only patients who received their first prescription for the above-mentioned drugs at hospital discharge were included, to minimize selection bias, as the prevalence of medications at admission differed significantly in the MINOCA and MI-CAD cohorts.

The time of follow-up was divided into six periods, 2–6 months, 6–12 months, 1–2 years, 2–3 years and 3–5 years ( Fig 2 ).
Initiation was defined as the percentage of patients who had a drug prescription from a physician and dispensed the drug at a pharmacy within 30 days after discharge. Only patients who initiated medication were included in further analyses of implementation, discontinuation and persistence of that drug class.
Drug implementation, defined as the extent to which a patient’s actual dosing regimen corresponded to the prescribed dosing regimen, was estimated by determining the medication possession ratio (MPR) [ 26 , 27 ]. Briefly, for each time-period, the number of days a drug was available was divided by the number "

Briefly, for each time-period, the number of days a drug was available was divided by the number of days in that time-period. Stockpiling was included. The proportion of days with drug available was categorized as <50%, 50–80% and 80–100%, with an MPR ≥ 80% defined as high implementation [ 6 , 9 , 11 , 12 , 26 , 28 , 29 ].
Persistence in the present study was defined as the length of time between initiation and discontinuation of medical treatment. Patients were regarded as taking a drug as long as the prescription was refilled within the estimated time of the previous prescription, including drugs carried over from previous prescriptions. A grace period of 45 days was allowed, in which patients were considered continuously exposed to a drug if they refilled a prescription within 45 days after the estimated completion of previous prescriptions ( Fig 2 ).

The 45-day grace period were used to establish a reasonable balance between the need for monitoring short-term implementation and long-term persistence [ 27 ].
Patients were allowed to switch between drugs within the same drug class and still be considered persistent. If a patient failed to fill a new prescription within a given time, the date of non-persistence was defined as the calculated end of supply from the most recent prescription, including any stockpiling. On the first day of each interval, the proportion of persistent patients was calculated by dividing the number of persistent patients by the number of patients remaining in the cohort.

Patients who discontinued treatment were labeled non-persistent. Those who restarted treatment after being considered non-persistent were followed as a separate restarter group. The group users was defined as the sum of persistent and restarting patients. This provided an opportunity to capture patients restarting treatment after non-persistence and to calculate the actual proportion of patients receiving treatment at a certain time. The proportion of persistent patients at different time points was calculated by dividing the number of persistent patients by the number of patients remaining in the cohort at the first day of each interval,

Patients with MINOCA were as expected less often prescribed and initiated on treatment with all assessed drug classes than patients with MI-CAD ( S1 Table ).
Implementation, defined as the extent to which a patient’s actual dosing regimen corresponded to the prescribed dosing regimen, was highest at the beginning of follow-up and declined slowly over time. However, the proportions of patients with high implementation to treatment with aspirin, ACEI/ARBs, and beta blockers during all time periods were high in both the MINOCA and MI-CAD groups.

Discussion
This nationwide registry-based study investigated and compared the initiation, implementation and persistence rates of secondary preventive medications in patients with MINOCA and MI-CAD. Patients with MINOCA were less frequently prescribed secondary preventive medications at discharge, showed a lower rate of filling their first prescriptions, and had lower implementation and persistence rates than patients with MI-CAD.
The proportion of patients with high implementation decreased slowly over time, although >90% of patients in both groups initiated on aspirin, beta blockers, and ACEI/ARBs maintained a MPR ≥ 80% during the entire follow-up period. The decreasing proportion of patients taking "

The decreasing proportion of patients taking these medications over time is in agreement with several previous studies in patients with MI [ 6 , 9 , 10 , 12 ]. A recent study of statin implementation among patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease showed that only 21.4% had high implementation during the first year, decreasing to 19.8% at 3 years [ 28 ]. The different results between our study and this study may be due in part to different compositions of study cohorts and methodological differences in assessing implementation. The present study only measured implementation in patients who were persistent or labeled as users both at the beginning and the end of a time period, to avoid mix up non-implementation and non-persistence, whereas previous studies did not. Furthermore, implementation in the present study was calcul"

Furthermore, implementation in the present study was calculated using shorter time intervals at the start of follow-up because change of medications, side effects, and subsequent discontinuation may be more frequent at the beginning of treatment.
The present study found that the persistence of aspirin and statins in patients with MINOCA was in agreement with the results of previous studies assessing the persistence in MI patients at 12–18 months [ 5 , 7 , 8 ]. The rates of persistence of all medications throughout the entire follow-up period were higher in the present MI-CAD cohort than in previous studies [ 5 , 7 , 8 ]. The latter results are in agreement with a previous Swedish study investigating the long-term use of low-dose aspirin for both primary- and secondary prevention, with approximately 15% of those patients discontinuing long-term asp"
PMC12101741,PMC12101741_chunk_36,"ement with a previous Swedish study investigating the long-term use of low-dose aspirin for both primary- and secondary prevention, with approximately 15% of those patients discontinuing long-term aspirin treatment after 3 years [ 30 ]. In contrast, the proportion of MINOCA patients in the present study who discontinued aspirin treatment was higher. However, the previous study found that patients who discontinued aspirin had a 37% higher rate of cardiovascular events after 3 years than those who were persistent [ 30 ]. The applicability of these findings to patients with MINOCA remains to be determined.
Several principal differences between patients with MINOCA and MI-CAD may affect the initiation, implementation, and persistence of secondary preventive medical treatment. First, the uncertainty of the diagnosis of MINOCA may affect both the attending physicians and patients’ willingness to prescribe medications and follow the prescription, respectively. The cause of MINOCA remains uncl"
PMC12101741,PMC12101741_chunk_37,"ainty of the diagnosis of MINOCA may affect both the attending physicians and patients’ willingness to prescribe medications and follow the prescription, respectively. The cause of MINOCA remains unclear in many patients [ 2 , 20 , 31 , 32 ]. Thus, patients with MINOCA are less likely to be prescribed secondary preventive medications, less often undergo structured follow-up, and less frequently achieve secondary preventive targets than patients with MI-CAD [ 33 , 34 ].
As recent guidelines recommend all patients with an initial working diagnosis of MINOCA follow a diagnostic algorithm, including a cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) exam, to determine the underlying diagnosis [ 2 , 20 ] the previously experienced uncertainty should decrease with time. Henceforth, a CMR exam with an ischemic late gadolinium enhancement pattern that strengthens the indication for secondary preventive medical treatment, as it carries a more serious prognosis than a non-ischemic pattern, may improve both the "
PMC12101741,PMC12101741_chunk_38,"ate gadolinium enhancement pattern that strengthens the indication for secondary preventive medical treatment, as it carries a more serious prognosis than a non-ischemic pattern, may improve both the prescription of secondary preventive medications and follow-up [ 35 – 38 ].
Second, the characteristics of patients with MINOCA differ from those with traditional MI. MINOCA patients tend to be younger, are more often women, and have fewer traditional risk factors for atherosclerotic heart disease [ 14 , 15 , 39 ]. Women with MI have been found to be less likely than men to receive evidence-based therapies and have lower referral rates for cardiac rehabilitation [ 5 , 13 , 40 , 41 ]. Our subgroup analysis on women showed that the implementation of aspirin and statins were significantly higher in patients with MI-CAD than in those with MINOCA, whereas there was no difference in implementation rates of ACE/ARBs and beta blockers. Furthermore, persistence rates remained significantly higher i"
PMC12101741,PMC12101741_chunk_39,"in patients with MI-CAD than in those with MINOCA, whereas there was no difference in implementation rates of ACE/ARBs and beta blockers. Furthermore, persistence rates remained significantly higher in women with MI-CAD than in women with MINOCA, indicating that factors other than gender are important. Gender, however, may have a larger impact on the implementation and persistence of statins as perceived muscle symptoms associated with statin use are more common in women than in men [ 42 , 43 ].
None of the MINOCA patients in the present study had undergone a coronary intervention. MI patients treated without PCI are less frequently prescribed secondary preventive drugs than patients who undergo PCI (7). Prior cardiovascular treatment has also been associated with high long-term implementation of secondary preventive treatment [ 44 ]. In contrast, patients with asymptomatic disease may be less adherent [ 13 , 45 ].
Psychosocial factors may differ in patients with MINOCA and MI-CAD. Pre"

Psychosocial factors may differ in patients with MINOCA and MI-CAD. Previous Swedish studies have indicated that pre-existing psychiatric disorders are more common in patients with MINOCA [ 46 , 47 ]. Moreover, patients with MINOCA were found to have lower rates in the dimensions of vitality and mental health at 3 months follow-up than patients with MI-CAD [ 46 , 47 ]. Other psychosocial factors, such as perceived social support and sense of coherence, have been associated with long-term adherence to secondary preventive measures in patients with MI [ 48 ]. Psychological belief and attitude are important in unintentional non-adherence, and beliefs about medication are important in intentional non-adherence [ 49 ].

A recent consensus document discussing adherence to secondary preventive therapy after cardiovascular diseases, recommended focus on all the five dimensions of adherence to therapy simultaneously; including the patient, the disease, the therapy, the healthcare provider and the healthcare system [ 13 ]. Thus, improving medical adherence requires both time and commitment. Novel interventions like digital health tools and follow-up programs that are both structured and individualized may contribute to an improvement of future secondary preventive medical treatment after both MINOCA and MI-CAD, but should preferably be studied in randomized trials.

The use of registry reduces potential selection bias associated with studies of patients at selected hospitals or enrolled in health care insurance systems. Furthermore, restricting the assessment of implementation and persistence only to patients who had a de novo prescription for each indicated class of drugs reduced the influence of on-going prescriptions on long-term persistence.
However, this registry-based analysis had several limitations. The analysis relied on ICD-codes and the possibility of coding errors cannot be ruled out.

Supporting information
On the first day of each interval, the proportion of persistent patients was calculated by dividing the number of persistent patients by the number of patients remaining in the cohort. Only patients with a de novo prescription of a drug class were included in analysis of that drug class. Patients with ongoing treatment or a prescription 6 months prior to myocardial infarction were excluded from analysis of that drug class.

The mean overall DPI treatment duration in the HF cohort was 437.1 ± 177.9 (median 443; IQR, 371-550) days. In the no HF cohort the DPI duration was similar with a mean of 450.0 ± 202.37 (median 470; IQR, 365-583) days. There was no important difference in the proportion of patients of patients who permanently discontinued DPI therapy (HF, 19.6%; no HF, 21.9%). Of the remaining, the proportion of patients without interruption to their DPI therapy was similar in the HF and no HF cohorts (92.2% vs 92.3%).
During the study period, 4.9% (n = 43) of the HF cohort experienced a major adverse coronary event compared with 2.4% (n = 77) in those without HF, with an adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of 1.57 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-2.41; Table 2 ; Fig. 1 ).

The mean overall DPI treatment duration in the HF cohort was 437.1 ± 177.9 (median 443; IQR, 371-550) days. In the no HF cohort the DPI duration was similar with a mean of 450.0 ± 202.37 (median 470; IQR, 365-583) days. There was no important difference in the proportion of patients of patients who permanently discontinued DPI therapy (HF, 19.6%; no HF, 21.9%). Of the remaining, the proportion of patients without interruption to their DPI therapy was similar in the HF and no HF cohorts (92.2% vs 92.3%).
Clinical events
During the study period, 4.9% (n = 43) of the HF cohort experienced a major adverse coronary event compared with 2.4% (n = 77) in those without HF, with an adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of 1.57 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-2.41; Table 2 ;"

Discussion
Patients with ASCVD and concomitant HF who are treated with DPI therapy show twice the rate of MACE, driven by an increase in MI and CV death, compared with those without HF. Treatment with DPI therapy was not associated with an increased risk of major bleeding between patients with and without HF.
Historical trials that examined the use of vitamin K antagonists in patients with HF without evidence of atrial fibrillation, showed a lack of clinical benefit and increased risk of bleeding. 15 In the COMPASS trial, participants with chronic coronary artery disease or peripheral artery disease were randomized to rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily with 100 mg of aspirin, rivaroxaban 5 mg twice daily, or aspirin 100 mg alone.

In the trial, 5902 patients had a history of HF, of whom 12 had an EF of ≤ 40% with EF ≤ 30% as an exclusion criterion. This substudy showed that although patients with and without HF showed a similar relative risk reduction for MACE, there was a considerably larger absolute risk reduction of 2.4% in the HF cohort and 1.0% in the no HF cohort. 11 They also showed no significant difference in major bleeding among patients with or without HF (3.3% vs 1.9%).
The treatment arm of the COMPASS trial is the only relevant comparator to the presented registry study, which includes a similar population of patients with stable ASCVD ( Table 4 ). Among patients with HF in the XATOA registry, we observed a similar rate of MACE compared with patients with HF in the COMPASS trial (5.0% over 15 months vs 5.5% over 23 months) and a lower risk of major bleeding (0.9% vs 2.5%; "

This is despite that the XATOA registry included more symptomatic HF patients, a greater proportion of patients with an EF ≤ 40%, and those with more comorbidities. The results of the present XATOA registry analysis and subgroup analysis of the COMPASS trial show that patients with an EF ≤ 40% who are receiving DPI therapy have a higher rate of MACE compared with those with an EF > 40% (COMPASS: EF ≤ 40% = 10.2%; EF > 40% = 4.8%; XATOA: EF ≤ 40% = 8.8%, EF > 40% = 3.5%).

However, the XATOA registry included more symptomatic patients with HF and a higher burden of comorbidities compared with those in the COMPASS trial, suggestive against the presence of a significant selection bias. However, it is important to highlight that those in the COMPASS trial and XATOA registry are patients with ASCVD who initiate DPI therapy. This population varies significantly from traditional HF cohorts, which exclude patients with an alternative indication for anticoagulation such as atrial fibrillation and have more stable HF. This makes it challenging to contrast our cohort with other HF cohorts and partially explains why a paucity of HF events were observed. Compared with clinical trials, observational cohorts such as XATOA are at risk of lower ascertainment of bleeding events.

PMC12105749,PMC12105749_chunk_49," of lower ascertainment of bleeding events. Although this might lead to an underestimation of bleeding results in the overall cohort, it is less likely to detract from an analysis comparing subgroups in the cohort. Additionally, pragmatic cohorts without event and/or clinical adjudication are susceptible to higher rates of missing data (such as EF). Despite a nearly equal distribution of ASCVD in men and women, women are under-represented in the XATOA registry (21.8%), highlighting the continued need for focused efforts to improve diversity in CV research. 16 Our results should be interpreted in the context of these limitations.
Overall, we showed that in a generalizable population of patients with coronary artery disease or peripheral artery disease and concomitant HF, the rates of adverse clinical events and bleeding are similar to those in recent clinical trials.

Although patients with an EF of ≤ 40% who are receiving DPI therapy have higher rates of CV events with DPI therapy compared with those with an EF > 40%, previous studies have suggested they might also receive a greater benefit from the use of DPI therapy. On the basis of the cumulative experience from the current study and previous trials, DPI therapy should be strongly considered in patients with ASCVD and concomitant HF.

PMC12121825,PMC12121825_chunk_1,"Introduction
Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide [ 1 ]. International guidelines recommend secondary preventive treatment, including control of cardiovascular risk factors; lifestyle changes; and secondary preventive medications to improve outcome after acute myocardial infarction (MI) [ 2 , 3 ].
Poor medication adherence to secondary preventive therapy with aspirin, P2Y12-inhibitors, statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs)/angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) and beta blockers have repeatedly been demonstrated [ 4 – 7 ] and shown to unfavourably affect the prognosis [ 4 , 5 , 8 ]. According to a large meta-analysis, approximately 9% of all cardiovascular events in Europe may have been caused by poor medication adherence [ 4 ].
Myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) affect approximately 6–8% of all patients with MI [ 9 , 10 ]. Specific secondary preventive strategies for MINOCA were propos"
PMC12121825,PMC12121825_chunk_2,"4 ].
Myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) affect approximately 6–8% of all patients with MI [ 9 , 10 ]. Specific secondary preventive strategies for MINOCA were proposed recently by both the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) [ 11 ] and the American Heart Association (AHA) [ 12 ]. In the guidelines from ESC, patients with MINOCA of unknown cause may be treated according to secondary prevention guidelines for atherosclerotic disease (class IIb recommendation) and followed-up in the same way as patients diagnosed with MI with obstructive coronary arteries (MI-CAD). Hence, antiplatelet agents should be used to reduce risk for thrombotic events, statins to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (LDL-C) to a sufficient level and blood-pressure agents to target age appropriate blood-pressure levels [ 3 , 11 ].

The scientific statement from AHA also recommends that all modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease should be treated aggressively in MINOCA patients with any evidence of atherosclerosis [ 12 ]. Furthermore, previous observational studies indicate long-term beneficial effects of treatment with secondary preventive medications, achieving target range LDL-C and participation in exercise training programs [ 13 – 16 ].
The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between persistence to secondary preventive medications and long-term prognosis in patients with MINOCA and MI-CAD.

This large nationwide registry-based study demonstrated for the first time a strong association between the persistence to secondary preventive medication and prognosis in patients with MINOCA. The risk reducing effect is in the same magnitude for patients with MINOCA as for patients with MI-CAD, further strengthening the indications for secondary preventive medical treatment in MINOCA.
International guidelines from both the ESC [ 3 ] and AHA [ 2 ] have advocated the importance of secondary preventive medical treatment after MI, including aspirin, beta blockers, ACEI/ARI and statins. Since these guidelines mainly apply to patients with MI-CAD, the secondary preventive medical treatment of patients with MINOCA has been more arbitrary and dependent on individual physicians’ considerations. However, since 2019 there are recommendations from both ESC and AHA proposing MINOCA specific secondary preventive treatments with focus on reducing risk factors for cardiovascular disease [ 11 , "

In the present study persistent use of the secondary preventive medications aspirin, ACEI/ARB, beta blockers and statins, were associated with a decrease in the risk of the composite endpoint (MACE) in both MINOCA and MI-CAD patients. The results for MI-CAD is in concordance with several previous observational studies [ 4 , 5 , 8 ].
A strong covariation in persistence to one or more secondary preventive medications was demonstrated in the present study. To distinguish the prognostic effect of one individual group of drugs among the use of several others may therefore be challenging. Furthermore, patients who are persistent to secondary preventive drugs are also adherent to other secondary preventive interventions as well. In this study, patient with long-term persistence to statins t"

In this study, patient with long-term persistence to statins tended to cease smoking, participate in physical activities and reach desired LDL-C goals at 12 months to a larger degree. This is in agreement with previous studies showing that patients initiating and adhering to secondary preventive treatments for lowering LDL-C and blood-pressure are more likely to engage in other health-promoting behaviors [ 23 – 25 ]. It is therefore always important to acknowledge the “healthy adherer” effect in studies evaluating the effects of therapies on health outcomes [ 26 ].
The differences between studies in the method used to measure persistence may make comparing results more complex [ 27 ]. The present study applied a strict initial definition, measuring persistence only in patients with primary adherence to treatment, and a less rigid follow-up approach i"

The present study applied a strict initial definition, measuring persistence only in patients with primary adherence to treatment, and a less rigid follow-up approach including patients who restarted treatment in the user group. Both of these factors may have resulted in higher levels of persistence at later time points than observed with other approaches, but may better reflect real world conditions.
However, the results are in agreement with a previous review of five adjusted observational studies, which indicated survival benefits of statins, beta blockers and dual antiplatelet therapy and reduced risk for MACE of ACEI/ARB among patients with MINOCA [ 13 ]. Similar positive effects were found in a small observational study suggesting longer survival in MINOCA patients treated with statin and ACEI/ARB [ 16 ] and in large observational study indicating long-term beneficial effects of treatment with statins and ACEI/ARB on MACE in patients with MINOCA an"

In this nationwide registry-based study, almost all patients hospitalized in Sweden for acute MI in 2006–2017 were included allowing analyses of large and unselected patient cohorts. The results reflect real-life practice as contrary to the setting of randomized controlled trials, thereby enhancing the generalizability. A nationwide registry with consecutive enrollment reduced the selection bias associated with studies of patients at selected hospitals or subscribed in a particular health care insurance system. In addition, restricting the assessment of persistence to patients who had a de novo prescription for a drug class of interest reduce the risk for prevalent user bias.

Strengths and limitations
In this nationwide registry-based study, almost all patients hospitalized in Sweden for acute MI in 2006–2017 were included allowing analyses of large and unselected patient cohorts. The results reflect real-life practice as contrary to the setting of randomized controlled trials, thereby enhancing the generalizability. A nationwide registry with consecutive enrollment reduced the selection bias associated with studies of patients at selected hospitals or subscribed in a particular health care insurance system.

Conclusions
Persistence to secondary preventive medications after MI is associated with a reduction in the risk for MACE in both patients with MINOCA and MI-CAD. Continuous efforts to improve adherence to evidence-based medications in general to all patients with MI should be a priority.

STOPDAPT-3 ( NCT04609111 ) was a physician-initiated, prospective, multicenter, open-label, adjudicator blinded randomized clinical trial where we compared the bleeding and cardiovascular outcomes between an experimental group of 1-month prasugrel monotherapy without aspirin and a control group of 1-month DAPT with aspirin and prasugrel in patients planned for PCI using cobalt-chromium everolimus-eluting stent (CoCr-EES: Xience TM series, ABBOTT Vascular) implantation. The detailed study protocol and main results are reported elsewhere. 11 The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the Ethical Guidelines for Medical and Health Research Involving Human Subjects in Japan. In brief, a total of 6,002 patients with acute coronary syndrome regardless of Academic Research Consortium high bleeding risk (ARC-HBR) or non-acute coronary syndrome with high bleeding risk were enrolled between January 2021 to April 2023 from 72 centers in Japan, and were rando"

After randomization, a loading dose of prasugrel 20 mg was administered in both groups. A loading dose of aspirin 162–200 mg was also administered in aspirin-naïve patients in the DAPT group. Prasugrel 3.75 mg/day in the no-aspirin group, and aspirin 81–100 mg/day and prasugrel 3.75 mg/day in the DAPT group were continued up to 1 month after PCI.

Baseline Characteristics
There were 401 patients in the no-aspirin group and 413 patients in the DAPT group ( Figure 1 ). In the total study population, the mean age was 71.0 years, 78.6% of the patients were men, and 83.7% of the patients presented as acute coronary syndrome ( Table 1 ). The mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 58.3 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , and the prevalence of moderate (eGFR 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) and severe (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 or hemodialysis) chronic kidney disease was 40.5% and 10.0%, respectively.

Multivessel PCI targets were presented in 92.6% of patients with a mean number of target lesions of 2.4, and 10.0% of patients had a chronic total occlusion target. Intravascular imaging was used in 93.1% of patients. Baseline characteristics were well balanced between the no-aspirin and DAPT groups, except for the higher prescription rate of proton-pump inhibitors in the DAPT group compared with the no-aspirin group.

Categorical variables are presented as n (%). Continuous variables are presented as mean±SD, or median [interquartile range]. Moderate and severe chronic kidney disease are defined using the criteria in the ARC-HBR (moderate: estimated glomerular filtration rate 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ; severe: estimated glomerular filtration rate <30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 or hemodialysis). Values are missing for left ventricular ejection fraction in 40 patients, estimated glomerular filtration rate in 2 patients, and total stent length in 1 patient. Number of target lesions and total stent length are based on the first index PCI, as well as the staged PCI within 1 month.

Clinical Outcomes
The co-primary bleeding endpoint occurred in 15 (3.74%) patients in the no-aspirin group and 8 (1.94%) patients in the DAPT group at 1 month (HR 1.94; 95% CI 0.82–4.57; P=0.13) ( Figure 2A ). The co-primary bleeding endpoint after the first staged PCI occurred in 5 (1.25%) patients in the no-aspirin group and 3 (0.73%) patients in the DAPT group (HR 1.71; 95% CI 0.41–7.18; Table 3 ). The details of the co-primary bleeding endpoint are shown in Table 4A . Among 15 patients who had a co-primary bleeding endpoint in the no-aspirin group, 4 patients (numbers 3, 7, 11, and 14 in Table 4A ) were considered to have a procedural complication (e.g., access-site bleeding, ischemic stroke with hemorrhagic conversion, or cardiac tamponade) due to the staged PCI.

Discussion
The main findings of the present STOPDAPT-3 subgroup analysis are as follows: (1) an aspirin-free prasugrel monotherapy relative to DAPT failed to reduce major bleeding within 1 month in patients undergoing staged PCI; and (2) an aspirin-free prasugrel monotherapy relative to DAPT had a numerically higher incidence of cardiovascular events within 1 month in patients undergoing staged PCI.

Therefore, data of the optimal duration of DAPT in patients requiring staged PCI were scarce.

The removal of aspirin might be ineffective in reducing procedure-related bleeding.
Several single-arm studies reported that an aspirin-free strategy immediately after PCI was not associated with any spontaneous myocardial infarction or stent thrombosis in selected low-risk patients. 8 – 10 However, because patients requiring staged PCI were not enrolled in these studies, the safety of an aspirin-free strategy for patients undergoing staged PCI has not been evaluated so far.

In the STOPDAPT-3 trial, patients undergoing staged PCI were recommended to take each assigned antiplatelet regimen without additional loading doses according to the study protocol, and more than 90% patients received the assigned antiplatelet regimen. The incidence of the co-primary cardiovascular endpoint was numerically higher in the no-aspirin group than in the DAPT group. In addition, the incidence of the co-primary cardiovascular endpoint, which occurred after the first staged PCI, was numerically higher in the no-aspirin group than in the DAPT group. Considering the similar risk of major bleeding between the no-aspirin and DAPT groups in patients undergoing staged PCI in the present study, DAPT should be continued up to at least 1 month after staged PCI.

PMC12223531,PMC12223531_chunk_1,"Introduction
Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of mortality worldwide [ 1 ], responsible for over 17.3 million deaths annually, a number projected to increase to 23.6 million by 2030 [ 2 ]. Coronary artery and peripheral vascular disease are the primary contributors to the global burden of CVD [ 3 ]. Projections from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 study estimated a 90 % increase in cardiovascular prevalence, a 73.4 % rise in crude mortality, and a 54.7 % growth in crude disability-adjusted life years between 2025 and 2050, with cardiovascular deaths anticipated to climb from 20.5 million in 2025 to 35.6 million by 2050 [ 4 ]. In Europe, CVD account for 39 % of all deaths in men and 46 % of all deaths in women [ 5 ], whereas in the United States, coronary heart disease causes one in seven deaths [ 6 ], with heart failure responsible for one in nine [ 6 ]. Despite reductions in overall CVD mortality in South Korea, ischemic heart disease remains a growing conce"

Despite reductions in overall CVD mortality in South Korea, ischemic heart disease remains a growing concern [ 7 ]. The primary driver of these diseases is arterial thrombosis resulting from atherosclerosis, often triggered by plaque rupture [ 8 ]. While platelets are critical for maintaining hemostasis under normal conditions, they can become hyperactivated, leading to thrombotic complications [ 9 , 10 ]. Such complications including ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction underscore the importance of targeting platelet activation and thrombus formation to prevent and manage CVD [ 11 , 12 ].
In recent years, natural compounds have been recognized as safer alternatives to traditional synthetic drugs for managing inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases [ [13] , [14] , [15] , [16] , [17] ]. Among these, ginseng, particularly Panax ginseng , has been particularly valued for its well-documented"
PMC12223531,PMC12223531_chunk_3,"rugs for managing inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases [ [13] , [14] , [15] , [16] , [17] ]. Among these, ginseng, particularly Panax ginseng , has been particularly valued for its well-documented health benefits [18] , [19] , [20] . Ginsenosides, the active saponins derived from ginseng, are known for their anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and cardioprotective properties [ 18 , 21 ]. Ginseng can improve endothelial function [ 22 ], reduce oxidative stress [ 23 ], and regulate lipid metabolism [ 24 ], all of which are beneficial for heart health. On the other hand, the utility of current synthetic antiplatelet therapies, such as aspirin and P2Y12 inhibitors, although effective, is often limited by adverse effects such as gastrointestinal bleeding, platelet resistance, and increased bleeding risks, especially with long-term use [ 25 ]. These adverse effects underscore the need for safer and more effective alternatives. Therefore, ginseng and its constituents, such as ginsenoside Rg5,"
PMC12223531,PMC12223531_chunk_4,"ding risks, especially with long-term use [ 25 ]. These adverse effects underscore the need for safer and more effective alternatives. Therefore, ginseng and its constituents, such as ginsenoside Rg5, may offer promise in terms of its ability to enhance cardioprotection while causing minimal adverse effects compared to its conventional synthetic counterpart treatments.
Rg5 is a minor ginsenoside, resulting from the deglycosylation of Rb1 and dehydration at carbon position 20 of Rg3 [ 26 ]. Unlike major ginsenosides, Rg5 exhibits enhanced pharmacological properties, including antitumor, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, neuroprotective, and cardioprotective activities [ 26 ]. Rg5 enhances vascular health by promoting neovascularization and vasorelaxation through insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) activation, which triggers angiogenic signaling, thereby improving endothelial function under pathological conditions [ 27 ]. Additionally, it protects cardiomyocytes from ischemic i"

Additionally, it protects cardiomyocytes from ischemic injury by modulating mitochondrial dynamics via hexokinase-II (HK-II) and dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), suppressing Drp1 activation and promoting HK-II binding through Akt activation [ 28 ]. Rg5 has been reported to inhibit arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation, highlighting its potential as an antiplatelet agent [ 29 ]. However, while previous studies have screened Rg5 for its antiplatelet activity, we provide the first mechanistic evidence of its specific antiplatelet effects (Graphical abstract). These findings support the hypothesis that Rg5 may offer a promising therapeutic option, providing enhanced cardioprotection while potentially reducing the adverse effects associated with conventional synthetic treatments.

Results
Fig. 1 A illustrates the molecular structure of ginsenoside Rg5. Light transmission aggregometry was performed by incubating hPRP with Rg5 at concentrations of 35, 50, 75, and 100 μM, in the presence of collagen (2.5 μg/mL) ( Fig. 1 B), thrombin (2.5 U/mL) ( Fig. 1 C), and U46619 (200 nM) ( Fig. 1 D). Rg5 significantly inhibited collagen-induced platelet aggregation at 35 μM and fully inhibited it at 100 μM. In contrast, Rg5 at 35 μM did not significantly affect thrombin (2.5 U/mL), and U46619 (200 nM) induced platelet aggregation but significantly inhibited aggreg"

In contrast, Rg5 at 35 μM did not significantly affect thrombin (2.5 U/mL), and U46619 (200 nM) induced platelet aggregation but significantly inhibited aggregation at concentrations between 50 and 100 μM. These results suggest that Rg5 strongly inhibits platelet aggregation through the collagen receptor (GPVI) pathway. The IC 50 of Rg5 was calculated to be 42.5 μM ( Fig. 1 E).

Further, Rg5 significantly and dose-dependently increased intracellular cAMP and cGMP levels at 35–100 μM. This indicates an enhancement of cyclic nucleotide-mediated platelet inhibition.

Discussion
Rg5 inhibited collagen, thrombin, and U46619-induced platelet aggregation, with the strongest effect on collagen-induced aggregation via the GPVI receptor ( Fig. 1 ). These results suggest that Rg5 preferentially targets GPVI-mediated signaling pathways, which are critical for platelet activation and thrombus formation [ 33 , 34 ]. Further, our data reveal that Rg5 significantly inhibits intracellular calcium mobilization ([Ca 2+ ]i), a key secondary messenger in platelet activation [ 35 , 36 ]. The observed reduction in calcium signaling by Rg5 affects InsP3R function and suppresses upstream signaling proteins, such as p-cPLA 2 and p-p38 ( Fig. 2 A and E). These molecules are critical regulators of calcium release from intracellular stores, and their inhibition by Rg5 suggests a direct interference with pathways essential for platelet activation as reported pr"

Furthermore, Rg5 reduced ATP and serotonin release, key markers of dense granule secretion, in a dose-dependent manner ( Fig. 2 B and C). This indicates suppression of platelet degranulation, an essential step for sustained platelet activation and recruitment. The reduction in CD62P (P-selectin) expression further confirms the inhibition of α-granule release ( Fig. 2 D). This plays a significant role in platelet-platelet and platelet-endothelium interactions during thrombus formation [ 40 ].
Rg5 significantly inhibited TXB 2 production, a stable metabolite of TXA 2 , an inducer of platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction [ 41 ]( Fig. 3 ). The downregulation of p-cPLA 2 , a key enzyme in TXA 2 synthesis, further supports the ability of Rg5 to i"

The downregulation of p-cPLA 2 , a key enzyme in TXA 2 synthesis, further supports the ability of Rg5 to inhibit TXA 2 signaling [ 42 ]. Rg5 also inhibited thrombin-induced clot retraction, an integrin αIIbβ3-mediated process that contributes to thrombus stabilization [ 43 ]( Fig. 4 ). This effect was accompanied by an increase in clot area, indicating that it disrupts the final common pathway of platelet aggregation, which involves these molecules bridging activated platelets [ 44 ].
Western blot analysis revealed that Rg5 downregulated key signaling proteins involved in platelet activation, including p-ERK, p-p38, p-Syk, and p-GSK-3α/β ( Fig. 5 A). These kinases are critical mediators of GPVI, thrombin, and TX receptor signaling [ 45 ]. Notably, the inhibition of p-Syk and p-ERK highlights the ability of Rg5 to interfere with the early stages of GPVI-mediated signaling cascades. Interestingl"

Notably, the inhibition of p-Syk and p-ERK highlights the ability of Rg5 to interfere with the early stages of GPVI-mediated signaling cascades. Interestingly, Rg5 upregulated the phosphorylation of VASP at Ser157 and Ser239, which are associated with increased cAMP and cGMP signaling, respectively. One possible explanation is that Rg5 may modulate VASP phosphorylation through alternative pathways, such as inhibition of phosphodiesterase enzymes or direct effects on PKA and (PKG ( Fig. 5 B). Rg5 inhibited collagen + oxLDL-induced CD162 (PSGL-1) expression ( Fig. 5 C). This is a critical finding because CD162 is involved in platelet-leukocyte interactions, playing an important role in inflammation and atherothrombosis [ 46 ]. OxLDL is known to enhance platelet activation through pathways involving CD162 and other adhesion molecules [ 46 , 47 ]. By inhibiting platelet-leukocyte aggregation, Rg5 not only attenuates platelet aggregation but also r"
PMC12223531,PMC12223531_chunk_53,"nce platelet activation through pathways involving CD162 and other adhesion molecules [ 46 , 47 ]. By inhibiting platelet-leukocyte aggregation, Rg5 not only attenuates platelet aggregation but also reduces the inflammatory component of thrombus formation.
I n vivo, FeCl 3 -induced thrombosis model in mice provided further evidence of its antithrombotic potential, with 20 mg/kg Rg5 significantly prolonging occlusion time and reducing thrombus formation more effectively than aspirin ( Fig. 6 ) [ 10 , 48 ].
Rg5 inhibits platelet activation and thrombus formation while demonstrating no cytotoxicity, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic agent for thrombotic cardiovascular diseases.

Furthermore, it is crucial to identify the specific molecular targets of Rg5 and its interactions with other signaling pathways for advancing the clinical development of this compound. In conclusion, this study provides novel mechanistic insights into the antiplatelet activity of Rg5, demonstrating its potential as a safer and more effective therapeutic agent to prevent thrombotic disorders.

Study Population and Covariates
We identified adults ≥18 years of age with AF who underwent PCI for myocardial infarction from January 1, 2016 to June 30, 2023. PCI was defined as the placement of ≥1 intracoronary drug‐eluting stent or bare‐metal stent. For each patient with AF who underwent PCI, we extracted information on his or her demographics, consisting of age, sex, and race. Relevant comorbidities, as shown in Table 1 , were also characterized. Hospital characteristics, year of encounter, encounter type, and insurance information were also collected.

A total of 29 226 patients were included (67.3% men), with 4777 (16.3%) receiving an immediate transition to double therapy and 24 449 (83.7%) receiving an initial course of triple therapy.

Immediate transition to double therapy was associated with similar in‐hospital mortality, major bleeding, ICH, and NACEs compared with those receiving an initial course of triple therapy post‐PCI, although we did observe a signal for a slightly higher incidence of stent thrombosis (absolute difference 0.3%) in those transitioning to a single antiplatelet agent on day 1 post‐PCI. This higher risk appeared to be driven by patients with STEMI.

All randomized trials comparing double and triple therapy to date have mandated a short course of triple therapy before transitioning to double therapy, with most requiring at least 30 days. 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 The AUGUSTUS (Antithrombotic Therapy After Acute Coronary Syndrome or PCI in Atrial Fibrillation) trial was the only exception, with an average triple therapy duration of 6.5±4.1 days. 5 Although the AUGUSTUS trial was not powered to assess for coronary ischemic events, it did report more of these events in the double therapy group, a trend seen in other trials as well. 5 Our study is the first to investigate outcomes in patient with AF started immediately on double therapy following PCI, finding that >15% receive this therapeutic approach in contemporary clinical practice, despite the lack of randomized trials testing this strategy.

Although statistically nonsignificant, nearly all the point estimates in our study favored an initial course of triple therapy, and more studies will be needed to examine whether such concern is valid. We observed a small but statistically significant increase in stent thrombosis among those receiving immediate double therapy, driven by a difference in patients with STEMI. This difference was preserved even after IPTW was performed, suggesting stronger evidence. A trend toward increased risk of stent thrombosis in patients receiving double therapy was observed in some, but not all, randomized trials on this topic. 5 , 6 , 7 However, meta‐analyses have found that the modest increase in ischemic risk is generally outweighed by the significant reduction in bleeding risk. 12 , 13 , 14 This suggests that the highest risk subgroup of patients, such as those presenting with STEMI, may benefit from an init"

The strengths of our study include a large sample size from >1000 US hospitals. However, its limitations include the observational design, which may introduce confounding and bias when attempting to draw conclusions around causal inference. Additionally, 31.5% of patients were excluded due to missing medication data, which could introduce selection bias. The complexity of intervened lesions, severity of comorbid conditions, and duration of triple therapy were not accounted for in our analysis because of lack of granular details.

In conclusion, many cardiologists are transitioning their patients with AF to double therapy immediately following PCI, despite the lack of randomized controlled evidence for this approach. Our study suggests that this is likely safe for select patients with AF following PCI. However, we observed a signal for increased risk of stent thrombosis with immediate double therapy in select populations, specifically those presenting with STEMI. This suggests that the highest risk subgroups of patients likely benefit from an initial course of triple therapy before transitioning to double therapy. Future randomized trials are needed to determine which patients require an initial short course of triple therapy before transitioning to double therapy in patients with AF post‐PCI and, if so, to establish the optimal duration.

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) is a common, costly, and potentially life-threatening disease [ 1 ]. It must be managed promptly and appropriately to prevent adverse outcomes [ 1 ]. Peptic ulcer bleeding is the most common type of UGIB, accounting for 31–67% of all cases, followed by erosive disease, variceal bleeding, esophagitis, malignancies, and Mallory-Weiss tear [ 1 , 2 ]. In the U.S., the annual rate of hospitalization for peptic ulcer disease and UGIB is estimated to be 165 per 100,000 in 1999—more than 300,000 hospitalizations per year, at a cost of $2.5 billion [ 3 , 4 ]. After antimicrobial drugs became available to eradicate H. pylori, the hospitalization rate for peptic ulcer disease decreased to 56.5/100,000 in 2005 (95% CI 54.6–58.3) [ 5 ]. Furthermore, despite advances in therapy, the mortality rate has remained unchanged at 7–10% [ 6 ]. This may be because today’s patients are older and have more comorbidities than did patients in the past [ 7 ].

UGIB can produce hypovolemia, hypotension, and diminished oxygen-carrying capacity, which causes myocardial ischemia and necrosis [ 8 – 11 ]. Prior studies of UGIB and AMI are small, and long-term effects of UGIB on AMI have not been delineated. In addition, all the previous studies focused on the simultaneous presentation of AMI and UGIB [ 8 – 11 ], and the subacute and long-term effects of UGIB on the subsequent risk of AMI in CAD patients were still unclear, even though the impact of UGIB is expected to be larger in CAD patients [ 9 , 10 ]. Therefore, we did a population-based, nested case-control study to investigate UGIB and the subsequent AMI risk in CAD patients.

The Taiwan National Health Insurance (NHI) Program, a universal health care system that covers 99% of the country’s population of 23.3 million [ 12 ], has one of the world’s largest and most complete population-based healthcare claims datasets. The NHI Research Database (NHIRD) contains encrypted patient identification numbers, ICD-9-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification) codes for applied clinical diagnoses and procedures, details of prescribed drugs, dates of admission and discharge, and basic sociodemographic information, including gender and date of birth. All the expenses of CAD, UGIB, and AMI are covered by NHI.

PMC4631331,PMC4631331_chunk_21,"GIB, especially women and those < 65 years old, had twice the risk of developing an AMI than did CAD patients without UGIB. To prevent AMI and subsequent mortality and morbidity, early referral of CAD patients with UGIB for additional evaluation and treatment may be needed.
Other studies have reported that the prevalence of AMI in patients with UGIB ranges from 1% to 14% [ 8 – 11 ]. There is no general agreement about risk stratification of AMI in patients with UGIB. Some studies [ 8 – 11 , 13 , 14 ] suggest that those with a greater number of coronary risk factors, a history of CAD, lower blood pressure on admission, older age, severe illnesses, or lower hemoglobulin have a greater risk of AMI.
There are two scenarios between UGIB and AMI. The first one is that UGIB predisposes a patient to develop AMI, and the second is that AMI predisposes a patient to develop UGIB. Cappell (2000) suggested that when UGIB precipitates an AMI, it tends to be acute and massive, whereas UGIB precipitat"
PMC4631331,PMC4631331_chunk_22,"to develop AMI, and the second is that AMI predisposes a patient to develop UGIB. Cappell (2000) suggested that when UGIB precipitates an AMI, it tends to be acute and massive, whereas UGIB precipitated after an AMI has been treated tends to be self-limited and often resolves with the reversal of underlying coagulopathy [ 15 ]. We found that UGIB has a continuing potential to induce a subsequent AMI in CAD patients. This may be because of (i) anemia and hypoperfusion: AMI secondary to ischemia may be due to a decrease in the body’s oxygen supply. Bellotto (2005) showed that hemoglobin ≤ 8.2 g/dL was a significant risk factor for myocardial necrosis [ 8 ]. Activating the sympathetic nervous system can increase demand for myocardial oxygen and worsen ischemia; or (ii) discontinuing of antiplatelet use: antiplatelet drug therapy, such as aspirin and clopidogrel, should be continued to reduce the risk of plaque rupture and recurrent AMI. In the present study, UGIB [+] AMI [+] patients used"
PMC4631331,PMC4631331_chunk_23,"atelet use: antiplatelet drug therapy, such as aspirin and clopidogrel, should be continued to reduce the risk of plaque rupture and recurrent AMI. In the present study, UGIB [+] AMI [+] patients used less aspirin than did UGIB [+] AMI [−] patients. Aspirin was always discontinued after UGIB because aspirin doubles the risk of bleeding ulcers, even at doses as low as 75 mg daily [ 16 ]. Aspirin is first-line, because of its low cost and comparable efficacy, and clopidogrel is reserved for patients who cannot tolerate aspirin [ 17 ]. The combination of clopidogrel and aspirin may reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, but it raises the risk of hemorrhage [ 17 ]. In total, 64.7% AMI [+] patients have antiplatelet therapy (aspirin, clopidogrel, or both), which was a relative low percentage. There was no report about the compliance of antiplatelet therapy in patients with CAD in Taiwan. However, a study about antihypertensive medication compliance in Taiwan reported only 53% of the pati"
PMC4631331,PMC4631331_chunk_24,". There was no report about the compliance of antiplatelet therapy in patients with CAD in Taiwan. However, a study about antihypertensive medication compliance in Taiwan reported only 53% of the patients had high compliance with antihypertensive medication [ 18 ], which may be due to the characteristics of this population. The present study also showed UGIB [+] AMI [+] patients took more proton pump inhibitors and more H 2 receptor blockers than did UGIB [+] AMI [−] patients, which suggested that both of these two drugs may not reduce the AMI risk in UGIB [+] patients.
In the subgroup analysis, we found that women and patients < 65 years old had twice the risk of developing an AMI than did CAD patients without UGIB, which has never been reported before. Other studies [ 8 – 11 , 13 , 14 ] reported that older age is a risk factor and simultaneous UGIB and AMI occurred most often in men.

PMC4631331,PMC4631331_chunk_25,"reported that older age is a risk factor and simultaneous UGIB and AMI occurred most often in men. Although our data do not give us sufficient information to explain this apparent discrepancy, we hypothesize that women and patients < 65 have fewer comorbidities than do men and the elderly; therefore, UGIB is the most likely factor that contributes to AMI.
This study has some limitations. First, the comorbidities relied on the claims data and ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes, which may have resulted in disease misclassification. However, many studies have validated that ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes of NHIRD have a high sensitivity and specificity for the actual diagnosis [ 19 – 21 ]. Second, the NHIRD contains no information on the severity of UGIB and AMI; therefore, we were unable to evaluate the severity association between them. Third, some important laboratory data, such as hemoglobin concentrations, and drugs, such as NSAIDs (nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs) and SSRI (selective serotonin r"

Third, some important laboratory data, such as hemoglobin concentrations, and drugs, such as NSAIDs (nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs) and SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), were not available in the NHIRD, therefore, we could not interpret the available results fully and adjust for these variables as contributing factors in this study. Further study about this issue is warranted. Fourth, whereas we observed a temporal association between UGIB and AMI, we were unable to provide the risk estimates of AMI within certain periods of time (e.g. 1, 6, or 12 months of the bleed) and what percentage of patients discontinued aspirin or changed antiplatelet therapy which may affects subsequent AMI.

In addition, while diminished oxygen carrying capacity following UGIB is a plausible explanation, the presentation of AMI in such cases would be acute rather than subacute. A cohort study that recruits a group of CAD patients who have UGIB and follows them over time for AMI episodes after the UGIB including discontinue of aspirin is needed to obtain such estimates. Fifth, we did not identify the origin of UGIB and recurrent UGIB. However, the aim of this study was to evaluate whether CAD patients have a higher risk of developing AMI after UGIB, and therefore further studies that identify the origin of UGIB and recurrent UGIB are warranted for developing more specific prevention strategies.

PMC4691662,PMC4691662_chunk_1,"Introduction
While non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the most widely used drugs, especially among the elderly, who frequently use them on a long-term basis, the benefit–risk balance of individual NSAIDs is chiefly driven by their gastrointestinal and cardiovascular (CV) safety profile, and there have been many studies regarding each outcome. In a recent meta-analysis, the pooled adjusted rate ratio of gastrointestinal complications ranged from 1.81 to 4.22, while the rate ratio for CV complications was estimated around 1.3 among NSAIDs including celecoxib. 1 However, diabetes is a well-known risk factor for CV outcomes which has also been suggested to be an independent risk factor for peptic ulcer bleeding, contributing a population attributable fraction of 4%. 2 Moreover, the 2014 Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes recommend aspirin as a primary prevention for those with increased CV event risk. 3 However, according to the American College of Gastroenterology Guide"
PMC4691662,PMC4691662_chunk_2," the 2014 Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes recommend aspirin as a primary prevention for those with increased CV event risk. 3 However, according to the American College of Gastroenterology Guidelines for Prevention of NSAID-Related Ulcer Complications (ACG Guideline), concurrent use of any one drug among aspirin, corticosteroids, or anticoagulants with NSAIDs is one of the indicators applied to define the group at higher risk of NSAID-induced gastrointestinal toxicity regardless of doses. 4 Therefore, patients with diabetes, who receive prophylactic aspirin, are inevitably at risk of both gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and CV events caused by NSAIDs.
However, beyond the risks from the unavoidable use of aspirin among patients with diabetes with high CV event risk, such patients are at further risk of negative CV outcomes from the use of NSAIDs other than aspirin. The safety profile of different NSAIDs among the group of those at high risk of CV events is not clear and difficult "
PMC4691662,PMC4691662_chunk_3,"at further risk of negative CV outcomes from the use of NSAIDs other than aspirin. The safety profile of different NSAIDs among the group of those at high risk of CV events is not clear and difficult to study by clinical trial due to ethical issues. Furthermore, even though celecoxib was determined to be safe with regard to CV complications, unlike rofecoxib, 5 the association between cyclooxygenase (COX) 2 selectivity and NSAID complications in real-world settings among those at high risk of CV events is an issue that requires further study. Moreover, NSAIDs known to have stronger COX-2 selectivity than celecoxib, such as meloxicam and nimesulide, as well as new COX-2 inhibitors such as etoricoxib, are currently on the market. There are earlier studies looking for an association of aspirin use with CV events among patients with and without diabetes, but none have evaluated the use of other NSAIDs. 6 7 Therefore, we conducted a cohort study on elderly patients with diabetes to assess G"

Patients in both groups had to be at least 65 years old on the index date with no prescription of NSAIDs in the previous year to apply a new-user design in order to control for prevalent user bias such as underestimating early events and altering disease risk factors related to the study drugs. 8 Therefore, NSAID users were selected from the year 2009 to 2011, and among these users, those who had received NSAID prescriptions in 2008 were excluded ( figure 1 ).

Patients in both groups had to be at least 65 years old on the index date with no prescription of NSAIDs in the previous year to apply a new-user design in order to control for prevalent user bias such as underestimating early events and altering disease risk factors related to the study drugs. 8 Therefore, NSAID users were selected from the year 2009 to 2011, and among these users, those who had received NSAID prescriptions in 2008 were excluded ( figure 1 ).

By 1-to-1 propensity score matching, 58 805 patients in each group were selected, comprising a total of 117 610 study subjects ( figure 1 ). Before propensity score matching, the NSAID users and non-users differed in age, comorbidities, and recent medications, while the propensity score-matched cohort resulted in a good balance in all characteristics according to histograms and standardized mean differences <0.1 with a c-statistic of 0.763 ( table 1 ).

Discussion
Even though coxibs are known to have a low risk of GIB among NSAIDs, their CV risk must also be taken into account. However, diabetes is a well-known risk factor of CV diseases, and thus patients with diabetes often receive prophylactic aspirin, which increases the risk of GIB. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the risk of both GIB and CV outcomes among patients with diabetes, comparing NSAID users to non-users, and also to discover different risks among different NSAIDs. All of the IRRs of GIB and CV events exceeded 1 and were at least marginally significant among aged patients with diabetes with various comorbidities and recent medications, indicating a higher risk of both outcomes within patients with diabetes, except for CV events in patients with rheumatoid arthritis where the IRR was not significant due to the small number of patients in this g"
PMC4691662,PMC4691662_chunk_32,"a higher risk of both outcomes within patients with diabetes, except for CV events in patients with rheumatoid arthritis where the IRR was not significant due to the small number of patients in this group. This implies the need to assess the additional risk of both CV events and GIB in patients with diabetes who were being prescribed NSAIDs.
The risk of GIB was higher among patients with liver disease and renal failure. Patients with cirrhosis may develop GIB resulting from esophageal or gastric varices. However, patients with non-cirrhosis liver disease as defined in this study, who probably would have no varices, were also vulnerable to GIB, which indicates that patients with liver disease have a higher risk of non-variceal GIB when treating NSAIDs. Also, in another study, patients with hepatic disease and renal disease had a higher risk of upper gastrointestinal complications from peptic ulcer disease caused by NSAIDs. 15 However, patients with end-stage renal disease are documented"
PMC4691662,PMC4691662_chunk_33,"hepatic disease and renal disease had a higher risk of upper gastrointestinal complications from peptic ulcer disease caused by NSAIDs. 15 However, patients with end-stage renal disease are documented to have a higher risk of peptic ulcer bleeding owing to mechanisms such as platelet dysfunction and blood coagulation abnormalities, 16 and acute renal failure is also proposed to be associated with upper GIB. 17 According to the ACG Guideline, users from the elderly population of any one of anticoagulants, aspirin, and corticosteroids are classified as a group at high risk of NSAID toxicity, while the aHR of GIB was higher only in anticoagulant users. Antiplatelet agents can give rise to GIB by producing ulcers and erosions, while anticoagulants might precipitate bleeding from pre-existing lesions. Even though the preventive effect of PPI or GPA in GIB is well known among NSAID and aspirin users from a variety of studies, it did not show statistical significance. 18 In fact, among 7977 p"

Even though the preventive effect of PPI or GPA in GIB is well known among NSAID and aspirin users from a variety of studies, it did not show statistical significance. 18 In fact, among 7977 patients who received PPI, a total of 67% were prescribed with at least one of the medications among anticoagulants, aspirin, and corticosteroids. Thus, PPI users eventually became more vulnerable to NSAID toxicity and showed a non-significance in GIB despite the prevention of protopathic bias by adjustment of early symptoms of GIB such as gastritis and epigastric pain.
When there are high risks of CV diseases or GIB, the ACG Guideline recommends prescribing PPI with NSAIDs or choosing COX-2 inhibitors. Since the study population is elderly patients with diabetes who are certainly at high risk of both events, the protective effects of the two treatments were compared. Among NSAID users, the aHR of celecoxib use was 1.09 (95% CI 0.79 to 1.50) while that of PPI + NSAID use was 1.10 (95% CI 0."

In other words, the risks of GIB in celecoxib users and PPI + NSAID users were similar, with overlapping CIs without substantial protective effect. While the CONDOR (celecoxib vs omeprazole and diclofenac in patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis) study found results in celecoxib's favor, the main cause behind this result was anemia, whereas the rates of actual upper GIB did not differ between the two groups of celecoxib and PPI + NSAID. 19 This could explain the similar risk between the two groups in this study since each event was counted from the diagnosis of individuals.

Even though aspirin is known to increase GIB risk by direct injury to the gastrointestinal mucosa, this group did not show a significant GIB risk after adjustment. Furthermore, in a former study, while the baseline risk of GIB in the absence of aspirin was higher among patients with diabetes, the use of aspirin was associated with a greater GIB risk only among individuals without diabetes, 6 and the benefit of aspirin was reported to be similar in patients with and without diabetes in a meta-analysis of primary prevention of CV events. 20 The inter-individual variability in drug response or inadequate thromboxane inhibition by aspirin, known as “resistance,” due to the variable turnover of the thromboxane in platelets could describe this, which may be related to glycemic control in patients with diabetes. 21 22 However, the inhibitory effect of aspirin by other NSAIDs is not likely in this study since recent medication use was detected during the follow-up pe"

In another study, the relative risk of upper GIB in patients taking aspirin was higher when used for primary prevention than for secondary prevention, but this difference was more than compensated for by the lower baseline risk in the primary prevention population. Therefore, since aspirin was used for primary prevention of CV events in this study, the protective effect from GIB of aspirin could have been concealed.

However, even though aspirin is a well-known primary prevention strategy in those with diabetes at increased CV risk, it resulted in a higher risk of CV events. Among 43 758 aspirin users, 83.4% were diagnosed with hypertension, 91% were being prescribed antihypertensive medication, and 53.5% were patients with dyslipidemia, who are inevitably considered to be a high-risk group for CV events, especially when combined with diabetes. Thus, confounding by indication is another explanation. However, SSRI users had an unexpectedly high risk of a CV event, while the well-known GIB risk was not shown. An earlier study reported the beneficial evidence of SSRIs in CV events, 23 whereas another study did so only with long-term use. 24 However, depression itself is regarded as a cause of coronary heart disease by two mechanisms: beha"

When each was compared to celecoxib, nimesulide increased the risk of GIB and ketorolac increased the risk of CV events. Nimesulide is a COX-2 selective NSAID and manifested a coxib-like benefit in another study, 30 but this has not been consistent, showing a higher risk of GIB than other non-selective NSAIDs in another study. 31 It is not approved in the USA and was withdrawn in many countries due to its hepatotoxicity. In 2011, the European Medicines Agency made a recommendation that nimesulide be prescribed in acute pain or dysmenorrhea but not in osteoarthritis. However, it is still on the market in Korea as in a few other countries, and 1.6% of the GIB cohort and 2.2% of the CV cohort received it, which corresponds well with 2% use among orthopedic patients in Korea in another study. 32 Even though it could have been prescribed to patients with a higher risk of GIB, thus resulting in a higher risk in this study, lack of evidence on safety so far and the "

The CV risk of ketorolac, a non-selective NSAID, was marginally higher than that of other NSAIDs in this study, which is similar to the findings of other studies both in cases of myocardial infarction 33 and ischemic stroke, 34 with ORs of 2.02 and 1.90, respectively. Naproxen may be the agent of choice among patients with high CV risk, but only 1.8% among the cohort was found to have received it. Specifically, prescribing NSAIDs only by the COX-2 selectivity determined in vitro by the IC50 ratios of COX-1 and COX-2 should be avoided since COX-2 selectivity is not directly correlated with risky outcomes in real life. 35 This could be explained by the kinetic diversity in the COX inhibition mechanism, wi"

This study has some limitations. First, the claims database does not include diagnostic laboratory findings, a family history, or lifestyle factors such as smoking or obesity. Therefore, the reason for higher risk of CV events in aspirin users cannot be interpreted as the risk of the medication itself, but as an indicator of a high-risk group since these prescribers must have a clinical background for prescription and the drugs were being prescribed for reduction of potentia"

Nevertheless, one study showed that a failure to adjust a few potential confounders did not cause notable bias in an example of coxibs and myocardial infarction. 38 Moreover, it was reported in another study that non-gastrointestinal comorbidity is an independent risk factor for GIB and contributes even more than aspirin or NSAIDs. 39 Thus, we used various relevant comorbidities in generating propensity scores for matching NSAID users to nonusers and adjusting the Cox regression models. Second, we identified outcomes and comorbidities by ICD-10 codes. However, in order to increase the validity, the codes were used throughout four digits in detecting GIB events, and outcomes such as myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke "

However, in order to increase the validity, the codes were used throughout four digits in detecting GIB events, and outcomes such as myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke are regarded as difficult to misdiagnose. Third, NSAIDs including aspirin are frequently obtained over the counter. However, due to the national health insurance system in Korea, patients receive most of their medication including aspirin or NSAIDs through prescriptions from clinicians since that is cheaper than purchasing over-the-counter drugs making it possible to detect the use of aspirin or NSAIDs in the claims data. Therefore, misclassification is unlikely to be significant.
Conclusions
In conclusion, elderly patients with diabetes using NSAIDs were at a higher risk of both GIB and CV events compared to non-users, and these risks differed among different NSAIDs in a way that did not correspond directly to COX-2 selectivity."
